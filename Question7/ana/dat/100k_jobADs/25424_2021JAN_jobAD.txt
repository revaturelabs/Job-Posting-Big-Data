NO.Oh, so you’re a personal trainer? NOOh, so you’re a strength coach? NOWait, so what do you do?Believe it or not, this type of exchange actually happens a lot. It’s funny, because athletic trainers (ATs) are everywhere. Most high schools, colleges, semi-pro teams, Olympic teams, professional teams, and basically any organized athletic association has them. Athletic Trainers work for corporations, for the military, as physician extenders, and in the performing arts (Yes, Cirque du Soleil employs athletic trainers for the performers).Athletic Trainers are on TV all the time. Although they’re usually being called “trainers” by the talent at ESPN or your local news organization, so I don’t blame you if you don’t know who we are.I work at a small Division III college in Boston, and along with my colleagues, am responsible for the medical care of our student athletes. We have a team physician who directly oversees us, but we are on the front lines. We evaluate, assess, and rehabilitate injuries. We provide preventative care in order to avoid injuries. We provide manual therapy, corrective exercises, and we utilize modalities when necessary. We participate in continuing education and utilize evidence-based practice based on current medical and scientific research.We do all of this (and more), and we do it because we love it. There is so much more to Athletic Training than taping ankles and stretching hamstrings, although that is all that many people see us as. When people ask me why I got into Athletic Training, or what I love about it, I’m often at a loss for words. It can be difficult to explain why I love a profession that is so drastically overworked and underpaid (when compared to other medical professionals), but I thought today I would give it a shot. Let’s see if I can put into words why I do what I do. (and why I love it so gosh darn much)1. My workday is NEVER the same. The human body is an amazing thing. The same injury on two different people could (and usually will) have two very different healing times and potential for complications. Even something as common as an ankle sprain is going to vary so much from person to person, depending on their physical limitations, structural integrity, movement patterns, etc. Along those same lines, a general return-to-play time after an ACL reconstruction is 6-9 months, but that doesn’t mean that everyone will fall into that timeline, or will do so in the same way. Case in point: last year, we had a week from Hell in which 3 athletes ruptured their ACL within a 7 day period. They all had surgery around the same time, but do you think they all returned to play at the same time, and at the same level? Not a chance. It’s that variation that keeps this job exciting, and always keeps us on our toes.Ever see an ankle that looks like this? We see it a lot.Even the smaller day-to-day activities of athletic training vary. New injuries happen every day, improvements in rehab status, new rehab progressions, etc. All of these keep each day different than the last, which leads to a job that is anything but boring.2. We are always learning. If you are an athletic trainer who is not continuously learning, than you’re doing something wrong. And I’m not just talking about structured, organized Continuing Education programs; I’m talking about doing your best to stay on top of your game every day. To be successful as an AT you have to be hungry for knowledge, because the world of medicine and science changes on a daily basis, and there is research coming out continuously on just about every topic you can think of. True, it’s impossible to read every new research article that is published, but working your hardest to stay on top of new research that is relevant to your practice is imperative. As someone who can’t stand just staying still, I love this about this profession. We are always (hopefully) moving forward, becoming better every day.3. Connecting with amazing people. I would be lying if I didn’t say that (a big) part of the reason I love my job is because of the connections I make with people. Working closely with student-athletes day in and day out helps me get to know them well, and helps me get to learn who they are beyond just a student-athlete. I have been in this profession for close to 8 years now, and have worked with hundreds of student athletes, many of whom I keep in touch with to this day.This (above) is one of my very first student-athletes that I ever worked with. My very first job as an athletic trainer was at a prep school, and Nicole was a freshman ice hockey player there my first year. We have kept in touch over the years, and I was recently able to see her play a game in her senior year of college when her team came to Boston. She was one of the first student athletes that I worked with as an AT, and she remains, to this day, one of the reasons why I love this job so much. I’ve watched her grow up into an intelligent, motivated, and successful person and athlete, and I couldn’t be more proud! (Hey Barty!)4. We’re appreciated. No, we may not always feel appreciated, and sometimes AT’s feel downright ignored. But there are always those student athletes, coaches, and parents who go out of their way to tell us how much they appreciate us, and they make all the difference. I know it sounds cheesy, but it’s true. I got an email from a coach at my last job that I’ve kept to this day, and read it on those days when I just need a reminder that what I do is important. I’ve gotten cards, tweets, emails, and messages from athletes and coaches that have literally brought tears to my eyes. Just over the holidays, we got a couple of tweets that absolutely made my day.@MikeyJr4: “Merry Christmas to the best athletic trainers in the business, Enjoy the day!”and@ShannyNort: “Happy Holidays to Mandy, Steph, and Laura! My wonderful, amazing, helpful athletic trainers who keep me going on the court!”Yes, these are quick little messages, but they mean 1000 times more than just the words written. How often do people in other professions get little notes like this telling them how much they are appreciated? Not too often, unfortunately. Maybe I just work with an incredible group of people, but I love every second of it.5. We witness miracles. Ok, that’s a stretch, because most “miracles” we see come from hard work on the part of ATs, doctors, surgeons, PAs, and mostly from the athletes themselves. But some moments feel like miracles anyway.Imagine watching an athlete go down on the court, and knowing instantly that she’s ruptured her ACL. Imagine sitting with her on the sideline, staying calm and comforting her as she cries, knowing that her season is over. Now imagine that same athlete, after you and she have worked incredibly hard day in and day out for months on end. Imagine watching her battle through the ups and downs of a post-operative rehab program, doing your best to keep her motivated and positive throughout the process. Her next season begins 9 months after her surgery. She not only plays the entire season, injury free, but she leads her team to a conference championship.It gives me chills just thinking about it now. This particular athlete and I actually shared a moment after the final buzzer of the championship game where we both teared up a little, knowing all of the hard work that both of us (but lets be real, mostly her) put in, to get there.Those are the moments that make me love this profession. Those are the moments that keep me going, through the late nights, early mornings, and long days. Those are the moments that make it all worth it, and that keep me coming back for more. The world of athletic training is a crazy one. In this job, you never know what tomorrow will bring, or what type of injury will walk through the door next. This profession brings with it crazy highs and crazy lows, and everything in between. But at this point in my life, I can’t imagine doing anything else.Do you know any athletic trainers? Do you love what you do for work, and why?Spread the Love!TweetEmailMoreShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...RelatedPublished by sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat)Certified Athletic Trainer and CSCS in Boston, with an MS in Applied Nutrition.

I always thought if I could make a living and support my family, while in gym shorts or the fitness industry I would have it made! Congrats!Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 14, 2013 — 9:50 amWhile working in the fitness industry is definitely cool, that’s not what I do (I’m in the Sports Medicine industry), and I don’t wear gym clothes to work either 🙂 Thanks for reading and commenting though!Reply	Our Life In 3D January 14, 2013 — 10:29 amYou are so right. I apologize. I was reading the intro and had a ‘fitness industry’ mindset all the way through the read. I have been to a Sports Medicine Doctor for my shoulders and then my knee and found that work very facinating; the healing and therapy and understanding how the body works that I couldn’t begin to understand. Again, another great job!(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:33 pmThanks so much for your reply, I hope mine did not sound snarky! I appreciate your thoughts as always, and glad you enjoyed the read 🙂 It is certainly an interesting field to be in, that’s for sure!JL January 16, 2013 — 5:58 pmI agree that your post likely reflects what all of us as athletic trainers have experienced; however, I also echo Our Life in 3D’s comments because the blog’s photo, tagline, and tabs are more closely associated with personal training. I read the blog because ATs shared it on facebook. Had I come across your blog on my own, I would have ignored it. It seems it can add to the confusion.(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:34 pmHi JL, thanks for your input! This blog is generally about fitness/nutrition/strength training, but I also have had several readers ask me about what I do for a living, which is why I wrote this post. I’m actually surprised it’s gotten such a big response, but I’m glad! Hope this cleared up some of the confusion for you.Megan February 4, 2015 — 4:39 pmHi, I’m from Crossroads Christian High School and I have a project to interview someone with my dream job. So I was wondering if you could take the time to email be and answer a few questions?(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) February 4, 2015 — 5:38 pmHi Megan, you can find my email address on my “about” page. If you email me, I’d be happy to answer your questions! Looking forward to hearing from you.Gp3 January 14, 2013 — 8:45 amAwesome post. Helps make my decision to back go get a Masters in AT that much more convincing.Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:35 pmGreat!! Glad you liked it 🙂 It’s a challenging field but has great rewards too!Reply	jenn January 14, 2013 — 9:04 amnot entirely the same, but – i ruptured my ACL about 7 years ago, and when i tore my meniscus on top of that last march, finally decided to get the whole kit and caboodle repaired. the two PTs i worked with at our Sports Medicine clinic were my lifesavers – truly some of my favorite people, and they got me up and running (literally) with all of the care and tough love and humor a girl could ask for! it’s a great profession, and as an athlete, i would wholeheartedly trust my PT with my body’s aches and pains any day of the week!Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:37 pmIsn’t it amazing how strong of a bond can form between a patient/athlete and PT/AT? Working with someone so closely for so long, especially following a surgery with a longer recovery, can lead to a great, trusting relationship between patient and caregiver. I’m so glad you had such a good experience with those who worked with you following surgery!Reply	Megan January 14, 2013 — 10:21 amAwesome! I feel like working at a college you are not only a AT to them but a mentor probably as well. I definitely latched on to a few awesome facility at my college who I will hopefully keep in touch with forever!Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:38 pmThere are definitely those times where the student athletes come in more to talk about life than for any kind of injury treatment. For some reason, the AT room turns into a safe haven for a lot of them, which I’m sure you remember from your college days! I love hearing about those who have had good experiences with their ATs 🙂Reply	sten06 January 14, 2013 — 10:26 amwoooo i love hearing about your job!!! you’re awesome 🙂Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:39 pmThanks girl!! You ah 🙂 Now you just need to get back on your blog, you’re too talented to stay away from it for this long!Reply	Sarah @ Blonde Bostonian January 14, 2013 — 10:42 amI debated switching to athletic training when I was at Northeastern. Unfortunately switching from English –> Athletic Training would have meant overloading with science and math classes, probably another year of school, and just a lot of work I wasn’t ready for. I have so much respect for the work you do. Keep it up 🙂Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:40 pmSarah! We would have been classmates!! It definitely would have been a big switch from a liberal arts major to a science major, so I suppose I understand your decision 😉 Thanks so much for your kind words, you made me smile reading this!Reply	Steve Middleton January 16, 2013 — 10:39 pmI started out as a dual-major in English Literature and Theater. I switched after 5 semesters. I completed my undergrad, became certified/licensed. I completed my masters. I just started my doctorate.School was extra work. Clinic hours and school are extra work. But I don’t regret any of it. If you love what you do, you never actually work.Reply	Peggy fillinger January 15, 2013 — 6:00 pmLove seeing this site! I have been in athletic training for about 25 years. Love it, love the population, love the freedom to see parts of the country I wouldn’t have without athletic training. U love making a difference in the amazing lives of my student athletes. I do however hate that the profession makes me choose between my biological children and my athletes, I do however hate the fact that my family has to go without things that would make our lives easier and fun. I do however hate that institutions value the salary of it’s coaches more important but only see a small percentage of the student body and most can’t teach to save their lives. I do hate that athletic trainers come in contact with 100 % of the rosters and still have to teach and most have to secure second jobs to provide. It was very hard to stay in when you were so disrespected by your employers. BUT I love my job and love my athletes. Please help in coming together to make a change and get not only compensation and respect they have so longed for and deserved for a long time.Yours in athletic trainingPeggyReply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:43 pmPeggy! What a wonderful and thoughtful response. I agree with you 100% on everything you wrote here, and I sincerely hope that everyone that reads this post also reads what you wrote. The rewards of this profession are many, but the number of challenges is just as high. There are many many aspects of this profession that I hope to see change over my lifetime; salary and respect for the profession among the highest. Thank you again, keep working hard!Reply	Romello May 13, 2015 — 3:54 pmI’m entering an Athletic Training program in January and I know the pay won’t be “much” when i get out of school (not that I’m getting into the career for the money) but I was wondering which degree do you think would be a good addition to my Athletic Training degree: A masters in Physician Assistant or a DPT degree?(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) May 13, 2015 — 7:21 pmHi Romello! Well… here’s the thing. A PA degree isn’t really an “add on” masters — so if you want to be a PA I’d go that route. If you want to be an athletic trainer, I’d go with a masters in AT or another related field. A DPT is a great option, but is quite a bit more schooling. However, this also gives you the option to practice as a PT down the road and not just an AT. It really just comes down to what your end game is!Roland January 17, 2013 — 9:40 amAgreed… An amazing profession with so many positives, but the items you mention are tragic. It is driving away incredibly talented individuals, forcing them to take “jobs” in other medical fields (btw, NEVER have I felt like my role as an AT was a job). May we all find a way to step up to our administrators/bosses and show our true value… Financially and otherwise!Reply	Tim January 17, 2013 — 5:19 pmAnd that is the darker side of the coin, and the reason that after doing this for 10 years, maxing out my pays cale and having 2 kids that I rarely see, I’m getting out. It’s sad to me that I can go get a job that doesn’t even require a college degree and starting out make $11,000 more than I make now after 10 years and maxing my pay scale. I do love many parts of my job that you already covered. But it just wasn’t enough to sustain me and provide for my family in the way that I want. Anyone going into this profession needs to spend some serious time thinking about what they will give up, because it’s more than a job, it’s a lifestyle, and one that isn’t very conducive to family life. It can be done, but it’s tough. Good write up on the positive aspects of the profession though! Not gonna lie, I’m not going to miss the conversation that follows when people ask what you do….oh, so you work at 24hr fitness? Uhhggggg…..Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 27, 2013 — 9:21 pmTim, I appreciate your honesty!! And I do agree, although there are so many things I love about this profession, there are also so many things that need to change. It is very sad that so many people end up leaving the profession rather quickly… if not for the money, than mostly because of the other reason you mentioned, it is not very conducive to family life. Who knows if I’ll be able to keep doing this once I have a family of my own, because Lord knows I’m not even home enough right now to have a dog!! Thanks again for your comment, I appreciate it 🙂Heather January 15, 2013 — 7:47 pmOf course, only another Athletic Trainer could ever speak such truths about our jobs! Very eloquent! I teared up a bit about your story of your ACL rehab; I just experienced this for the first time a few months ago and it gives me chills to think about still. Keep up the great job!Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:44 pmIt gives me chills every time to think about that story as well, as well as many others! One of the great parts of our job are these amazing success stories 🙂 Thanks for your comment, have a great day!Reply	vintevov16 January 15, 2013 — 8:21 pmWay to represent us fellow ATC! I am an athletic trainer in MI and some days are tough but your are exactly right with the reasons I continue to stay in this career path day in and day out 🙂Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:45 pmI hear you on that one! There are so many challenges that come with this job, but there are so many things that keep me coming back. I’m glad you can relate!Reply	vintevov16 January 15, 2013 — 8:23 pmWay to represent fellow ATC! Some days are defiantly tough but you are exactly right with the reasons why I continue to stay in this career path 🙂Reply	Pierre M. Nesbit January 15, 2013 — 10:55 pmI am currently a senior in Purdue’s Athletic Training Education Program. I can honestly say that you definitely summed up the reasons why this profession is so great and unique. There certainly isn’t a boring, mundane day on the job. I love this profession and I honestly couldn’t see myself going into any other field. I love what I do! This was a great read! Thank you for shedding some light on the profession.Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:46 pmThanks so much for your comment, Pierre. I’m glad you enjoyed the post, and I wish you the very best of luck as you move on from Purdue! There are so many unique opportunities out there; hopefully you find one that is right for you, and that allows you to continue growing as a medical professional 🙂Reply	J Fletcher January 16, 2013 — 12:19 amGood read, enjoyed the piece. IMHO, just be careful saying that you do physical therapy and practice medicine (3rd paragraph) if you are not a licensed PT or MD (unless your state px act allows you to say that; they (or their lawyers) will come after you.Reply	wantzatc January 16, 2013 — 9:39 amWhere does it say “physical therapy?” The description is spot on.Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:49 pmTo be fair, I did have “physical therapy” in the description, see my explanation below. J Fletcher had a good point so I removed it! Thanks for your support though 🙂(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:48 pmValid point! In my mind, physical therapy (as a noun) and rehabilitation are synonymous, but I can see where legally it may not be. Thanks for the input!Reply	Dan January 16, 2013 — 1:24 amAs a newly certified Athletic Trainer, this gives me so much pride and excitement into what I am now doing. My passion for athletic training has grown exponentially these past few years and am so proud to be an ATC. It is great to see the growing awareness and support for athletic trainers!Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:50 pmI’m so glad to hear from you as a “new” ATC! Unfortunately, we have a long way to go in terms of awareness and support, but YOU (and I) can be on the front lines for that. We’ve come a long way even in the short time that I’ve been certified, and I hope that this profession continues to progress over the coming years!Reply	Brian January 16, 2013 — 9:50 amAs a first year graduate assistant athletic trainer at a smaller Division I school, this is an amazingly true statement. Often times I find myself wondering why we choose to do this. I constantly battle student athletes who choose not to show up to rehab, and coaches who do not hold them accountable. I have heard more excuses than one can possibly imagine, yet there is something that brings me back everyday. Sure the fact that I am getting a Master’s degree paid for definately helps, but there is something else. There are those athletes and staff who find a special place in your heart, those that make it worth it to show up on a daily basis. Those special moments before competition, for me its during the national anthem, when my heart is pounding in a nervous but exciting manner. I find myself mentally preparing, praying my athletes stay healthy but preparing my mind for any possible scenario. Its moments like these that bring me back, moments like these that make me love my job and my profession.Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:52 pmOh, the national anthem gets me every time… especially when our school uses the Whitney Houston version 😉 Thanks so much for your comment, I’m so glad to hear from so many ATs who also have a great passion for this profession. Keep up the great work!Reply	Vivien Ip January 16, 2013 — 1:50 pmGood read! I am an international student from Hong Kong, which there is no such thing as an Athletic Trainer. I’ve decide to become one myself the moment I’ve learned about this field. I’m working as an assistant to my AT, almost everyday, even during break, but I did not feel tired at all. There just this one moment, I can tell I really love what I am doing. Although it is really tough to tell people what I am doing back home, and with family member against my will. I do have a supportive mother, even thought she doesn’t have much of an idea what I am doing. Knowing PT and AT is somehow a job to easily get frustrated, she was really surprised at my passion to sports medicine (even myself was somehow surprised). After reading this, I am totally sure this is EXACTLY what I wanted to do in my future.Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 16, 2013 — 8:54 pmWhat an amazing story! I’m sure it is very difficult to explain this profession to your family, especially if they are not very supportive of your decision. I’m glad that you’ve chosen a field that you can be passionate about, and I’m also glad I can help give you some more insight into the profession! Hopefully your parents will come around when they realize that you are doing something you truly want to be doing for a living. Best of luck!Reply	Vivien Ip January 24, 2013 — 1:27 amThank You. I have forwarded this site to some of my family member, and hope they would read about it and understand what I am doing. Although I would never give up what I am trying to do, but having their support is still somehow really important to me.Ling To December 11, 2013 — 10:46 pmHi Stephanie, I want to thank you so much for writing such a wonderful piece about athletic training. I am also an Athletic Trainer at a D III school and wanted to also say how much I agree with all the reasons you love the different aspects of our job. It’s reading blogs/posts/articles like this that allow us to smile at times that maybe tough for us as ATCs.The reason why I have decided to reply under Vivien’s post is because I too, am from Hong Kong. I was born there and have been living in America for about 20 years now. I am first generation in my family to have an education so for them to have a daughter to study something besides being a doctor or lawyer was difficult for them to understand but it pushed me more to want to connect AT to my culture. Which is why I lived in China for a year doing an internship working for a western sports medicine team. It was not until I told my parents I was going that it finally sparked their interest in what I really do for a living. My explanation to my parents was very similar to your post. Not only did the experience and explanation help bring me and my parents closer but it helped open up another pair of eyes to what AT is all about. What is amazing is that not only do we have ATs in so many different settings in America, we also have ATs in other countries now.Athletic Training has grown so much in the past thirty years and will continue to grow with ATs like yourself that stays positive about what we do. Thanks for reading to such a lengthy comment.Reply	Hope January 17, 2013 — 9:33 amI am the wife of an ATC. Your entry summed up my husband’s feelings about the profession. He loves the variety, the athletes, and the coaches. The parents are sometimes a chanllenge, but it is all worth it for him when an athlete is able to compete and improve their life situation through athletics that could have been derailed by an injury.He works at an inner city high school with 300-400 athletes. He covers all 10 sports and 20 teams single-handedly. He is amazing. He loves those athletes like his own kids, and they trust him with their recovery and future. He understands that athletics may be the only avenue his kids have to go to college to make a different life for themselves and their family. It is a responsibility he takes very seriously.It can be a rough profession on a young family, but we are proud of his accomplishments and happy to support him.Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 21, 2013 — 8:57 pmThat is an amazing thing that your husband is doing; thank you for sharing your story!! You are so right that this profession can be tough for a young family, and I’m honestly not sure that I’ll be able to continue doing this if/when I do decide to start a family of my own. It is truly one of the many challenges of this profession, and one reason that so many great ATs leave the profession all together. I hope your husband is able to continue his great work in helping those students reach better things!Reply	eddie lane January 17, 2013 — 11:00 amReply you are the one they all come to when they need a answer. With that said I have a question.. Has anyone ever experienced in any of their athletes an injury to the acl and lateral co-lateral ligaments ?Cannot recall having one when I was on the line.Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 21, 2013 — 8:58 pmMany of them do come to us for answers about many things… more than just injuries! And no, I have not personally had an athlete with an ACL/LCL combo…Reply	Meg February 11, 2013 — 8:29 pmI actually saw one on my first co-op in 2003, patient was a wrestler.Jaime Kent December 12, 2013 — 9:35 pmI currently have a student athlete with a complete rupture of the ACL and LCL. He also tore the VMO, VLO, sprained the MCL, and sustained a large bone bruise.Ed Ryan January 20, 2013 — 5:34 amGreat piece. Very true.Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 21, 2013 — 8:58 pmThank you very much 🙂Reply	Lydia Bridges January 20, 2013 — 9:04 pmWow! Your work is so fullfilling! I love your work. 🙂Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 21, 2013 — 8:59 pmThank you so much! It is challenging, but I really believe the bigger the challenge, the bigger the reward… right? 😉Reply	Sarah January 21, 2013 — 8:44 pmTo avoid being called trainer maybe change your Twitter handle…?Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) January 21, 2013 — 9:00 pmMy twitter handle is @stephdorsay so not sure how that would help… But thanks for the suggestion?Reply	markkev January 23, 2013 — 5:28 pmI have to say that I never heard of athletic training or what an athletic trainer really did when I was growing up in HS. Fortunately, when I was an undergraduate in college, I landed a job as a student assistant in the Athletic Training Room and boy those were the best 3.5 years spent working as a student. I feel in love with it; being around athletes, coaches, trainers and most importantly Sports! I’m applying to PT schools now but I have a dream of going back and getting into an entry level program to get ATC certified lol.Reply	Vivien Ip January 24, 2013 — 1:35 amI am a student trainer and a assistant to my AT in my college too! Many people never know what an ATC does, and always confused them with trainers. But I have to really agreed that if you are passionate about sports, you will be easily falling in love with this profession, and once you’re IN LOVE with it, there’s NO WAY OUT!Reply	Katmah February 6, 2013 — 2:01 pmReblogged this on katmah and commented:I love this! Really shows a good picture of the profession and the people involved.Reply	Katmah February 6, 2013 — 2:04 pmHi! I’m an athletic therapy student and a athlete who is all too good at getting injured (I have a very good relationship with my ATs). Just wanted to let you know I loved this post! It gets me excited about what I’m studying and reminds me of how much I love it. Definitely something I read when I’m having a rough day studying! The ATs I’ve worked with have truly been role models and are huge inspirations to me as an athlete and a student. I hope one day I can be the same to other athletes and people alike!Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) February 11, 2013 — 8:40 pmThank you for reblogging this! I’m glad that I have been able to reach some AT students with this post, and I love hearing from students who are truly passionate and excited about getting into this crazy field. Keep working hard, and if you keep that passion, you’ll be an inspiration to many, I’m sure!Reply	Katmah February 11, 2013 — 8:49 pmI’ve shared it with a few of my friends at school too, love it!markkev February 11, 2013 — 8:46 pmReblogged this on MK strength & conditioning.Reply	Pingback: Athletic Training: Why I Love My Job « Board of Certification, Inc.	Pingback: Start a Blog and Find a Job - Venture Jobs	Dustin Hageman March 12, 2013 — 11:10 ami am doing a report on athletic training and i was just wondering what is the name of the person that wrote this blog.Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) March 12, 2013 — 11:26 amHi Dustin, my name is Stephanie d’Orsay, you can find more (credentials, etc) on my “About Me” page.Reply	Ashley Wu October 17, 2013 — 10:12 pmI’m a senior in high school and I’m struggling to find what I want to do and since I’m 17 it’s completely acceptable. I was at a football game and a guy got injured and I saw this girl I knew who was helping him of the field since she was in a sports medicine class. I did some research and I stumbled upon this post. I was talking to my sister about possibly being an AT but she kept saying that it doesn’t get paid enough for all schooling it takes. She also said that she would be worried if I do all this schooling and I won’t have a job after because AT’s aren’t in high demand so that got me worried and I was curious as to how hard it would be for me to find work. I absolutely love sports and I would just love to just be there and help out athletes! And how much schooling does it really take??Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) October 18, 2013 — 8:10 amHi Ashley, Thank you so much for reaching out! I start out by being perfectly honest that most AT’s don’t get paid as much as we probably should. Compared to other medical professionals, the average salary is pretty low (I believe it is around 45-55,000/yr for a college AT). As for schooling, ATs must get a bachelors degree at an accredited AT program and then must sit for the national certification exam. Following that, most ATCs then will go on to get their Master’s degrees (I think it’s something like 80% of working ATs have their Master’s or higher). It is very difficult to find a job without a higher ed degree, but it does not have to necessarily be in athletic training. My MS is in Nutrition, for example. As for ATs being in high demand, it really depends where you are located. Somewhere like Boston, they are in very high demand, due to the number of colleges and high schools in the area that employ ATs. There are some states though, that do not have laws mandating that high schools have ATs, so job opportunities in those states might be less. What I can say is that if it is something you are passionate about, follow your heart and do it. But although it is very rewarding, it is also a tough profession (long hours, weekends, etc.), so you have to be ready for that. If you have any other questions or would like some more information about what I do, please email me at itrainthereforeieat@gmail.com, I would love to help out as much as I can!Reply	Meghan December 11, 2013 — 8:29 pmI’m a senior athletic training major and right now with finals bearing down and clinical’s everything seems so crazy and sometimes I think I should have chosen another major. But after reading this I know I’m in the right field and am ready to move on and be an ATC. Thank you for writing this and reminding me why I wanted to go into this field in the first place.Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) December 15, 2013 — 1:43 pmThanks, Meghan! Good luck with your finals, and remember that this profession does get awfully difficult sometimes, but if you truly love it, it’s worth it. Keep working hard!Reply	janice December 11, 2013 — 8:49 pmI’ve been working as an ATC for 7 yrs at the same high school. Not even 15 minutes ago a parent walked into the gym for a JV basketball game and handed me an eggnog shake! My favorite! You do end up building very strong relationships with athletes and their families. I love being involved so closely with a good network of people. Our job is awesome. It is such a compliment when I hear a student say they want to grow up and “be like Janice” (meaning they want to be an athletic trainer).Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) December 15, 2013 — 1:45 pmThat’s great Janice! I really do love the amazing connections you make with people — especially after you’ve been at one place for a while and some of the families really start to see you as a person, and not just someone who works with their son/daughter! My colleague was actually brought a homemade Thanksgiving dinner a couple of years ago after a parent heard she would not be traveling home for the holiday. Love stories like that!Reply	Q Sawyer December 12, 2013 — 12:41 pmgreat article! keep up the great workReply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) December 15, 2013 — 1:46 pmThanks Q!

Bitter sweet, I’m sure 🙂Reply	Genni Miller December 12, 2013 — 6:16 pmI’ve been an ATC for 25 years now (yes, I’m one of the “old guys/gals”) I love it and couldn’t imagine doing anything else.(Much to my mother’s dismay)Reply	eddie December 12, 2013 — 11:36 pmIs it only 25 I can remember you back further than that.best to your Mom And Dad and a hello to DamonGood trainers if they last long enough become excellent trainersReply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) December 15, 2013 — 1:47 pmHaha, I still think my mother doesn’t quite understand what it is I do!Reply	Jackie December 12, 2013 — 11:04 pmMy daughter is waiting to hear if she is accepted into the AT program at Uconn. Hopefully she will receive a phone call with acceptance soon. It is her passion. She has had great relationships with high school and college ATs while playing soccer. They have helped her during injuries and gotten her back on the field. Her heart and soul are just waiting for the phone call!Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) December 15, 2013 — 1:47 pmGood luck to your daughter!! I remember waiting to hear about my acceptance to NU. All of the programs are competitive, so it can be nerve wracking. I wish you and her the very best!Reply	Eileen shifflett December 12, 2013 — 11:31 pmMy son, a high school senior, suffered a broken bone and 2 torn ligaments in his toe during football season. He missed the majority of the season but through his resolve and with the assistance of his athletic trainer Jen, he is close to being cleared to play basketball and then baseball. We are so grateful to Jen who has shown so much professionalism and concern while caring for him over the past three months. She has not only helped him heal physically but she was such a tremendous help to him mentally. We will always be grateful to her for helping him salvage his senior season!Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) December 15, 2013 — 1:49 pmWhat a great story, and I’m happy to hear that he’s going to be able to carry on with his two other sports! ATs do often deal with the mental side of injuries just as much as the physical side, and it’s even more difficult when you know it’s someone’s senior/last year. Congrats to Jen for doing such a great job, and congrats to your son for pushing through!Reply	Julie Bigelow December 13, 2013 — 12:25 amI just got my first job as an ATC out of college in August at a small college prep high school. It’s k-12 and it has about 500 kids total. They haven’t had an athletic trainer there for about 3 years and the welcome I got from the students and parents was overwhelming. After our volleyball team won states a couple weeks ago, all the parents came up to me and gave me a hug and thanked me for taking care of their daughters during the season. It reassured me that I was appreciated and that I was needed at this school. Thank you so much for this article. I can’t tell you how many times I have been asked if I can help someone in shape. I think this article is going to really spread awareness about our profession 🙂Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) December 15, 2013 — 1:50 pmThank you so much Julie, and I really hope we can spread a little awareness in a positive way! It sounds like you’ve landed a job where you are very much appreciated, which is so important. Congrats, and keep up the great work!Reply	kelsnsher December 13, 2013 — 7:22 amLoved this post, I don’t currently work in a setting as an ATC (I went back to grad school for Health Promotion) but I still use the same principles, and sometimes the same skills in my current job. I have a special place in my heart for any ATC who loves their job, so keep it up girl 🙂Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) December 15, 2013 — 1:51 pmThank you! I actually thought about health promotion for a while… it’s good to see other ATCs doing big things in this world!Reply	sam December 13, 2013 — 2:25 pmYea…..in other words….were pretty awesome– From another AT 🙂Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) December 15, 2013 — 1:51 pmWe are pretty awesome, huh? 🙂Reply	K December 13, 2013 — 9:37 pmHi there. I just wanted to say that as a senior athletic training student, this couldn’t have been more accurate. The team I am working with now, we had a freshman sprain his ankle horribly. He was out for a good 2 months if not longer and finally played in his first game a week ago. We ended up learning this week that he got rookie of the week for our conference. It was such a great feeling and the certified, myself, and the other student were so proud, especially when we think to ourselves that if it weren’t for our teamwork, he wouldn’t be where he is now.Reply	(Post author)sdorsay (itrainthereforeieat) December 15, 2013 — 1:53 pmAwesome!! It’s such a good feeling, isn’t it? I’ve had a couple athletes return this season after major surgeries, and it is just so satisfying to see them play, and play well at that! Congrats to your athlete — I am sure he is so grateful to have you all on his side!Reply	Kate Flynn December 17, 2013 — 12:55 amLoved your post about ” athletic training : why I love my job” I am an athletic therapy student from a college in Canada and our program chair sent us all the link to this post!

What collage courses I should take? Am I able to play softball and become an AT? Is that something reasonable?
