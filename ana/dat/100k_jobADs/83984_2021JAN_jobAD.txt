But the fact that I got the eqip is good news. 7 weeks is a bit much though. You figure they reviewed everything already, so all they need to do is get the thumbs up from your doctor. That's what happened in my case.Geo - Central East CoastCBPO Exam - 10/18/2013NOR - 10/24/2013TSL - 1/30/2014VBT #1 - 3/12/14 (out of country)PFT1/medical - 3/20/2014VBT/SI #2 - 5/15/2014 (eligible 5/22/2014)eQuip/fingerprints - 9/29/2014CommentPostCancelisnaberoForum MemberJoin Date: Feb 2014Posts: 59ShareTweet#4334609-24-2014, 06:34 PMOriginally posted by SendHelp View PostI would send two back.

For most, 1 year is the 1/2 way mark. My 1 year mark was in August and I just submitted my BI docs last week. Although, when I took the exam the instructor told my whole group to expect about 24 months of wait time so I knew going into this things would take a while.CommentPostCancelCabo-verdeForum MemberJoin Date: Sep 2014Posts: 73ShareTweet#4335009-24-2014, 09:00 PMOriginally posted by action-packed View Postcould be worse.
