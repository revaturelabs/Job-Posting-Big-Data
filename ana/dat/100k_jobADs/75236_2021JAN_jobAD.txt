TriAx Geogrid’s multi-directional properties leverage triangular geometry, one of construction’s most stable and widely utilized shapes, to provide an enhanced level of in-plane stiffness. Its triangular structure, coupled with improved rib and junction geometry, offers the construction industry an improved alternative to conventional materials and practices. TriAx Geogrid is manufactured from a punched polypropylene sheet oriented in multiple, equilateral directions to form its triangular aperture, resulting in high radial stiffness throughout the full 360 degrees. This feature yields a more efficient product that delivers optimal in-service stress transfer from the aggregate to the stabilizing geogrid.TX5 BROCHURECONTACT USProduct Specifications:TX7 BROCHURETX130 BROCHURETX140 BROCHURETX160 BROCHUREFollowContactinfo@jobsiteproducts.com(800) 298-4900Address4321 Township Line Rd, Skippack, PA 19474, USA©JOBSITE PRODUCTS INC. 2018-2021.
