My wife and I were first time home buyers and Job made us feel comfortable the entire process. He was available to answer all of our questions at any time of the day or night and always replied promptly. He was never pushy and always professional. Job provided excellent Comparable Market Analysis for the house and area. He made this process super easy and his experience/knowledge was superb. I would highly recommend Job for novice buyers all the way to experienced buyers. Either way, he can handle all your real estate needs.	— SheldonAboutJob HammondPhone512.632.0757Email MeSearch ListingsGet In TouchThank you for contacting us, we'll get back to you shortly.Sorry, we are unable to send your message at the moment.
