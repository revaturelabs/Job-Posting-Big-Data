The volunteer project began on May 19, 2019 with the power washing of the front awning, the painting of the peeling window panels, and the painting of the poles of both lampposts to match. BIMBO Bakeries Staff also donated a second bike rack, a second picnic table, and all-weather flower planters to the library. All the improvements are very much appreciated by patrons and staff. The second bike rack was being used just a day after it was installed.The library is now participating in AmazonSmile.
