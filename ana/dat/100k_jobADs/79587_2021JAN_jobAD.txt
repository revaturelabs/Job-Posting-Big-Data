Students are learning to work together, discuss things ‘like a real group of engineers’ Helen Wilks – Careers Advisor said. It is enabling students to relate their hands on experience back to real life situations and how it would probably be used and what can be achieved. Whether they be future apprentices or engineers, the experience has been invaluable and encouraged students to reconsider their future careers paths.Student Jye O’Neill has brought photos from himself learning and participating in the TTIM Program to job interviews. By showing and explaining what he does with the TTIM program, he has been successful in obtaining work experience with manufacturing company Honeywell. Invaluable positive feedback from manufacturing companies such as Honeywell is being communicated to schools such as St Pius about the TTIM Program.Helen Wilks, Career Advisor says ‘ students are coming away excited and motivated about their engineering future’ and ‘it has been exciting to watch students solving problems, working as part of a team and learning invaluable communication skills’.Previous Post Careers in Aerospace Next Post What is a Shipwright?SearchRecent PostsWOMEN IN AVIATION – EMERGING LEADERS FORUM2020 Hunter F1 in Schools™ Regional FinalsSTEM DEFENCE + INNOVATION PITCH NIGHT SUCCESS!INDUSTRY – SCHOOL COLLABORATIONSTEM DEFENCE + INNOVATION PROGRAM UPDATECategoriesCase StudiesEventsLatest NewsOpportunitiesUncategorizedSubscribe to our NewsletterName*First LastCompany*Email*CAPTCHAThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.Proud Funding PartnerContactsBlock A, 226 Maitland Road, Tighes Hill NSW+61 4940 8355rick.evans@rdahunter.org.auFacebookYouTubeInstagramRSSPrivacy PolicyMenu"
