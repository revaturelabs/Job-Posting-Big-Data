The videos were brilliant. Particularly the strategies and tips on how to approach the tests. The practice tests really helped with improving my timings. It helped me to control the panic too! I was successful in getting the job.\"Suzanne West\"Immediate access which was great, to numerous video tutorials, study guides and tests - quite close to the real thing. Timed tests are extremely useful as they get you accustomed to the fast pace. Explanations were very good in general. All in all a very good kit. Allow yourself several days for the preparation. Definitely money well spent.\"Tsveta Petrushinova\"I aced my logic test and landed a permanent role at the Open University thanks to these practise tests.

Instructions were clear and very easy to navigate. Plenty of practice tests with clear instructions and examples. Timed tests helped give a good indication of what to expect. I passed my job test and it was thanks to the confidence gained by JobTestPrep.\"Karen Alliston\"I have tried Green Turn, Graduate Monkey and Assessment Day. And whilst they are great to get more practice - Job Test Prep is the best one - very detailed, everything is explained step by step and the prep videos and info are tailored to your needs.
