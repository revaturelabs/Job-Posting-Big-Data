Conflicting demands, internal politics, or just having too much to do and too little time. This can all make it hard to enjoy work. But, it doesn’t have to be this way. We want to be happy at work, knowing that it is fulfilling and rewarding. So, what steps can you take to ensure your job is something that you love?#1 Stay positive when at workApproaching work with a negative frame of mind is a sure fire way to get down about your job. Instead, thinking positively about what you are doing can help you to enjoy your work. If you’re finding this hard, you could think about what work allows you to do with your life and the opportunities it brings; meeting new people, travelling, new experiences.#2 Get organised and plan your timeYou’ll soon get fed up of work if you find yourself overwhelmed by the day to day tasks. Use to-do lists to prioritise your daily work. This way, you’ll have a much clearer idea of what you need to get done. It will also help you to structure your day, to make sure the most important tasks get done first.#3 Keep your mind on the task at handIt’s easy for your mind to wander, especially when you have a longer project to work on. But maintaining focus can help you to really get into the project. When you have longer tasks to complete, block out your calendar and switch off all distractions. Let phone calls go to voicemail and resist the temptation to check your inbox. All the messages will still be there when you’ve finished work. This way, you’ll at least have dedicated time to get on with a particular task.#4 Make sure your responsibilities are clearSometimes, difficulties at work can occur because people are not sure what they are responsible for. If at any point you are uncertain about what tasks you are responsible for, then ask. Otherwise, the uncertainty can cause unnecessary stress and doubt.#5 Delegate as much as possibleOften there seems to be too much work and not enough time. One of the best ways to prevent this is by delegating tasks. Draw up a list of everything you do and then divide this into two columns. The first should be tasks that you have to do yourself. The second should be tasks that could be done by others. Using this second list, you should then be able to ask colleagues for assistance in getting jobs done.#6 Have regular breaksWhen you are busy, it might be counterintuitive to take breaks. But, being tired, hungry or thirsty is no way to make your job more enjoyable. Even if it’s only 10 minutes to have a cup of tea, the time will be well spent.#7 Keep your work in perspectiveBeing caught up in the middle of a project can make it hard to see the wider picture. But, keeping perspective of how work fits into your whole life can help make tasks seem less daunting.#8 Review your day’s progressAt the end of each day, spend a few minutes thinking about what you achieved. This will help you realise what you have accomplished. It will also give you time to consider what still needs to be completed. That way, when you come into work in the morning, you can get started straight away.#9 If all else fails, consider looking for a new roleDespite your efforts, if your current role remains unfulfilling, you should evaluate your other options. This includes looking for new opportunities, which better match your needs.
