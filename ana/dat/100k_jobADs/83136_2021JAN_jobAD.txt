This 4 bedroom pool home had a beautiful converted garage. The room gained was a nice bonus room but posed a big problem. The garage was missing, and most buyers who looked at the house wanted a garage. The owner was willing to convert the garage back with a good offer. But that did not satisfy most buyers since they already fell in love with the bonus room and did not want to give up the extra space. The house went under contract but financing fell through with the first buyer. The staging helped to overcome the issues. After a total of 44 days on the market the property went under contract with a purchaser that was able to close. The property had undergone a cosmetic renovation to cure some condition issues. The kitchen was fixed up with the existing cabinets and granite counters. The low hanging soffit was removed to create a more open kitchen and some additional pantry cabinets were added to allow for more storage. The hallway closet was removed to open the entry way and convert some dead space to usable living area. Then the dirty family room carpet was exchanged to tile floors. Paint, repairs and a few bathroom counters did the rest in the fix up process. The staging followed a more family oriented comfortable style. The dining room wall received a dark grey back wall with mirror accents for added interest. Check out the video that shows the staging very well.Share this:Tweet« Another staging home sold and closed – 5326 Lanyard Ct, Winter Park	New redesign house in West Volusia County »	ArchivesSeptember 2020July 2020March 2020November 2019August 2019July 2018May 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018November 2017July 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016October 2016September 2016August 2016July 2016June 2016May 2016April 2016March 2016February 2016January 2016December 2015November 2015October 2015September 2015August 2015July 2015June 2015Subscribe to Blog via EmailEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.Email Address	PagesOrlando Staging ServicesBlogInterior DesignGalleryAbout UsWhy Staging?LocationContact UsPagesOrlando Staging ServicesBlogInterior DesignGalleryAbout UsWhy Staging?LocationContact UsArchivesSeptember 2020July 2020March 2020November 2019August 2019July 2018May 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018November 2017July 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016October 2016September 2016August 2016July 2016June 2016May 2016April 2016March 2016February 2016January 2016December 2015November 2015October 2015September 2015August 2015July 2015June 2015CategoriesInterior Design (80)Renovating (14)Staging (36)Tips (23)Uncategorized (11)WordPressLog inWordPress(C) copyright Helene Bonello-Strauss, repost are allowed with following ID in post \"post by Orlando Staging https://www.idesigntosell.com\""
