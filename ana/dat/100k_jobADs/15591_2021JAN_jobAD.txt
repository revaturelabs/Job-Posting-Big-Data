We treat patients who need more time than usual to begin a recovery before being discharged home or transferred to the next level of care. Typical patients include those on ventilator support, experiencing multi-system organ failure or multiple chronic illnesses. Because patients require a longer stay and a more resource-intensive level of care, our hospitals provide a unique setting for professional development and engagement. We have opportunities in nursing, physical therapy, speech and respiratory therapy, pharmacy, leadership and other support roles. Learn more about Select Specialty Hospital.Not Ready to Apply?
