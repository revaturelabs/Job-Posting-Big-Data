The bill also repeals the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act, which would likely increase health insurance premiums by at least 10 percent annually and lead to millions more Americans being uninsured. Americans making $75,000 or less - including 70 percent of Muslim Americans - could also see their taxes increase by 2027.Poligon Acting Executive Director Afif Rahman issued the following statement:“Many faith traditions, including Islam, call on us to protect and help the most vulnerable in our society. This bill goes against these common values and instead gives the wealthy and corporations massive tax cuts that are ultimately paid for by low- and middle-income Americans. The overwhelming majority of Americans have consistently voiced that this plan does not benefit them and instead benefits a wealthy minority at their expense. Passing this bill sends a signal to the public that members of Congress have ignored their voices in favor of narrow special interests.”Poligon believes that the strength of our nation and our economy is defined by the safety, security, welfare, and opportunities afforded to those who are the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society. Access to quality education and healthcare, economic opportunity, and financial stability form an essential foundation for a stronger, inclusive, and equitable country. This tax bill threatens this foundation and the lives of millions of Americans, and it is a stain on our history as a nation. Poligon will continue to urge Congress to protect and advance policies and programs that preserve and expand fair pathways to success for all Americans.Poligon Education Fund is a non profit, non-partisan organization working to strengthen Muslim American engagement with Congress through research and education on issues of concern to the community and its allies.
