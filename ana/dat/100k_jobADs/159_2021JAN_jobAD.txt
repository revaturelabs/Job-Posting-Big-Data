ChollyThe Fed, as expected, decided yesterday to leave rates unchanged. Fed Chairman Powell’s comments came across more “hawkish” than “dovish” and this seemed to disappoint some traders in the market who were looking for a rate cut. Bottom line here is that the labor market remains strong and the Fed expects wages to increase. That is the main reason why the current low inflation environment is considered to be transitory. It won’t last. More people working and earning more money will spend more money.So, not only is the Fed not leaning towards a rate cut at this time, but it’s possible to see a rate later in the year. They didn’t say those words, but they did say that the economy is in good shape!Silver futures and other precious metals remain under pressure.
