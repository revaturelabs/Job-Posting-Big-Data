It can be found in the heart of Middlesbrough city centre.Tags : coronavirusHillier Jewellers	previous articleAstrid & Miyu launches several initiatives to support NHS	next articleE-COMM ADVICE: Jewellers need a creative email strategy during the pandemic	The author Stacey HailesEditor, Professional Jewelleryou might also likeThousands of small businesses win big in pandemic insurance payoutsHSE stepping up spot checks of businesses still operating during lockdownLights are out at 25% of Pandora’s stores worldwideScottish jewellers cannot offer click and collect from Saturday in new tougher lockdownSmall business owners voice fears of collapse as restrictions take their tollLeave a Response Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment.MOST READ »TOP TEN: The wealthiest diamond company owners and investors in the worldQ&A: Green Rocks Diamonds UK sales manager Maiko EatonThousands of small businesses win big in pandemic insurance payoutsNew head of Goldsmiths’ Fair eyes physical and digital event for autumn 2021UNOde50 embraces optimism for 2021 with new Indomitable collectionDigital Edition »To view current and back copies of the digital edition please click on the magazine cover aboveMedia Pack »Click here to download our Media Pack to learn more about print and online advertising opportunities with Professional Jeweller.Copyright © 2019 Promedia Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved.This website uses cookies to improve your experience.
