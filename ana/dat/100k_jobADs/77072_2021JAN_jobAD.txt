Covid-19 has accelerated this development, but it is still no excuse not to proactively engage with the JRS.“Unite will be working with our shop stewards to support members at this difficult time and actively explore further ways to reduce the number of proposed redundancies. It is a bitter blow.“Unite will seek assurances from the company that the redundancies will be carried on a voluntary basis, as promised in today’s announcement.“One piece of good news is that, following pressure from the trade unions, the company amended its original plans and halted the offshoring of any more contact centre jobs. This resulted in saving 700 UK jobs.”Share this:Post navigationPrevious PostUnite Scotland launches Save Off-Shore jobs campaign amid oil and gas crisisNext PostBeer delivery ‘summit’ called for by Unite to hammer out health & safety blueprint as coronavirus lockdown eases	Leave a Reply	Cancel replyShow moreThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
