turns out to be incorrect. This is usually because of incorrect planning or bad decisions.If there are shortcuts already created and they need to be replaced, the Shortcut repair job type can easily solve this problem, while keeping the database and storage size under control.The shortcut repair job is a mailbox crawler – it scans the live mailboxes and locates contentACCESS shortcuts. It is able to locate all types of shortcuts: Keep original, HTML and Normal shortcuts as well.The whole mailbox is scanned, but the administrator can define which folders should be included and excluded.Note: You can’t use “%INBOX%” in the Include folders section and use the language independent default folders.Important: The Shortcut repair job will NOT take the shortcut settings from Archive settings override.Was this helpful?
