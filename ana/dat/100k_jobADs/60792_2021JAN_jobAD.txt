However, the common denominator is that each client will experience clarity and forward movement in the area they choose to focus on. Through my proven coaching process, I help clients cut through the clutter of whatever area of their life they are most focused on and desire change. Examples include:Managing teams and boards more effectivelyManaging career paths more intentionallyCommunicating executive presence more powerfullyDealing with difficult people and costly relationshipsCreating greater self-awareness; providing new perspectivesWhat results have clients reported after working with you?\"You provided the sounding board and guidance I needed to feel more confident and focused in my new leadership role.\"\"Carol helped me gain more self-awareness about what things I control, what things I influence, and what things are out of my control.\"\"Carol helped me clarify what I most want in my life so I'm able to focus on creating plans and getting things done.\"\"For the first time I was able to see and really understand other perspectives, and see other possibilities.\"What do clients say about working with you?\"Carol brings a deep understanding of the human dynamics and the economic realities at play in today's workplace. Her organizational savvy meant that we could hit the ground running... she really understood what was going on in my organization and I leave every coaching session with very clear thinking about how I want to proceed.\"Trade Association Executive Director\"I'm glad to recommend Carol Vernon to anyone seeking a collaborative partnership dedicated to their success. Carol's naturally warm style meant that she connected with me and those around me easily to help me gain more awareness about what's working and what's not.
