Talk to a lawyer to learn more about driving for professional purposes after a DUI.If you are convicted of a DUI, you will face a number of consequences, both in your personal life and via the criminal system. One of those consequences is the potential suspension of your driver’s license. If your driver’s license is suspended, here is what you should know about for how long that suspension will last and what you should do if you need to drive for professional purposes:How Long Will a Driver’s License Suspension Last in Texas?When a person is convicted of a DUI, he or she will face a license suspension period of 90 days (and up to two years in some cases). During the time that a license is suspended, it is against the law to operate a motor vehicle; doing so can result in additional charges and may negatively affect your ability to reinstate your license.What is an Occupational or Provisional Driver’s License?If your license is suspended but you have a need to drive for work or for school, the court may grant you what is known as an occupational or provisional driver’s license. Using this type of license, there are strict guidelines about when you can drive and to where you can drive. For example, you may only be granted permission to operate a vehicle in connection with your work, or to perform certain household duties and chores that could otherwise not be completed. If you need to drive to find a job, you will need to file a petition with the court applying for a license and demonstrating your need. It is strongly recommended that you work with an attorney who can assist you in this process, as working with an attorney can improve your chances of your license being approved.Challenging a Driver’s License Suspension in TexasYour other option for maintaining the right to drive after being convicted of a DUI is to challenge the suspension of your license.
