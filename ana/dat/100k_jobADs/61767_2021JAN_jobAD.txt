I even tell all my fans I'm happily married with kids.\"On my profile page I will never post anything revealing, just maybe a picture of me getting out of the shower just to tease but without showing anything.\"I then wait for men to message me and I build a relationship.\"Only then will I post a topless photo or just me in my undies.\"The ‘middle-aged mum’ said she can’t believe how many people buy her photos.
