Not all students are destined for college, notes Bernard McCune, the new head of CPS Office of College and Careers, yet many will need a “piece of paper” besides a high school diploma.

Now college and career coaches will guide those students as well.The move is in line with the district’s much-needed efforts to revamp career and technical education. About a quarter of high school students—some 24,000–take a career and technical education class, but only 3,100 complete a full battery of courses, and even fewer earn industry-issued credentials, according to Catalyst analysis.Seven of the first 12 schools that got college coaches in 2005 continue to outpace other schools in sending graduates to college, according to recently released 2008 data. Currently about 50 high schools have coaches. That will grow to 67 next year, McCune says.Initially, central office picked up the full tab. Beginning this year, schools have had to pay half. Since the coaches are not on the teacher salary schedule, they cost less than a counselor would – about $41,000 a year, compared to up to $79,000 for a certified counselor. Coaches must have only a bachelor’s degree.Everett Edwards, principal at the School of Entrepreneurship on the South Shore campus, says the outlay from this budget is worth it. He says his coach helped send nearly 60 percent of last year’s graduates to college, compared with 34 percent the year before.“Because it seems to be working, we want to keep it,” he says. “We will have to rethink other things.”The college coach program is a hallmark of Greg Darnieder’s tenure as head of the office of post-secondary education. Darnieder is now a special assistant on college access to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.In launching the program, he said: “The question is, `Can I put a little bit of money on the table and make a difference?’” Apparently, that’s happened, as the program has had some success.Want more stories like this?Get the latest from the Reporter delivered straight to your inbox.Subscribe to our free email newsletter.SIGN UPMoreMore on Catalyst ChicagoSubscribe to Catalyst ChicagoAbout Sarah KarpSarah is the deputy editor of Catalyst Chicago.More by SarahRelated StoriesAsian Americans don’t see same returns on education as whites in ChicagoThe “model minority” stereotype masks the diversity of experiences and racial inequities faced by the city’s Asian Americans, as detailed in a new report.Public universities increasingly out of reach for Illinois’ low-income studentsDeep cuts to higher education are pushing black, Latino and other first-generation college hopefuls out of a path to upward economic mobility, a new report shows.City Colleges scholarship has benefits, drawbacksSince City Colleges began taking applications for a plan widely advertised as “free college” by a campaigning Mayor Rahm Emanuel, more than 1,000 students have applied for the offer of waived tuition, books and school fees.
