Then you might be on the fast track to burnout at work, according to a recent Spanish study.Researchers sent a questionnaire to university employees in different fields in order to categorize different burnout types; they narrowed it down to three. Can you relate?The Frenetic BurnoutThe signs: Workaholics, beware. If you’re so ambitious that you sacrifice your health and personal life for success, exhaustion is in your future. The study found that those working more than 40 hours a week were most likely to say that they overlook their own needs to meet work demands, compared to those working fewer than 35 hours a week. (Yes, a duh—but one you can probably relate to.)The fix: “Put your personal life and health first,” says lead study author Jesús Montero-Marín, Ph.D., professor at the University of Zaragoza in Spain.Sure, easier said than done, so how’s this for motivation: Prioritize fitness and you can be even more productive. In fact, cardio can make you 15 percent more productive, as we reported in The Aristocracy of Cardio. In theory, this means you can accomplish in an 8-hour day what would otherwise take you 9 hours and 25 minutes—leaving even more time to spend with your family.The Underchallenged BurnoutThe signs: You feel indifferent and can’t find personal fulfillment in your position, says Montero-Marín. The study found that those in administration jobs were most likely to have this type of burnout, compared to teachers and researchers.The fix: If you’re plugging numbers in to Excel all day, try to take on more challenging tasks. “If you feel stuck in an unsatisfying job, try to take on a variety of projects to make it more interesting,” explains Greg Marek, senior director of marketing at MarketTools, Inc. “Try to improve your current job while looking for a new one,” he told us in Quit Your Crappy Job. “You might surprise yourself and want to stay.”The Worn-Out BurnoutThe signs: “You feel like you have little control over results,” says Montero-Marín, “and your efforts go unacknowledged.” People working for more than 16 years were more likely to be worn out, when compared to those working less than 4 years. (Sixteen years and no recognition?! Who wouldn’t feel like crap?)The fix: Are you going above and beyond? If not, that's the first step. \"Volunteer to take on more work when people go on vacation,\" says Paul Powers, Ph.D., the author of Winning Job Interviews. \"Take on work from another department so that other people take notice of your strengths.\"But if you're really miserable, start taking on side projects outside of work, he says. What do you really want to do? Be proactive by volunteering, starting a website, or networking with the right people. \"You'll feel better as soon as you think you're moving in the right direction,\" says Powers.For more job advice, check out Do You Have Office A.D.D.? and Worry Your Way to the Top.Kiera Carter Kiera Carter has a decade's worth of experience covering fitness, health, and lifestyle topics for national magazines and websites.This content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.
