This could be exacerbated by a second coronavirus wave or by local lockdowns in areas across the North already hit hard by austerity.Autonomy's new proposal would see employees in the public sector, including civil servants and local government workers, move to a standard 32-hour week with no drop in pay.They hope this would kickstart efforts to reduce working time across the rest of the economy, creating even more jobs in the private sector.Such a move would be popular with the public. A recent Survation poll found that two-thirds of people in the UK support the idea, with 57% of Conservative voters saying they either strongly or somewhat support a reduced working week.More surprisingly, 64% of business people surveyed in September 2019 backed the idea, rising to 73% in larger businesses which employ more than 500 staff.July 2020 Survation polling on the four-day week, commissioned by Autonomy.Autonomy say that now is the time for the public sector - which accounts for almost 17% of employment across the UK - to pioneer working time reduction.\"With a 32-hour week in public organisations, this policy would create a new gold standard that the private sector can follow,\" said Stronge.\"Northern areas such as Doncaster, Sheffield, Liverpool and Blackpool all have relatively high rates of public sector employment, so this could be a gamechanger for those working populations.\"The pandemic has accelerated political interest in the idea, with the 4 Day Week Campaign attracting support from MPs across the Commons including Clive Lewis, Caroline Lucas and Mhairi Black.I'm pretty sure everyone would be less stressed if they had a five-day salary and four days of workRick, a public sector worker in Sheffield, told Now Then that switching to a four-day week had made him feel \"less tired in general.\"\"I did it for quality of life reasons, as I like the freedom and flexibility of three-day weekends, and it's a much better balance than working full time and trying to pack everything into a two-day weekend,\" he said.\"I've had to sacrifice a bit of a pay cut to allow me to do that, but I value that extra free time over having slightly more money, and don't mind being slightly frugal in some areas in exchange. I'm pretty sure everyone would be less stressed if they had a five-day salary and four days of work.\"Learn moreRead Autonomy's report.Find out more about the 4 Day Week Campaign.Shareby Sam GregoryFollow @SamMGreg on TwitterFiled under: #Four-day weekMore Sheffield NewsRed Deer falls victim to third lockdown as pubs struggle across SheffieldThursdayThe manager of a city-centre institution has handed in his notice, citing \"incredibly difficult trading conditions\" caused by the pandemic.Consultation opens on future budget as Council Tax set to rise by nearly 4%2 days agoCouncillors have called on the government to reverse a decade of cuts and fund essential services properly.Covid testing centres in Sheffield 'open seven days a week'1 week agoSheffield's six testing centres at Meadowhall, Sharrow, Darnall, Burngreave and Upperthorpe are operational, with Hillsborough centre moving to site of former Hazlebarrow Primary School from Monday.Rebuilding Sheffield's economy from coronavirus a \"herculean task\"1 week agoMayor warns against a \"a slow and steady return to a broken status quo,\" as thousands of children are set to go off school without access to laptops.Join us as a Now Then Community Correspondent4 weeks agoWe’re looking for someone to report on their chosen community in Sheffield, whether that’s a geographic neighbourhood or a community of interest, identity or faith - or something else completely.More Sheffield News	Return to homepageIndependent, high-quality citizen journalism since 2008.About UsShopContact UsComplaintsTerms & ConditionsCookie PolicyPrivacy PolicyFacebookTwitterInstagramRSSReturn to top"
