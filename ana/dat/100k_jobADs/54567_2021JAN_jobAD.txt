This afternoon, I got an email scheduling a panel interview for Mayport FL.The same thing happened to me when I was going through the NCIS process. I received a not referred and later had my panel interview in Mayport as well. Don't trust USAJOB updates, the position and agency I am working in now was updated to not hired a month after I accepted the position!CommentPostCanceldosumthingForum MemberJoin Date: Jun 2013Posts: 21ShareTweet#168401-30-2015, 04:37 PMI wish you luck my friend.

I really dont know what they are looking for... As I said, good luck and I hope someone gets it.Brother I am also a former Marine, State Law Enforcement, OCONUS Security Contractor and I am currently a gov employee with a Master's degree. I have been through the NCIS board, poly, medical, BI and now my packet is supposed to be with the hiring board as we speak. I was told I would be updated by the end of this month after the board met this past week to consider applicants for the March 2015 class. It has been a long week and I have heard nothing. I feel everyone's pain that has been through this process and I wish luck to anyone still in it.CommentPostCanceldsb05cForum MemberJoin Date: Mar 2014Posts: 341ShareTweet#168601-30-2015, 05:01 PMI'm not sure I'll move forward but I'll continue as I am also processing for another 1811 gig with a diff agency and have yet to take the poly on that. Current Fed (6 years) in 6c covered position. Master's degree but not a vet. 3 hour drive to Jville but I'll see what happen .CommentPostCancelMFUSMA10Forum MemberJoin Date: May 2014Posts: 3ShareTweet#168701-30-2015, 05:37 PMAll,I was in a similar situation as a few of you here. I received the moving forward email and then BQA following it. I got in contact with an SSA at NCIS for confirmation and got a quick response saying \"Please disregard the email. There was an error with the system. You are still in the process. We are currently preparing schedules for interviews. Thanks for your continued interest in the NCIS.\"I don't want to get anyone's hopes up but I figured it was worth putting it out there so you can actually get some sleep this weekend.Good luck to all.RLTW-MCommentPostCancelPHSeaBeeForum MemberJoin Date: Oct 2010Posts: 562ShareTweet#168801-31-2015, 06:13 PMOriginally posted by Olive Drab View PostVet, Current Special Agent, and got that email. hopefully this is a glitch10pt Vet, prior Local LE, current Fed LE and crim just degree.

The \"at this time\" means you may be in the next round of those selected. When you apply for These positions. A \" you were not referred\" or a \" disqualified\" are bad letters. I want those getting this letter to realize they didn't make this cut. But there will be other cuts. Over inflated applications , failed polys and PT Yes. I say \" not referred at this time \" is still good. This is a very competitive career. If you are the lucky one who just applies and gets hired. Good got you but most of us struggle to get that dream jobCommentPostCancelRed_BeardForum MemberJoin Date: Jan 2015Posts: 7ShareTweet#169302-02-2015, 06:58 PMFor those of you that have finalized hiring packets that have been sent to the hiring board for review, FYI.. I was notified today that my packet is up for review this Friday and that HR is expected to have the results no later than Tuesday after the hiring board has made their decision. Good luck to all!CommentPostCancelViking14Forum MemberJoin Date: Nov 2014Posts: 208ShareTweet#169402-03-2015, 11:24 AMHere is a good one for everyone receiving the DQ letter time and time again from NCIS....I received my 3rd or 4th DQ letter a couple of weeks ago, so I emailed and asked how I was not referred (only because of the crazy stories of people getting conflicting answers). They emailed back saying they actually have me on the referred certificate.Who knows what the heck they are doin over there?!CommentPostCancelTheDamonFactorFreedom FighterJoin Date: Aug 2014Posts: 451ShareTweet#169502-03-2015, 11:32 AMGuess you will find out when someone calls you for an interview.TDFCommentPostCancelPrevious 1 13 63 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 163 213 241 template NextMR300x250 TabletCollapseWhat's Going OnCollapseThere are currently 6517 users online. 352 members and 6165 guests.Most users ever online was 158,966 at 05:57 AM on 01-16-2021.Tag CloudCollapseacademy advice background investigation california corrections employment florida hiring hiring process holster interview lapd law enforcement new york nypd police sheriff texas training trooperWelcome AdCollapseCool Blue- Cool BlueDefault vB5 StyleEnglish (US)Deutsch (Du)English (US)FrenchSpanishHelpContact UsFire House ForumsSecurity Info Watch ForumsGo to topCopyright 1996-2017, Officer.com, Southcomm Business Media - Public Safety InteractivePowered by vBulletin® Version 5.6.4Copyright © 2021 vBulletin Solutions, Inc.
