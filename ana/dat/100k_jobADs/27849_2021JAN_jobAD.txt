As a result, companies are scrambling to find ways to analyze and apply this data to increase their profits, target new markets and boost productivity levels. So, if you are looking for a job in high demand that also pays a good salary, consider pursuing a career as a data scientist.Many companies are looking for data scientists to figure out how to process treasure troves of information. For example, according to McKinsey & Company, a retail company that leverages big data to its fullest potential could increase its operation margin by more than 60 percent. If the health care sector used data to become more efficient and operate at a higher level of quality, it could generate more than $300 billion in value yearly and reduce expenditures by 8 percent. Companies that use personal-location data could tap into an extra $600 billion in consumer purchases and services.However, McKinsey & Company projects that by 2018 there will be a shortage of anywhere from 140,000 to 180,000 individuals who have the type of in-depth analytical skills needed to be data scientists in the United States. Management positions are even scarcer. McKinsey predicts that the country will need 1.5 million managers and analysts who can make decisions based on big data.According to Forbes, a Robert Half Technology survey of 1,400 American chief information officers revealed that more than half of the companies collecting big data were not leveraging it because they did not have the necessary staff to access, assess and communicate knowledge gleaned from the data.Job Demand Produces a Top-10 JobGlassdoor lists data scientist as one of the 25 best jobs in America for 2015.

Burtch Works’ 2014 analysis of data scientists’ salaries places the median salary for data scientists with little experience at $80,000. Individuals with nine or more years of experience could earn up to $150,000. At the managerial level, data scientists who oversee a team of one to three people earn $140,000, and those who manage 10 or more team members earn $232,500.Prepare for a Career in Data ScienceIf you’re ready to pursue a red-hot career as a data scientist, consider earning an advanced degree in data science.
