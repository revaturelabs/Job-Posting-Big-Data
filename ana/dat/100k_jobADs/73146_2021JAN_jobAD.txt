"Non-Clinical Physician Jobs, Careers, and Opportunities: Angry reactions about the eBay docPagesHomeGetting StartedJoinAboutContactFriday, October 9, 2009Angry reactions about the eBay docMy blog gets syndicated through several different channels, and one of them happens to be the Trusted.MD network. After I wrote about the CNN story about the physician Dr. Jennifer Lickteig who makes more money selling items on eBay than in seeing patients (\"Doc makes more cash selling clothes on eBay\"), I received an onslaught of comments from people who must not have been satisfied with their eBay transactions with her. These comments could have been generated by only a few (or even a single) user - I have no way of knowing that. Some of the comments claim that she uses several different eBay user IDs. I tried to look up a few of them and nothing came up. So, I'm inclined to think that those comments may have been generated by a single angry customer.In any case, I was trying to focus on the principle behind the story, not the actual story. The principle is that many physicians are looking for supplemental income because their day job isn't enough. They may find non-clinical jobs in the world of medical writing, sales, consulting, teaching, etc. Some are obviously more successful than others, but it's always interesting to meet physicians who have an entrepreneurial spirit. You can leverage common resources like eBay to build a business if you're creative and if you have the right business sense.As for Dr. Jennifer Lickteig, I know nothing about her eBay activity beyond what's described in the CNN story. I've never purchased anything from her. I don't even know her eBay userID.Posted by Unknown at 11:15 PMEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels: CNN, eBayNo comments:Post a CommentNewer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)Sign up for e-mail updatesEnter your email address:Search this siteNon-Clinical Medical Jobs, Careers, and Opportunities for PhysiciansPopular PostsJob post (updated link): IRB Medical Board ChairJob post (updated link): IRB Medical Board Chair The link to this position can be found here: https://careers.wcgclinical.com/careers/Fo...Master in Clinical Service Operations (MCSO)Harvard Medical School offers a program called the Master in Clinical Service Operations (MCSO).
