Here are six tips to help you manage weeds in and around your flower beds and shrubbery.1. Don't over digDig only where you need to, excessive digging causes weed seeds to be brought closer to the surface so they can get enough light to trigger germination.2. Lay down mulchMulch can block weed seeds from getting the light they need to grow and spread. Covering your soil's surface with mulch can act as a protective layer to keep weeds away.3. Pick the right toolsAlways ensure that you choose the best environment to dig up weeds. When the ground is wet, use hand tools; when the ground is dry, slice off the top of the weed to starve the root.4. Chop heads offIf you can't fully remove the weed, chopping off its head is the next best thing. This reduces the weed's ability to reseed and limits the food supply to the root.5. Plant closely togetherMinding the gaps between plants can help reduce the amount of light exposure to the soil surface. Planting closely together creates shade, reducing the chance of weed germination.6. Deprive weeds of waterAim to deprive weeds of water by placing a drip or a soaker beneath mulch, this will reduce seeds being able to germinate.Best tools for weedingWith these top tools, you can stop weeds from spreading and taking over your garden.ScarifiersScarifiers are designed to cut through to the soil, simplifying the tidying up of a garden by removing dead moss and other debris such as grass cuttings and leaves.Shop scarifiersLong-handled toolsSpades, forks and rakes are great tools when used on their own, or as a combination.

As with all chemical-based products, it’s important to read the label and follow the manufacturer's instructions before using weed killer in your garden. Some weed killers will also remain in the soil for a period of time after application, so it's best not to replant in the area straight away.More garden inspirationAdvice, features and design tips to help you transform your garden.Create the perfect garden lawnGive your lawn the TLC it deserves.How to save water in your gardenTools and tips to help you save water.Learn how to make compostMake nutrient-rich compost from your garden waste.Why buy at Argos?Enjoy now, pay later with the Argos Card.
