Surprisingly, most of them aren’t aware of all the rights they have regarding medical care and other benefits. Doing specific things if you’re hurt on the job can help protect those rights.File a ReportAs soon as you are able, file a report of the injury with your work supervisor. Even if you don’t think your injuries are serious, you still must report it. Sometimes minor injuries grow into more serious ones.The written report you file should contain all the pertinent details of the event. Your name, contact information, workplace information and the events leading up to the accident need to be included in this report. Ensure that you receive a copy of it and that you file it somewhere that you can easily access it should you need to do so at a later date.Seek Medical AttentionIt’s important that you seek medical attention for any on-the-job injury you’ve experienced — no matter how small or minor you might think it is. When you arrive at the medical facility, be sure to inform the staff that your injuries occurred while you were working.Take PicturesWhen it comes to documenting the circumstances surrounding your workplace accident, pictures can lend a visual element that a written report might lack. Make sure that you get a picture of the area of your workplace where you were injured, the places on your body that were injured and any items or extenuating circumstances, if applicable.Talk to WitnessesUnless you work in a very small company, it’s likely that there were witnesses to your injuries. Get these witness statements as soon as possible after the event so that memories are still fresh.Contact an Experienced LawyerOnly an experienced Florida worker’s compensation lawyer like the ones at Accident Lawyer John Fagan can protect your rights objectively and thoroughly when it comes to being injured on the job.

When we started the process we never got explained step by step how will work. We expected more communication from the person in charge of the case in our case was Adrianne, She never answered a call and when I sent emails I did not get an answer on time, most of the time it took more than 48 hours for her to respond and I was not pleased with the answer of my question (leaving me with doubts about what I was asking) when the case of property damage part was finally over with her, the case goes on demand for the insurer which never I saw some copy but I have to clarify that Mrs Daphne nail was very kind.read moreKristen Rosepiler22:41 19 Oct 18First off, if I could give Daphne ZERO stars, I would. She was terrible with communication! She could never accept a... phone call, I always had to leave messages that she never returned, and didn't even call me on SCHEDULED conference calls. The three stars is only because of my beginning experiences..... My case was transferred to Adrienne, if you have a case here, REQUEST HER. She was such a breath of fresh air. She kept me updated via email about everything. I understand that a lot of phone tag happens during these cases, but she kept me updated on everything. Not a week went by that she didn't tell me what was going on. She fought very hard for me to get my bills and med pay down so that my settlement was better. In the end, she turned an awful experience into a good one. She definitely deserves 5 stars!! Thanks!read moreChaos with the Christopher's13:07 09 Oct 18I don't reccomend this attorney at all. They drug my case out for 6 years. I went 8m without them contacting me. They... aren't genuinely for you. I was told that my case wasn't putting any money in their pockets. That's when I knew I had to fire them. 6 years too long! I reccomend Byrd & Byrd!read moreRand Peterson17:26 28 Aug 17John Fagan did an exceptional job in dealing with my accident claim.
