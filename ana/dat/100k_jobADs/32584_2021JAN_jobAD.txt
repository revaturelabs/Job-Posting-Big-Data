The reasons vary from not trusting the director to actors thinking they know more than they do or think they can do more than most humans without compromising their performances.Side By Side Interview – David Fincher (2012)So who is right? It depends on who can recognize the right performance required for the scene as it relates to the story and ultimately movie. Ideally, everyone in the production should be able to do this (be happy if everyone in the scene gets it), but that’s very rare and when it does, it’s usually over the top or cliche’. Be careful! Make choices that are justifiable on as many levels as possible and you’ll usually be on the right track.If someone’s justification doesn’t exist or is based on external (non-movie related) reasoning, hopefully they’ll realize what they’re saying is not best for the production and you can move on.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdOiq1m0qNk&feature=player_embeddedAuthor Ben ChiuPosted on August 1, 2012 April 16, 2019 Categories Production	Leave a Reply Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment.Post navigationPrevious Previous post: There’s passion, and there is PASSION!!Next Next post: Video Essay: Kubrick & One-Point PerspectiveSearch for:SearchMenuRegisterLog inEntries feedComments feedRecent PostsWhy Virtual Reality Could Generate $150 Billion for Hollywood By 2020One of those days 2 – Candide ThovexHow ‘Ebert’ are you?Your brain on movies: Why films make us cry, flinch and cheerSummer movies 2014: 5 things we learnedRecent CommentsMindScans Teaser #2CategoriesMovie BusinessProductionWebsiteArchivesJune 2015January 2015November 2014September 2014April 2014March 2014February 2014December 2013October 2013July 2013April 2013March 2013January 2013September 2012August 2012July 2012January 2012AboutAbout BenBen on IMDbBen/s Old Web SiteFor fun – Ben in the MediaAlliance Digital EntertainmentMindScansAlliance Digital StudiosStudio StoreForums© Copyright 1992 - 2021	BenChiu.com Proudly powered by Alliance Digital Studios"
