So we are taking ourselves and our three unreliable cars on probably the longest journey of our lives in an effort to change just one.We will be taking on and working on the cars in a massive temperature change as we go round from the cold of Canada to the baking sun of southern USA. Not to mention the frustration and challenges the cars will throw at us.We are totally relying on an enthusiasts knowledge of cars and mechanics and the generosity and helpful nature of the people we meet along the way.Please support The American JobBack to newsSite linksUseful ResourcesFAQsPoliciesForms – Expense Claim & Fundraising FormsFundraising PromiseOtherTerms of UseCookie PolicyPrivacy PolicyCompany No 08184807Charity No 1149254And registered as a charity in Scotland No SCO42611.Registered Office is at Salford House, Salford Terrace, 19-21 Quarry Hill Road, Tonbridge, Kent, TN9 2RN.Site by MCM NetRequest a callbackIf you are a human and are seeing this field, please leave it blank.
