Remember, you are selling yourself, and the initial email or letter is the first impression your potential employer will have of you… so, it needs to be good!The first thing you need to consider before sending your application is whether your CV is good enough. It is important to make sure your CV has all the correct information and is set out right. If you are unsure, pop onto the internet and search for some examples. Also, remember to put all of the relevant information on your CV, which you can cater towards specific jobs. If the job calls for extensive cooking experience, then make sure you highlight your cooking experience in your CV.Secondly, employers receive hundreds of applications, so make sure that your reply to any advert is personalised with a greeting and some information about yourself. Employers can tell when candidates have not read the job spec properly. Apply for jobs that you are suitable for, and tell the client or agency WHY you are suitable.Finally, always make sure YOUR contact information is correct. Often, we will receive CVs from potentially wonderful candidates, who have listed an incorrect telephone number. Check and double check your phone number and email address before sending your application.Good luck and happy job hunting!Tags: job5 tips for a brilliant CVSearch for:Recent PostChildren’s Mental Health January 27, 2021Mindfulness in Early Years January 11, 2021Developing Imaginative and Creative Play Opportunities January 11, 2021Emotional Literacy in Early Years January 11, 2021Effects of exercise on memory and learning October 20, 2020Upcoming EventsFirst Aid Course - 30th Jan 2021Emergency Paediatric First Aid CourseJanuary 30, 20219:45 am - 3:45 pmSleep Practitioner Programme | January 2021 intakeTeaching session 4January 30, 202110:00 am - 12:00 pmSleep practitioner programme starting 9th January 2021, running weekly on Saturdays at 10am.Starting Solids | 30th January 202130th January 2021January 30, 202112:00 pm - 3:00 pmThis workshop will take you through all you need to know about weaning, working with babies aged 4-12 months and their families.
