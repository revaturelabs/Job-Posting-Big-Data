After meeting with our staff she immediately decided to register with us to find a job.Cindy has recently completed high school and but felt she had received limited support while at school about what her options would be to enter into the workforce and said of her experience “Before I signed up with Ability Options, I was lost and didn’t have anything to look forward to but now a new door is wide open for me, and I feel motivated and nothing is stopping me now!”We listened to Cindy as she identified her employment goals as well as what she felt her strengths and support needs would be to keep that job.She said she always wanted to work in Retail/Customer service so with our support around travel training, and after some specific coaching, a pharmacy Assistant role with Moorebank Pharmacy was organised for Cindy. “My mum is very happy and can’t believe that I have a job now!”Cindy’s Manager at the pharmacy, Owen has been very patient and inclusive of Cindy and is happy to have us support Cindy’s to ensure she has the every possibility to make her dream role work for her and her new employer. “I am very hopeful for my future. People who have disability shouldn’t give up and we all learn different ways.”“I want to be a role model for my younger sister and show her that it is possible to be independent even when you have disability.” said Cindy.Congratulations Cindy!Contact Olympus SolutionsWant to know more about us?
