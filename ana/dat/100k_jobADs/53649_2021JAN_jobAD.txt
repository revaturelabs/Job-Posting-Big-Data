Cloud is such an app. When installed on your Mac, it automatically uploads screenshots to your web storage. This is great if you are working on client work or collaborating and want a way to share images with people quickly, without cluttering up your email. But there’s more to Cloud than that. Its got the kind of functionality that makes it fast and easy to upload music tracks, videos and links (with shortened URLs) quickly with the Raindrop plug-ins in the preferences. Give it a try and let me know what you think.(via CloudApp)Share via:TwitterFacebookLinkedInTumblrPinterestRedditEmailLike this:Like Loading...You might also enjoy:Tags: app, digitalShare:TwitterFacebookGoogle+Written by AnaPost navigationPrevious PostNext PostLeave a Reply Cancel replyCommentNameEmailWebsite (optional)Notify me of follow-up comments by email.Notify me of new posts by email.This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
