With the national unemployment rate holding[COLUMN_BREAK]above 9 percent for five straight months and not expected to drop by any significant measure in the foreseeable future, the state of the labor market is one of the biggest obstacles for struggling homeowners and their lenders.A number of programs at both the national and state level have been launched to assist unemployed homeowners, but so far the expected results haven't materialized.HUD \"\"has told DSNews.com\"\":http://dsnews.comarticles/ehlp-falls-short-of-its-goal-2011-09-27 that it does not expect to meet the original goal set for the $1 billion Emergency Homeowners Loan Program (EHLP) of subsidizing 30,000 unemployed homeownersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mortgage payments.The _New York Times_ reports that fewer than 15,000 borrowers are likely to receive EHLP assistance and more than half of the money allotted for the program will go unspent.An analysis of government records \"\"by _USA Today_ shows\"\":http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/story/2011-09-18/real-estate-fund-foreclosure-help-lags/50458568/1 that a separate federal program which provides money to individual states to assist homeowners whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve lost their jobs has been slow in ramping up.Through the TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hardest Hit Fund, 18 states were awarded a total of $7.6 billion to develop their own localized programs to counter unemployment and falling home prices in the fight against foreclosure._USA Today_ says only about 1 percent of this money has actually been distributed to distressed homeowners, 16 months after the program was launched.The news agency found that as of June 30th, 17 states had used the federal funds to help about 7,500 homeowners._USA Today_ noted that several states are just now getting their individual programs off the ground and dispersing the money to qualified applicants. The states have until 2017 to use their allotted funds.Delinquency Rate Foreclosure Prevention	2011-09-30Carrie BaytweetShareTagged with: Delinquency Rate Foreclosure PreventionPrevious: States Can Learn from New England’s Foreclosure Prevention ProgramsNext: Former Countrywide Employee Behind BarsAbout Author: Carrie BayCarrie Bay is a freelance writer for DS News and its sister publication MReport.
