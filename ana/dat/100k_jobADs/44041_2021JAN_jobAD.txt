It is not a book about Job or about suffering but about the character and nature of God. God’s statement to Eliphaz, “…you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has,” should stir up serious and confusing questions in your mind, for on the surface it appears Job’s friends spoke right about God and Job didn’t. But God said the exact opposite was true. Why? What did Job’s friends say that was wrong and Job say that was right about God? I’ve studied this and have a plethora of notes that I hope someday to organize and post. (The first two parts have already been posted.)Take time to study this for yourself and see how far down the rabbit hole you go.Posted in Bible Study	Tagged writings	permalinkPost navigation← Victory Over Sin ContestProfitable Servants →CommentsThe Key To Understanding Job — No Comments	Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
