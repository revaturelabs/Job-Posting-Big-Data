Photographer: Liam Kidston.The Motor Trades Association of Queensland (MTAQ) believes about 780 staff across the state's dealers will be affected.Holden owners have been assured all warranties and servicing offers will remain and General Motors has pledged to provide servicing and spare parts for at least 10 years through national aftersales networks.Holden's Australian leadership team presented a business case to General Motors' executives, who decided the investment in future Holden models would not generate a significant return.\"After comprehensive assessment, we regret that we could not prioritise the investment required for Holden to be successful for the long term in Australia and New Zealand, over all other considerations we have globally,\" General Motors' International Operations Senior Vice President Julian Blissett said.\"It's tough to support a brand and a business that operates in just two markets.\"This was an agonising decision for us and one we didn't make lightly or easily.\"General Motors says the move will cost more than US$1 billion.Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday voiced his anger over General Motors taking billions of dollars in government subsidies only to let the Holden brand die and then walk away from the Australian market.GM Holden interim chairman and managing director Kristian Aquailina (left) and GM international operations Senior Vice President Julian Blissett address the media in Melbourne. (AAP Image/James Ross)\"They took money from Australian taxpayers for all those years just to let the Holden brand wither on their watch - that's disappointing,\" he said.Holden started as a saddlery in Adelaide in 1856 and moved into building vehicle bodies before it was purchased by General Motors in 1931.In 1948 the first Australian-made Holden car was launched in Port Melbourne, which Prime Minister Ben Chifley declared \"a beauty\".It was the first of 7.6 million cars sold over the next 72 years as Holden became embedded into the fabric of Australia.The retirement of the brand yesterday came less than three years after the last Australian-made Commodore V8 rolled off the Adelaide production line.Sales of the Commodore, considered the heartbeat of the brand, fell from 200,000 annual sales in the mid-2000s to just 5915 last year.In 2019 Holden posted its lowest annual sales since 1954.HSV W427 with race driver Mark Skaife in 2008. Picture: Joshua Dowling.MTAQ CEO Brett Dale said the death of Holden was a shock, but not unpredictable.\"Holden never really understood the Australian market once they took the Commodore offshore after 2017,\" he said.\"We didn't see a long future but this closure is certainly sooner than I thought.\"Dr Dale said Queensland dealerships were eagerly waiting to see the detail about Holden's compensation package, with most unable to swap manufacturers when Holden closes.AP Eagers has partnered with General Motors since 1930, 18 years prior to Holden's launch in Australia.AP Eagers CEO Martin Ward said it was a \"very sad day for our company\" who have diligently represented the Holden brand.\"General Motors has indicated that it intends to outline proposed transition and compensationarrangements with each dealer on a confidential basis and that these arrangements will be fair,\" he said.He said AP Eagers would assess the financial effect on the company once further details were received from General Motors.More StoriesPremium Content Driver ‘ran red light’: Man killed in rolling car‘I am angry’: PM slams Holden exit after $2b handoutHuge clues behind Holden bombshellPremium Content Holden to quit AustraliaWhat Holden disappearance means for ownersPremium Content State of Origin for sale after death of an iconPremium Content ‘You’re not taking the Kingswood!’Premium Content Holden: The rise and fall of an Australian iconPremium Content Holden’s greatest TV ads of all timePremium Content Numbers spell big trouble for building industryPremium Content Holden’s Australia closure explained: What it means‘Won’t take long’: Holden’s big clear outShow MoreHeadlinesPremium Content Disabled child blocked twice from flying with airline23rd Jan 2021 2:02 PM1Why Australia Day could be on May 26business cars editors picks holden jobs manufacturing motoringMore StoriesPremium Content Driver ‘ran red light’: Man killed in rolling car‘I am angry’: PM slams Holden exit after $2b handoutHuge clues behind Holden bombshellPremium Content Holden to quit AustraliaWhat Holden disappearance means for ownersPremium Content State of Origin for sale after death of an iconPremium Content ‘You’re not taking the Kingswood!’Premium Content Holden: The rise and fall of an Australian iconPremium Content Holden’s greatest TV ads of all timePremium Content Numbers spell big trouble for building industryPremium Content Holden’s Australia closure explained: What it means‘Won’t take long’: Holden’s big clear outShow MoreSubscriber ExclusivesPremium Content Man charged over samurai sword threatsCrime A man allegedly threatened a household of people with a samurai sword in a bizarre...23rd Jan 2021 2:51 PMPremium Content Inmates put their kids on the path to successNews Female prisoners provide their kids with essential back to school gear23rd Jan 2021 2:23 PMPremium Content Fruit pickers’ scarcity bites, leads to island ‘bubble’ pushBusiness Susan McDonald renews calls for Pacific Island travel bubble as rotting fruit bill...23rd Jan 2021 1:51 PM1Premium Content Report finds soiled bandages not changed for nine daysHealth Bolton Clarke Rowes Bay aged care audit finds shocking flaws1Premium Content New video raises query about death of much-loved crocNews There are theories one of the Far North’s favourite saltwater crocs – thought to...Premium Content New warning for Aussie universities’ China tiesPolitics Unis need government approval before China agreements: inquiryTop StoriesPremium Content Pomona motorbike crash sends one person to Coast hospitalNews The crash follows another at Woolooga earlier this morning.Teen stabbed at train stationPremium Content Man hacked into sister’s bank account, stole safeMargaret Court pleads for critics to stopPM under fire over stranded Aussies1Contact Full Site TopDigital AdvertisingAdvertising TermsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseView our other news sitesDaily NewspapersBundaberg News-MailFraser Coast ChronicleGladstone ObserverGrafton Daily ExaminerGympie TimesIpswich Queensland TimesLismore Northern StarMackay Daily MercuryRockhampton Morning BulletinSunshine Coast DailyToowoomba ChronicleWarwick Daily NewsCommunity NewspapersBig RigsBallina Shire AdvocateBalonne BeaconBlackwater HeraldCentral & North Burnett TimesBiloela Central TelegraphByron Shire NewsCaboolture NewsChinchilla NewsCoffs Coast AdvocateCoolum & North Shore NewsDalby HeraldEast-Ipswich SatelliteEmerald Central Queensland NewsGatton StarIpswich AdvertiserIsis Town and CountryLogan ReporterNoosa NewsThe Northern Rivers EchoRange NewsRural WeeklySouth Burnett TimesStanthorpe Border PostSuratBasin.com.auTweed Daily NewsCharleville Western TimesRoma Western StarWhitsunday TimesWhitsunday Coast Guardian© Gympie Times Pty Ltd 2021.
