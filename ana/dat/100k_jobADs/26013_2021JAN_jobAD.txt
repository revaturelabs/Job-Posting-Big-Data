It is not about fancy visuals and PowerPoint presentations, or hard-core sales pitches. What really counts is making an authentic connection with other people that comes from the heart.In Speak from the Heart, Emmy Award-winning broadcaster, newspaper columnist, and motivational speaker Steve Adubato reveals the secrets to being a great communicator -- with a program that will dramatically change the way you talk, listen, and connect with others.Steve Adubato's life experiences, both professional and as a husband, son, brother, and father, have taught him invaluable lessons about the power of personal, sincere communication. In Speak from the Heart, he demonstrates that being a truly great communicator is not simply about being articulate or being a \"good talker.\" It is not about fancy visuals and PowerPoint presentations, or hard-core sales pitches, or even who has the most facts, figures, and technical wizardry. What really counts is making an authentic connection with other people that comes not merely from the intellect but from the heart.If you want to make a lasting impact, Dr. Adubato shows you how to engage people through empathy and understanding, how to be a great listener, and how to make an audience -- whether one, one hundred, or one thousand people -- care about you and your message. He helps you to rely less on written speeches, teleprompters, and index cards full of too much forgettable information, and learn, instead, how to tell a compelling story and create excitement and enthusiasm. You will learn, for example, how to:Lecture less and engage moreCommunicate under pressureMake effective use of eye contactDevelop a conversational styleInspire in a human, personal wayBecome comfortable with your core messageSpeak from the Heart will not only make it easier for you to communicate your message without being ignored or misunderstood; it will also improve your relationships with other people and help you to become more productive at work -- with more satisfaction and less stress.

What is my message? (This is the one thing you want people toremember when you finish.)2. Who is my audience? (What will move them? Touch them? Reachthem? What do they need or want from me?)3. What do I want these people to do or feel when I'm finished?I also liked the \"Do It Now\" activities at the end of each chapter . . . thisone, in particular, caught my attention:* How well do you use eye contact? Starting today, notice if you look directlyinto the eyeballs of the people you communicate with. If you find you have aproblem doing this consider these pointers:1. Start small and slowly. Practice making eye contact for a few seconds ata time. Just make contact for a few seconds and then discreetly move toanother part of the face-lower forehead or bridge of nose. You can alsolook down, but only for a second or two. Then look back up and engage theeyes again.2. Relax. Consistent, steady eye contact doesn't mean you stare at aperson throughout the entire conversation. You need to make easy,relaxed contact for a short while and then allow your glance to comfortablylook away and then come back.3. Smile. Just the simple act of smiling while speaking can make eye contactmore relaxed and easier for you. Let your face show how you feel.4. Increase the amount of time you make eye contact. Little by little it willbecome less of an issue, less of an obstacle, less of a barrier. The key isfor eye contact to become second nature to you. That takes practice.5. Concentrate. You have to give the person you're talking to your fullattention. If another person walks by who may be more \"interesting\" youmust make yourself focus on the person you're talking to and maintain eyecontact. Nothing is worse than talking to someone while your eyes are playingthe field. Finish your conversation with one person before you move on to thenext.And one other thing that made this book a winner for me was Abudato'suse of real examples . . . he not only used himself, but also theexperiences of such speakers as Barry Farber, Richard Carlson, BillClinton (before he became a great speaker), Kathie Lee Gifford, andJoe Torre, to name just a few.The book's subtitle says it all . . . Abudato urges you to BE YOURSELFAND GET RESULTS . . . read what he has to say, and you should be ableto do just that.AnyshounThis book is easy to read. It contains stories that are interesting. Provides simple guidelines to becoming a better communicator. Near the end of the book, there's even a chapter that provides insight to why men think differently from women.HanadAs a professional speaker, I long ago learned the secret of \"speaking from the heart.\" And, most of the better books on public speaking do in fact make this among their most important points. But, by using this critical point as his book title, Steve Adubato has brought this important concept front and center. Loud and clear!One of the things I liked most about this book was its excellent organization. The author connects with his great title by devoting the first part of the book to \"Communicating with Passion.\" Then, the author drills down on the specific skills that support ones ability to speak with passion.In an age where so many books are not well organized and therefore tax the reader with developing ones own analytical framework for the subject, this book lays out a sound framework for being a great communicator. The framework is then well supported by both theory, and anecdotes that serve to effectively drive home the learning point.At the risk of being picky, my sole disappointment is that the author acknowledges some leading self improvement greats (e.g., Dyer, Robbins, et al) as among the very best speakers, but regretfully never shares what he thinks makes each of them such a standout. Is the only learning point from these greats that they speak from the heart? Personally, I believe each of those listed draws on many of the other points made by Adubato. Given the authors clear expertise, I would have benefited even more had he shared his insights into what makes those he learned from so great.MMMMmmmm...so Steve, is that the sequel? \"Speakers from the Heart\"?? I am ready to preorder that gem.eBooks related to Speak from the Heart: Be Yourself and Get ResultsA Mother's Heart, A Daughter's Love: Poems for Us to Share ebookA Mother's Heart, A Daughter's Love: Poems for Us to Share ebookFor ChildrenFrom the Father's Heart: A Glimpse of God's Nature and Ways ebookFrom the Father's Heart: A Glimpse of God's Nature and Ways ebookChristians and BiblesThe Heart Rate Monitor Log Book for Outdoor or Indoor: A Heart Zone Training Program (Heart Zone Training Program Series) ebookThe Heart Rate Monitor Log Book for Outdoor or Indoor: A Heart Zone Training Program (Heart Zone Training Program Series) ebookSport booksHeart Fitness for Life: The Essential Guide for Preventing and Reversing Heart Disease ebookHeart Fitness for Life: The Essential Guide for Preventing and Reversing Heart Disease ebookOtherWinning Habits: 4 Secrets That Will Change the Rest of Your Life ebookWinning Habits: 4 Secrets That Will Change the Rest of Your Life ebookMoneymakingOddest Yet: Even More Stories to Chill the Heart (Bram Stoker Award for Young Readers) ebookOddest Yet: Even More Stories to Chill the Heart (Bram Stoker Award for Young Readers) ebookFor ChildrenGodzilla Doesnt Speak (Chinese Edition) ebookGodzilla Doesnt Speak (Chinese Edition) ebookFor ChildrenSeven Secrets of Confidence ebookSeven Secrets of Confidence ebookSelf-HelpListen Son-12 Heart to Heart Talks ebookListen Son-12 Heart to Heart Talks ebookChristians and Bibles2007 Spring list: Power Points!: How to Design and Deliver Presentations That Sizzle and Sell ebook2007 Spring list: Power Points!: How to Design and Deliver Presentations That Sizzle and Sell ebookITContactsPrivacy PolicyDMCA© 2018-2020 lebaronparis.fr All rights reservedWhat do you want to read?eBooksITEngineeringMoneymakingHistoryFor ChildrenGraphic Novels and ComicsHobbies and CraftsPhoto and ArtHealth and FitnessCookbooksCalendarsEducationFantasySpiritualityGays and LesbiansHumorChristians and BiblesRomanceMemoris and BiographiesLawSelf-HelpFictionTeen and YoungMedical BooksTravelMystery and SuspenseRelationshipsReferenceScienceSport booksPoliticsTest PreparationNo categoryOther"
