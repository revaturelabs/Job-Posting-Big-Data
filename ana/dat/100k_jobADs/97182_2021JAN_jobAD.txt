Our men and women in the armed forces are uniquely positioned with the knowledge and drive to succeed, but may lack certain industry qualifications.”According to the release by OSTP, the program is designed to help address the shortage of skilled jobs for returning veterans while meeting the wireless industry’s need for skilled tower-climbers to quickly, efficiently and safely deploy wireless telecommunications equipment and facilities.The Warriors 4 Wireless pilot program was launched nearly a year ago in Washington, D.C. It saw an 86 percent placement rate for the more than 50 participating veterans.Back in April, the Veterans IT Training and Certification program launched at the White House on the heels of President Barack Obama’s call to action for veterans to have better access to receive civilian training and certifications.“It’s a win for the increasing number of Americans across our nation who rely on wireless networks at work and at home, and the exciting new opportunities that these networks are helping create in health care, education and every corner of our economy,” Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler said.-In this Story-Government IT News, Tech, White House, workforceRelated newsTechPresident Biden taps...by Billy Mitchell • 4 hours agoAcquisitionAgencies told to assess...by Dave Nyczepir • 1 day agoTechDHS sued over social...by Dave Nyczepir • 1 day agoAboutSponsorRSS© 2021 Scoop News Group | All Rights ReservedSearch for:The best federal IT news, delivered straight to your inbox.
