Whether you are the one who will be appraising or being appraised, each word that you say or hear has significance. Most of the time, there is a fear associated with these discussions- that stems from unclarity of purpose, conflicting perspectives, unknowns, uncomfortable comparisons, feeling small or inadequate, etc.Judith Glaser says, “Words create worlds”. What you choose to say and how you say it will all matter. Do take care of the following-Appraisal discussion is not a monologue: Make it a dialogue facilitating an exchange of ideas, impressions, expectations, and commitments.Appraisal meeting should not include surprises: Ideally, the annual appraisal should not be the only opportunity for sharing feedback. This is time to get agreements on the past and forge the ways for the future.Preparation is the key: The appraiser must give the appraisee sufficient time for preparation. Any ‘ask’ raised should be well structured and must address; the why, what, how, when and where.Seek clarity: Double-click on any ambiguous or vague comment or remark, seek specific instances and request for more details. It is important that you leave the meeting with clarity.Avoid judgemental words:As an appraiser, avoid using words that express blame or arrogance, etc. Bring situations and relate to the big picture and make sure you help find a way to do betterAs an appraisee, do not get defensive. Be open to receive feedback and ask more questions to bring clarity to the situation.Constructive criticism: Do not use words that make criticism relay a personality defect. Rather it should be situational, use examples rather than saying, ‘You always do it.’ etc.Development opportunities: The learning and development needs of the team member must be one of the action points.Even High performers need feedback: Praising and thanking the high performer is not enough. Understand their aspirations. Spend time on feedback about growth areas.Activate the coach in you: The appraiser should use enabling words and help the team member get not just the clarity but also the way to do better. Ask questions to understand their perspectives and help the employee come up with their own plan. Always ask open-ended questions. Even when you are being appraised, then also use the power of open-ended questions for better understanding.In this decade, human connections are going to gain much more important than before, let us try to make appraisal 2020 a human to human conversation. A dialogue where we have our hearts and minds in the right place.The author is an Executive and Leadership Coach - ICF-PCC, Conversational Intelligence (C-IQ) Enhanced Skills Practitioner and Author.Add Comment()Comments ()Characters Remaining: 3000SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmailOR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATIONXSort By: NewestOldestDiscussedUp VotedDown VotedBe the first one to comment.We have sent you a verification email.
