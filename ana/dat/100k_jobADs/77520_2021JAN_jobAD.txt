I'm going to have to mark it on my calendar!mdc3000 05-01-09 02:09 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"I think the premise sounds great and the trailer did look good, but I was waiting for something MORE to really hook me that never came in that trailer... it was kind of anticlimactic, but I'm there regardless, just to see if the hype about Blomkamp is justified.GCS 05-01-09 02:22 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"Very odd trailer. Not sure what to make of it.Hell I thought it was some documentary about something in the Middle East until they went to the \"interview clip\" with the creature.Weird, very weird.Gregstingermck 05-01-09 03:03 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"Yeah this trailer got a lot of WTF last night at Wolverine.RyoHazuki 05-01-09 03:49 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"Looks interesting but not the second coming of sci-fi. The brief bits of acting seemed kinda shaky.mdc3000 05-01-09 07:53 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"I think if the Alien dialogue had been subtitled with him saying some really freaky cool shit, this trailer would have been WAY better. This afternoon at Wolverine it got a LOT of \"what the fuck is that?\" and \"That looks shitty\" from the fairly vocal audience.islandclaws 05-01-09 08:39 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"Looks interesting. I'm a sucker for alien flicks, so I'll probably end up checking it out.Deftones 05-01-09 08:47 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"not a good trailer at all, but it does look intriguing.Superman07 05-01-09 09:52 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"Quote:Originally Posted by Deftones (Post 9420794)not a good trailer at all, but it does look intriguing.Isn't that the point of a teaser? :confused:What's the backstory on the production of this? I seem to recall seeing a lot of this footage prior to Halo 3 coming out.Solid Snake 05-01-09 10:33 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"The origianl short that he's expanding on..it's pretty damn good. It also made Jackson want to make this man the director of Halo. Politics aside..I think it would've been a good choice.<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/I9qFXurZaOE&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/I9qFXurZaOE&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>Matthew Chmiel 05-02-09 01:34 AMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"From script reviews to the footage shown at ShoWest; I'd love for this film to do well, but this isn't a film made to be a blockbuster.It's a science-fiction drama with elements of action and a slew of political and social commentary. The idea is intriguing and the short it's based on is fantastic. I hope that this film does well; but it may be too smart for the common person.Paul1957 05-07-09 10:45 AMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"Quote:Originally Posted by mdc3000 (Post 9420716)I think if the Alien dialogue had been subtitled with him saying some really freaky cool shit, this trailer would have been WAY better.

Looked kinda bad. District 9 on the other hand looks like it's a damn cool film for sure...Is there even a chance of Bloomkamp doing Halo anymore? Or is Universal and whatnot still being dicks about it?Matthew Chmiel 07-02-09 09:31 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"Someone let Chris know, TriStar got an R rating for the film and there's no plans to edit it or go for an appeal.sauce07 07-02-09 09:42 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"Quote:Originally Posted by Matthew Chmiel (Post 9542291)Someone let Chris know, TriStar got an R rating for the film and there's no plans to edit it or go for an appeal.It doesn't matter, no way this movie is over 2 hours.redrum 07-08-09 04:39 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"<object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/-uQGu6p5N18&hl=en&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/-uQGu6p5N18&hl=en&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></embed></object>The Bus 07-08-09 04:43 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\":drool: Now it looks even better.Draven 07-08-09 04:52 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"Um...SOLDIndy Jones Fan 07-08-09 05:32 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"That new trailer just amped things up for sure.lopper 07-08-09 05:39 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"Goddamn that looks slick.

If the mouthbreathers at ScyFy had half a brain, they would have adapted this into a series.treszoks 07-08-09 06:43 PMRe: District 9 (Blomkamp, 2009) — Ex-Halo director fleshes out \"Alive in Joburg\"Yes please.All times are GMT -5.
