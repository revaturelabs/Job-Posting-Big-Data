Ford is reducing its total number of plants in the region to 18.The company said that the positions would be eliminated mostly through voluntary agreements through the end of 2020. Some 2,000 of the cuts will be salaried positions, part of 7,000 white collar jobs being shed as part of a global restructuring by the Ford Motor Co., which is based in Dearborn, Michigan.\"Separating employees and closing plants are the hardest decisions we make,\" said Ford of Europe President Stuart Rowley.He said the company was \"providing support to ease the impact.\"The figure of 12,000 job losses includes some that have already been announced, such as 1,700 from the proposed closing of the engine plant in Bridgend, Wales. Ford is also closing a plant in France, three in Russia, and is selling another in Slovakia.The losses come from among the 56,000 people employed on salaried, hourly and agency bases by Ford of Europe as of last year.Ford of Europe, based in Cologne, Germany, said it hopes to \"significantly improve\" its financial results, after losing $398 million in 2018. Rowley told reporters on a conference call that financials would improve this year but stopped short of predicting a full-year profit.Ford and other global automakers are facing multiple challenges, including the expensive push to develop electric cars that will help them meet new emission rules in Europe and comply with regulations favoring alternative energy vehicles in China. They need strong profits to fund those investments. Ford of Europe said all its new vehicles would come with an electric variant, such as a battery or battery-internal combustion hybrid, and that it would build a future family of electric vehicles in Europe.Carmakers are also adapting to a shift in consumer demand to SUVs and to weaker demand for more traditional configurations such as sedans and hatchbacks. Longer-term challenges include the development of autonomous vehicles. Ford is in talks with Volkswagen about possibly developing self-driving cars together.General Motors said in November that it would lay off 14,000 factory and white-collar workers in North America and put five plants up for possible closure as it restructures to cut costs and focus more on autonomous and electric technology. Daimler, maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, is working on a cost-cutting program under new CEO Ola Kallenius, while Volkswagen said in March it would eliminate up to 7,000 jobs by 2023. That's on top of a 2016 job reduction agreement that foresaw the loss of 23,000 jobs through 2020, and the addition of 9,000 through new technology.RelatedFord to Close 'Unsustainable' PlantJun 6th, 2019Ford to Spend Roughly $740M on DetroitAug 15th, 2018Ford to Cut $14B in Costs, Drop ModelsOct 4th, 2017Ford CEO Hopes for Eased Fuel RegsJan 27th, 2017Latest in OperationsDivers Find Parts of Crashed Plane's Black BoxJan 15th, 2021Hitachi Renovating Factory to Build Electric MotorsJan 15th, 2021US Industrial Production Up 1.6% in DecemberJan 15th, 20212 Nuke Plants, 1 Bribery Scandal, No AnswersJan 15th, 2021More in OperationsVideoFactory Faces Backlash Over Distancing MonitorsUnion representatives say the devices \"infantilize\" workers.Jan 15th, 2021OperationsUnemployment Claims Jump as Virus Takes TollThe number of people seeking unemployment aid soared to its highest level since late August.Jan 14th, 2021HomeThe Digital Transformation — Part II: How to Start Your JourneyThe \"all or nothing\" game is a thing of the past.Jan 13th, 2021HomeVolkswagen Sales Down 15% in Pandemic YearSales of battery-only cars, however, jumped 214%.Jan 13th, 2021HomeSearchers Hunt for Crashed Plane's Voice RecorderAt least 160 divers were deployed to find the recorder that holds conversations between pilots.Jan 13th, 2021AutomationPolicy Management in the Human-Cobot Workforce EraHow will manufacturers know that their employees are prepared for working closely with autonomous machines?Oct 4th, 2020HomePandemic Threatens Plans to Retrieve Titanic's RadioThe Marconi wireless telegraph machine sent distress calls to nearby ships.Jan 12th, 2021HomeJob Openings Down, Layoffs SpikeThe slowdown in job postings was widespread across most industries.Jan 12th, 2021HomeRespiratory Therapist Sentenced for Stealing COVID EquipmentHe pleaded guilty to stealing a ventilator and other equipment and selling it for personal gain.Jan 12th, 2021HomeGM Forms New Electric Delivery BusinessIts first product will be an electric-powered wheeled pallet to take goods from warehouse to truck to destination.Jan 12th, 2021HomeVolkswagen Triples Electric Car Sales Ahead of Climate RulesGermany saw more people buy electrics than diesels last month.Jan 12th, 2021HomeCompany Defies State's Demand to Shut Down PipelineEnbridge said it would continue to operate the oil pipeline through the Straits of Mackinac.Jan 12th, 2021Follow UsFacebook iconTwitter iconYouTube iconInstagram iconLinkedIn iconMost RecentJumbo 500ºF Walk-In OvenExtreme Heat Resistant Powder Coating RemoverLawsuit Says Community College Program was Human TraffickingBiden to Tap Defense Production Act to Maximize Vaccine ManufacturingShot Meter Dispensing SystemFacebook iconTwitter iconYouTube iconInstagram iconLinkedIn iconAbout UsContact UsAdvertisePrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsCA Consumer Privacy Act© 2021 Industrial Media, LLC.
