I will say this, if you came from a policing background to the patrol, you will be seriously disappointed, especially if you came recently because the traffic is so slow. I literally miss my days as a Deputy Sheriff. Even on the slowest days, I could be proactive and find something to do. Here, if it is slow, there is nothing you can do to be proactive. You can only cut so many roads, check so many lay up spots, pull over so many code 4 cars before you start to get burned out.Natural selection leaves the survivors stronger and better! Humans have escaped this winnowing for far too long!CommentPostCancelBF280Forum MemberJoin Date: Jul 2010Posts: 130ShareTweet#771311-25-2012, 11:48 AMAlmost retired? You calling me old?!?! Haha! The reason for the change was because I hadn't had a pay increase in five years making less than $40K. In the patrol my salary doubled. The problem is that the patrol is making some serious steps to eliminate the opportuniity to make that kind of money. It's still good money if they cut us to our base salary. But, there are local pd's making similair money as our base salary with a much higher job satisfaction. I still think that overall the patrol is going to have better pay and benefits. I think we will know what the direction the patrol is going to take in the next 12 months.CommentPostCancelMotocrossx23Forum MemberJoin Date: Oct 2012Posts: 19ShareTweet#771412-01-2012, 12:53 PMAnyone hear anything lately?BPAApp Date: 09/03/2011Exam Date: 11/21/2011GEO: San DiegoTSL: 05/30/2012PFT1: PassedMed: PassedTSL2: 08/17/12OB: 09/15/12 (Passed)Drug Screening: PassedPoly: Pending ResultsCommentPostCancelGet SomeForum MemberJoin Date: Apr 2012Posts: 88ShareTweet#771512-02-2012, 03:18 PMOriginally posted by Motocrossx23 View PostAnyone hear anything lately?+1MSP 1896CommentPostCancelsemper03Forum MemberJoin Date: Sep 2011Posts: 358ShareTweet#771612-02-2012, 04:01 PMThe \"chatter\" - 7 classes approved for 2013? 350 (7 classes x 50 bodies) some hires.http://forums.delphiforums.com/borde...s?msg=54842.23Last edited by semper03; 12-02-2012, 04:07 PM.CommentPostCancelMotocrossx23Forum MemberJoin Date: Oct 2012Posts: 19ShareTweet#771712-02-2012, 08:08 PMThat's promising.BPAApp Date: 09/03/2011Exam Date: 11/21/2011GEO: San DiegoTSL: 05/30/2012PFT1: PassedMed: PassedTSL2: 08/17/12OB: 09/15/12 (Passed)Drug Screening: PassedPoly: Pending ResultsCommentPostCancelGet SomeForum MemberJoin Date: Apr 2012Posts: 88ShareTweet#771812-07-2012, 11:23 PMIf I have completed a Medical 8/11 for CBPO will I have to do so again when applying to a new announcement for BP if its less than a year?Or will it transfer over?ThanksMSP 1896CommentPostCancelJtursForum MemberJoin Date: Aug 2012Posts: 28ShareTweet#771912-08-2012, 10:32 PMBeen a lurker for a while around this site. just wanted to ask if anyone EODs jan 28 in el paso to be stationed in Weslaco Tx? i finally got the call yesterday morning with a offer of a GS-5 position in Rio Grande City or Weslaco which is near Mercedes and Mccallen.

One generally Enters On Duty at the sector headquarters of their assigned station, then travels to El Paso for some CBP stuff, then goes to Artesia. It could be different in your case, but I doubt it, as the process is fairly rigid.Weslaco is in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, the headquarters of which is in McAllen.Good luck in your endeavors.CommentPostCancelstriketmForum MemberJoin Date: Nov 2010Posts: 300ShareTweet#772112-18-2012, 02:42 PMdoes anybody know what score is getting TSL1 right now??Go wildcats!CommentPostCanceljsu7833mForum MemberJoin Date: Dec 2012Posts: 61ShareTweet#772212-20-2012, 11:28 AMstriketm, I took the BPA exam January 2011 and got a score of 73. I honestly did not think twice about it after getting such a low score. Tuesday I recieved an email saying this:\"\"Dear Border Patrol Agent Applicant:Our records indicate that you have an active record on the Border Patrol Agent (BPA) applicant inventory for the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).Why are we sending you this letter?This letter is let you know that the Minneapolis Hiring Center continues to make tentative selections for the Southwest Border from this inventory. Please continue to monitor your email weekly as tentative selection offers are made via email.What do I need to do?If you are still interested in an entry-level Border Patrol Agent position you are not required to do anything; unless you need to update your contact information. To update your contact information simply send an email to the Minneapolis Hiring Center at: Please be sure to include your full name, last four digits of your social security number and updated contact information.What if I no longer want to pursue a career as a Border Patrol Agent?You may email the Minneapolis Hiring Center with your full name, last four digits of your social security number and a brief statement asking to be removed from the inventory. .Thank you for your continued interest in a position with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Minneapolis Hiring CenterU.S. Customs & Border Protection\"\"\"I contacted them and via email to give them a new phone number and got this reply:\"\"The BPA announcement is currently closed. We are currently selecting applicants in score order from 110-70. Once we reach your score you will be contacted via email. For more information on the position of BPA . If you have received a tentative selection letter and applicant ID please contact the BPA Staffing unit at: 952-857-2910 or [email protected] We will respond to your email as quickly as we can. \"\"So I guess after almost 2 years they are reaching the mid 70s .
