Back on Wednesday, 3 June 2015, and Sunday, 7 June 2015, hooman staff, male, aka Catman aka Daddy, was attacked by 2 separate RedWing Blackbirds while doing PT (physical training ‚Äì i.e. jogging), within 2 kilometers of Angus Barracks and Bunny Memorial National Cemetery. The first attack consisted of actual physical contact ‚Äì i.e. the bird tried to attack his head, making contact with his head, which for many people, would consist of a hooman brain. The second attack was not as close, but the bird swooped within 1-2 meters with Catman waving his hat, cussing, and looking utterly ridiculous.I have submitted a youtube video of how ferocious these redwing blackbird can be. THIS IS NOT CATMAN, but some random dude on youtube, who is also being attacked by this developing scourge.Now, this takes me to the patrol of today, 12 June 2015, Evening Hours. About 5 blocks south of Angus Manor (Under New Management), 2 redwing blackbirds swept down in proximity of Catman‚Äôs head, while I was being walked. On three (3) occassions. Then, Catman though, hmmm, I have a vermin killer here, with 3 confirmed bunny kills (and who knows how many unconfirmed, cause a proper Scottie lady does not kill and tell). So he hoisted me high in the air, and the redwing blackbirds, while still swooping and cawing, made sure they stayed well away, 4-5 meters above, these killer Scottie jaws. Of course, Catman looked utterly ridiculous, but that is not extra-ordinary (see paragraph above).When I got home, Catman demonstrated to Mama the defensive tactics that we mutually employed (here I am wearing a PBARCC-C (polymer Based Attack repellent cranium cover ‚Äì camouflage), while in the real battle, I was not wearing any cranium protection.So, I have three recommendations to respectfully submit to you, Scottie High Command, your eminence, sirs and ma‚Äôams.First, we need to categorize redwing blackbirds as hostile, and classify them from vermin-2b (secondary) to vermin-1a (primary).Second ‚Äì when combating our vermin-1a (primary) avian adversaries, (ie. redwing blackbird), we may require a boost from a qualified staff member. If no qualified staff is available, a Catman in my case, or a Mr. So, in Penny McNess‚Äôs case, will have to suffice.Third, when executing maneuver as discussed above, a PBARCC-C (Polymer based attack repellent cranium cover ‚Äì camouflage) should be utilized.Thank you for your time.Respectively,LT Ainsley McKenna (Captain rank pending)Share this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...Published by angus fala worldwide9 year old scottie, CEO of Angus Fala Worldwide Enterprises.

Ace (perfect dog of the house before Missy and us) tangled with a Mocking bird in the Eastern PA section back in the 90‚Äôs. Well, he had a bark out with it, no harm to feather or fur.LikeLiked by 1 personReplyfergusnguinness says:	June 13, 2015 at 4:00 amGuess we were not logged in‚Ä¶dang üôÇLikeLikeReplyginaandjordanandmolly says:	June 13, 2015 at 9:59 amWell the NERVE of those hostile redwing blackbirds. Do these blackbirds not realize that it won‚Äôt take a Scottie (with the aid of either Catman or Mr So), or for Catman or Mr So (with the aid of said Scottie and Penny McNess Scottie) long to collect Four and Twenty of these evil vermin and we all know the fate that will befall them then !!! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and that is just the start of it. I can easily see Scottie Stall located on the corner near Angus Manor (under new management) selling Blackbird Pie !!! Aunt Judy will do the baking.LikeLiked by 3 peopleReplyangus fala worldwide says:	June 13, 2015 at 10:08 amBlackbird pie ‚Äì an excellent new venture by Angus Fala Worldwide ‚Äì thanks for the concept!LikeLiked by 2 peopleReplySkyler Braveheart says:	June 13, 2015 at 2:36 pmKismet, you would be an awesome and most worthy opponent !LikeLikeAnonymous says:	June 13, 2015 at 12:26 pmI must say you looks spectacular suspended high in the airLikeLiked by 1 personReplyLinda Rosenberg says:	June 13, 2015 at 1:11 pmYou are fantastic, Ainsley, I‚Äôm sure that you will get a promotion now!LikeLiked by 2 peopleReplyidiane2scots says:	June 13, 2015 at 2:15 pmBlackbirds might be protecting their nesting area. No rest for a soldier, right, Ainsley?LikeLiked by 1 personReplySkyler Braveheart says:	June 13, 2015 at 2:39 pmAinsley, I applaud the teamwork you and Catman employed to deter these Nursery Rhyme characters‚Ä¶.however I have to agree that they might be protecting their nest. Can Catman take another route? Of course now that he has you to protect him, that must be a moot point. Yrs Faithfully, Skyler BraveheartLikeLiked by 1 personReplyangus fala worldwide says:	June 15, 2015 at 2:33 amobviously he is too stoopid to ‚Äì he got attacked by the same bird from 3 June 2015 at the same location today.LikeLiked by 1 personReplyhollydietor says:	June 13, 2015 at 3:38 pmSo, they probably just sense that Catman is easy pickings because the Red Wings who come to our feeder here on Argyle Estates flee whenever he comes out or in the Dammit Door. I suggest we send Sgt. Angus to your compound to show you how to defend yourself. Catman is on his own‚Ä¶survival of the fittest, that sort of thing. Please let me know when you wish Sgt. Argyle to report for duty.LikeLiked by 2 peopleReplyangus fala worldwide says:	June 15, 2015 at 2:32 amHe got attacked again this afternoon on his daily PT run. I was at home thoughLikeLiked by 1 personReplykryshaepona says:	June 13, 2015 at 5:24 pmHave we not see Alfred Hitchcock‚Äôs The Birds???LikeLiked by 2 peopleReplyLeave a Reply to Linda Rosenberg Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (Address never made public)NameWebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
