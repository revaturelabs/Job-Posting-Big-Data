"Despite record profits, Apple stock slides over Jobs' health fears – TechCrunch (future)Despite record profits, Apple stock slides over Jobs' health fearsNicholas Deleon	@nicholasadeleon / 12 years	Those rumors of Steve Jobs being in ill health aren’t doing the company any favors. Apple’s stock dropped some 11 percent overnight, despite the fact that the company pulled in $9 billion in profits, primarily fueled by record Mac sales. That Steve Jobs himself wasn’t present at the conference call raised investors’ suspicions.The company’s CFO called Jobs’ health a “private matter,” which the always-jittery Wall Street didn’t take too well, Hence, the stock slide.Apparently Wall Street is a little concerned over Apple’s perceived lack of planning for Jobs’ successor, especially since His Steveness is seen as the driving force behind Apple’s recent success."
