In a world surrounded by competition, there is no doubt that everyone tries their best to shine by showing what they have and what makes their skills more special than others. It is quite disappointing that all people have to fill up their abilities only on one or two pages.

The blog is a collaboration space where the employer can see a real you like attitude, ability to innovate, think, and communication skills. It will help them know what type of person you are and how likely you may fit with their organization. To make it simple to understand, the blog can explain yourself more than the resume or CV does.Tell Them What You GotWho says creating a blog is just a piece of cake? There is a difference between “doing it” and “create it”. “Doing it” means you do something because someone has forced you or due to your duty to get your work done, no matter whether you would be happy to do that or not. It differs from “creating it” in the way that you have to put so much effort and time into your work. Creating a blog has helped you gain lots of skills to write down to your job applicant.
