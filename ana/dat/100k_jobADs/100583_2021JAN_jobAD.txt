It straps to the legs and disperses the user’s body weight.That makes standing less tiring and can provide relief from leg and back pain for factory workers, surgeons, and others who need to stand for hours at a time, the company says.“It allows people to walk or move while wearing it and people can put it on easily regardless of their body shape or size,” said Katsuhiko Saho, Archelis’ business development manager.Archelis said the product is set to launch this year, retailing at around $5,000.Post navigationPrevious Previous post:Next Next post:Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
