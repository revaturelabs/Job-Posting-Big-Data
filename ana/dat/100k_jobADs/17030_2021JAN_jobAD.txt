Today I’m announcing the start of Standout Jobs, a company I’ve founded with Fred Ngo and Austin Hill.We won’t be giving out a lot of details in the near future, but check out the landing page and sign up to receive news.On a personal note, I’m thrilled to be working with these guys on this very cool project. I’ve already learned an absolute ton, been inspired more than I have in years, and met some amazing people. We’re building a great team, pushing a great idea, and you can be sure that we’ll knock some heads and raise some eyebrows along the way. Maybe we’ll get a few gasps and cheers too…Standout Jobs is about helping employers find the best candidates faster. It’s about opening up lines of communication and taking the boring, unending processes out of hiring. We want to change the way you recruit, because the way you hire people right now doesn’t work.Stay up-to-date at http://www.standoutjobs.com.Filed Under: Standout JobsWant more content like this?Signup for free and you'll get new content as soon as it's available.
