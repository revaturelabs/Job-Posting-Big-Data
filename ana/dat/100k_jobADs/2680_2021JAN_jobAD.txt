We will work closely with our local councils to ensure projects get underway – supporting jobs and businesses as soon as possible.”Funding for projects throughout the electorate of Makin are estimated to support approximately 50 jobs. This funding includes:$689,699 for tree planting throughout City of Port Adelaide Enfield to improve landscaping throughout their area and help to meet the council’s target of planting more than 2,500 new trees each year.$1,683,846 to the City of Salisbury for 3 projects including renewal of roadside sections to improve amenity and visual appeal, as well as improving safe and effective drop-off and pick-up activity around Ingle Farm Primary School.$1,130,000 to the City of Tea Tree Gully for 4 projects including upgrade of Tilley Reserve lighting, Australia Avenue parking realignment and upgrading Waterworld Aquatic Centre’s heating system.Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development Michael McCormack said the projects funded under the Program will improve the quality of life of Australians and have lasting economic and social benefits for local communities.“Our funding boost will help communities across Australia accelerate priority projects to get people into jobs and stimulate our economy,” the Deputy Prime Minister said.“We know how important our support is to communities who have faced the combined effects of drought, bushfires and now COVID-19, which is why we are backing projects to create employment and business opportunities while cutting travel times, as well as making our roads and communities safer.“Having only announced the program in late May, we are moving decisively to deliver the support councils and communities need to get through this pandemic and get back on their feet.”In May 2020, the Morrison Government also pre-paid $1.3 billion of this year’s Financial Assistance Grant to provide untied funding for all local councils across Australia to spend on local priorities.More information on the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is available here.Ends.Tags: Jobs, Makin, Road Safety, Government, Senator for South Australia, Infrastructure, RoadsPost navigationReport on the COVID-19 pandemic’s implications for Australia’s foreign affairs, defence and tradeFawcett Flyer November/December 2020Recent PostsFawcett Flyer November/December 2020Roads and Community Infrastructure Funding to Create Local Jobs in MakinReport on the COVID-19 pandemic’s implications for Australia’s foreign affairs, defence and tradeAustralian Magnitsky-style law recommendedProcurement: priorities, partnership and programming – no future in past practice, in ASPI’s After COVID-19 Volume 3: Voices from federal parliamentCategoriesMedia ReleaseOpinion EditorialFawcett FlyerNewsQuick LinksHomeIn the SenateMinisterial ServiceCommitteesSpeechesNewsAbout DavidGet in TouchCommunity SurveySmall Business SurveyNewsletter SignupJoin the ConversationCall David (08) 8205 1040Email David [email protected]Authorised by Senator David Fawcett, Liberal Party of Australia, Adelaide, SA."
