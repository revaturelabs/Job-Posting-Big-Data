Typical employers | Qualifications and training | Key skillsTechnical support (or IT support) professionals help resolve customers’ technical problems via email, phone, social media and in person.Professionals in this area either work in-house (providing support within a particular organisation) or provide support and services to other businesses, to customers of a particular product, or on an ad hoc basis. For example, there is a growing market for on-demand services for home and office tech repair, set-up and troubleshooting. Companies providing this service dispatch their support analysts when summoned to fix anything from a cracked iPhone screen to a tricky installation or a laptop riddled with malware.Typical duties include:logging and processing support callsinstalling and configuring computer hardware, software, systems, networks, printers and scannersplanning and undertaking scheduled maintenance upgradessetting up accounts for staff, ensuring that they know how to log insolving password problemstalking to clients and computer users to determine the nature of any problems they encounterresponding to breakdownsinvestigating, diagnosing and solving computer software and hardware faultsrepairing equipment and replacing partssupervising junior engineering and technical staffobtaining replacement or specialist components, fixtures or fittingschecking computer equipment for electrical safetymaintaining records of software licencesmanaging stocks of equipment, consumables and other suppliesTypical employers of IT support analystsBanks and financial service companiesManufacturing firms and service areasSchools, colleges and universitiesPublic sector organisations, such as the NHS and local authoritiesElectronics retailersSoftware retailersAlmost all SMEs and larger companies recruit IT support staff to assist employeesJobs are advertised online, by careers services and by recruitment agencies.View our graduate IT and technology vacancies.Qualifications and training requiredBoth university graduates and school leavers can enter the IT support or helpdesk profession. Whether you have a degree or not, you will need to demonstrate an interest in fixing technical problems, either through previous work experience or activities you have completed in your own time.While open to graduates of any discipline, technical support employers typically prefer graduates with an IT-related qualification.It is often possible to enter this career without a degree. Apprenticeships are available in IT support, sometimes requiring GCSEs only. To find out more about getting into IT and technology via a school leaver route, visit the IT and technology section of TARGETcareers, our website aimed at school leavers.Many IT support analysts advance their careers by broadening their skills within a specific industry or area. Large companies with an extensive technical infrastructure may have separate teams dealing with different areas of their business. With experience, a move to a specialist area dealing with more complex technical environments is possible. Another option is to take on the role of team or section leader.Key skills for IT support/helpdeskIn-depth knowledge of hardware and softwareUp-to-date knowledge of the latest IT and software trendsStrong customer service ethosAbility to work well with peopleStrong communications skillsExcellent organisational skillsAbility to quickly establish good working relationships with clientsWillingness to sometimes work unsociable hoursPatienceA logical mindEnthusiasm for continual learningRelated job descriptionsUX designer: job descriptionData scientist: job descriptionInformation systems manager: job descriptionSystems developer: job descriptionNetwork administrator: job descriptionData analyst: job descriptionInformation technology/software trainers: job descriptionWeb designer: job descriptionTechnical author: job descriptionSystems analyst: job descriptionSupported byThis describes editorially independent and objective content, written and edited by the GTI content team, with which the organisation would like to be associated and has provided some funding in order to be so.
