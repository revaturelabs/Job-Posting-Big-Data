The final year of KS1 will see your pupils being encouraged to work more independently. At this age, most children will have improved their ability to coordinate movement and their language/speech will be increasingly complex and grammatically correct.Mathematics in Year 2 focuses on the 2, 5 and 10 times-tables. Children in Year 2 will learn to add and subtract with two-digit and one-digit numbers. They will learn multiplication and division facts for the 2, 5 and 10 times-tables. In fractions, they will find 1/3, 1/4 1/2 and 3/4 of a shape or a quantity of objects. They will study measures, including weight, capacity and length, and they will learn to tell the time to five minutes.In English, the children will continue to work on the phonics they have learned in Year 1, aiming to read words by sight without having to sound them out individually. They will learn further spelling patterns and rules, and begin to apply those in their writing. They will look at the possessive apostrophe, homophones and near homophones and suffixes.​Northamptonshire​Daily supply, long-term, part-time and full-time jobs in Northamptonshire primary, secondary and special needs schools.Protocol EducationMedia Enquiries ​Press line: 020 7340 1152Email: ian@gkstrategy.comFollow usBlogsAbout UsContact UsGender Pay GapModern Slavery StatementCandidatesNursery NursesPrimary TeachersPrimary SupportSecondary TeachersSEND TeachersSEND SupportTrainingOnline Training CoursesTeam Teach TrainingSchoolsNursery & Early YearsSEND Schools and UnitsSecondary SchoolsPrimary SchoolsSubmit a VacancyCOVID-19 Agency Staff Re-entry PlanHelp CentreRegistration ProcessSafeguarding ChecksCV TipsFAQPolicies, Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookies Policy© Protocol Education.
