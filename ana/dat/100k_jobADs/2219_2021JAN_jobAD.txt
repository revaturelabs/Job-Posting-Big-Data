The building, however, proved to be structurally unsafe, so the project transformed into a landscaped and paved area. This included a bench that is rumoured to be the longest continuous bench in London!Each pavement slab was so heavy that it took 2-3 men with an industrial slab lifter to move around and position them.The Yorkstone used is a natural product sourced from Yorkshire and each slab was cut to order.Total area laid was circa 174 m2.974 plants planted.8 tons of mulch used on the planter beds.Recently completed job: The Polygon Project, Clapham2019-04-022020-07-09/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/rme-logo-90.jpgRME Serviceshttps://www.rmeservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/polygon-1-281x210.jpg200px200pxRecent PostsNHS Covid-19 drive-through testing facility installationRecently completed job: Car park resurfacingRecently completed job: Boiler replacement, The Hub, Regents ParkContact DetailsRME Services Ltd6 Bourne Mill Business Park,Guildford Road, Farnham,Surrey, GU9 9PSTel: 01252 718024Privacy PolicyCLICK HERE TO CONTACT USCompany Registration No: 3154571DownloadsRME Services Environmental PolicyRME Sustainable Procurement PolicyRME Health & Safety PolicyRME Corporate Social Responsibility PolicyRME Quality Management PolicyClient FeedbackClick here to submit your feedbackPopular LinksRME's response to COVID 19NewsProject workAbout RMERME Awarded New ContractsContact usReactive & response worksClient Feedback QuestionnaireSearchCopyright All Rights Reserved © 2016Contact UsSend us a messageNot readable?
