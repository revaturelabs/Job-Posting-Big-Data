We are at the cutting edge of developing new ways of delivering health services, with ambitious plans to integrate health and care across the area through our multi-agency partnership ‘Healthier Fylde Coast’.With its historic reputation as Britain’s favourite seaside destination, the town still attracts around 18million visitors annually. This along with local demographic factors such as increased deprivation and prevalence of complex conditions present a real challenge to the delivery of healthcare services.
