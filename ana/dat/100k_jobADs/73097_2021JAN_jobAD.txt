Our vision is a world where cancer doesn’t stop young people from living their lives – and our job in making that vision a reality is to improve the experience, survival and recovery of every young person with cancer in the UK.Teenage Cancer Trust has been a hugely successful organisation for many years – leading the way in specialist support for young people with cancer in the UK and across the globe. We’re driven by what young people with cancer need and are the UK’s leading charity dedicated solely to the treatment, care and support of 13-25-year olds with cancer.What’s clear is that we have significant opportunities to further expand and deepen our impact - but doing that in the face of the challenges to income posed by the current pandemic is going to be challenging.We have just gone through a change process to ensure we have the structure that enables us to stabilise our income now and grow it over the coming years. We have a talented team of fundraisers who are not daunted by the challenge ahead, far from it, they have achieved more than we ever thought was possible in the last year and we’re looking for a Deputy Director of Relationship Fundraising who can rise to the challenge with them, seize opportunities and give our teams the leadership they deserve.With the right leaders in place at Deputy Director we are certain we will rebuild revenue and develop our fundraisers, so that we not only survive but thrive. Relationship Fundraising is a business-critical new function at Teenage Cancer Trust which aims to bring all of our key relationship fundraising teams together to enable us to share skill sets, develop a collaborative and creative approach to relationship management and innovate to ensure success in the new environment. You will have overall accountability for delivering significant income growth across all areas of Relationship Fundraising including philanthropy, music, special events, trust, corporate and community.Following strategic reviews in late 2019, we know we have huge untapped potential across philanthropy, music, special events, trust, corporate and community. Although some of these incomes have been hit hard by the pandemic we are certain with the right Deputy Director we can continue to create real change across all of these income lines.This is not an organisation – or role - that’s about more of the same or one size fits all. We are looking for the right leader, with the right approach to make sure that every fundraiser in their team is exciting about the future and enjoys what they are doing.This role has the potential to be life changing - not only for young people with cancer - but also for you and the talented, experienced teams you will be leading and empowering.We need our Deputy Directors to be brilliant cross-organisational leaders with stacks of emotional intelligence and stakeholder engagement skills. You will thrive when working in partnership and making alliances. Success and strength are not about us doing everything – it’s about getting everything done with others. At Teenage Cancer Trust we succeed, fail & learn together and are stronger than the sum of our parts.If this sounds like you, we would love to hear from you.You can view the Job Description before coming back to this page to apply.
