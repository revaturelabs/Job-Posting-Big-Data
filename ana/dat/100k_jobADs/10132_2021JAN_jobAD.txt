Or something else?I suggest that we fix Brexit first.Last year people voted Conservative because they thought Brexit was a distraction from Britain’s real problems. Over 70% of the public thought this. Most people who voted Remain thought this. They thought that the only way to get Brexit out of the way, was to push it through.Of course this isn’t true. Brexit isn’t over. And we’ll be stuck with the problems it creates for decades.But if we campaign to rejoin straight away, it will be counter-productive. People won’t see the problems caused by Brexit, because most of them won’t be obvious until the transition period ends.And, just as everybody sighs in relief that Brexit is over, we’ll look like obsessives wanting to restart the argument. A bit like John Redwood in the 1990s.The British people have given the government a chance to get Brexit right.Lib Dems should therefore work to fix Brexit. Fixing Brexit means accepting it’s happening. For now.That means minimising the damage. Damage done to the economy. And damage done to our friends and neighbours.Today there are three things we can campaign on.Continue reading »Posted in Op-eds | Also tagged brexit, european arrest warrant, featured and freedom of movement | 42 CommentsJo Swinson MP writes: Another week of Brexit chaos, another week of government ignoring the big issuesBy Jo Swinson MP | Wed 27th March 2019 - 4:00 pmOn Monday morning the ONS revealed that 1.5 million workers in England alone could lose their jobs to automation, with young people, women and the low-skilled most at risk. Just as we start yet another week of absolute chaos in Parliament over Brexit, I am seriously concerned that no one in Government is thinking about how technology will shape our society.As liberals, we instinctively embrace change, and we want to harness technological progress to solve challenges from disease to climate change. However, we must take steps now to ensure that everyone in society benefits from that progress. This is why we have called on companies with more than 250 employees to develop plans to support staff vulnerable to automation, and for Government to grant every adult £9,000 over their lifetime to fund lifelong learning.Also on Monday morning, I hosted the second meeting of the Lib Dem Tech Commission together with Professor Sue Black. We started with a discussion about what kind of economy we want to build and broadly agreed that as a country we need to be better at encouraging entrepreneurship and at encouraging individuals to make mistakes and learn from failure.However, to try something and be comfortable with failing is a luxury that only few can afford at the moment. As a society, we need to offer much stronger safety nets to ensure that many others can transform their ideas into successful businesses.Continue reading »Posted in News and Op-eds | Also tagged technology | 10 Comments10 January 2019 – today’s press releasesBy Mark Valladares | Thu 10th January 2019 - 11:59 pmI’m posting on the fly today, as I’ve allowed myself to become distracted by other things.

I think the number is exaggerated, which is not unusual for the police.”Following the exchange, Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesperson Ed Davey said:Police chiefs are warning of…Continue reading »Posted in News | Also tagged brexit, crime, ed davey, jane dodds, policing and vince cable | Leave a commentBrighton debate: Good Jobs, Better Businesses, Stronger CommunitiesBy Mike Tuffrey | Thu 6th September 2018 - 6:33 pmRoll up, roll up – take your seats. Monday afternoon of conference week in Brighton brings a debate on proposals for creating a new economy, one that really works for everyone in Britain. As the party “demands better”, this forward-looking plan shows how we can tackle the root causes of our current dysfunctional economy and to provide real content to our campaigning on that central political issue of “the economy, stupid” (as Bill Clinton’s campaign strategist inelegantly put it).The debate on Motion F28 – Good Jobs, Better Businesses, Stronger Communities – is your chance to accept, reject, amend or better still improve upon the ideas contained in the FPC’s paper of the same name, available to download here. Do have a good read in advance, there’s a lot of great content to digest.On this site, Katharine Pindar has already helpfully examined it through the lens of how Labour voters might see us, as an alternative to Corbynomics.Developed over two years through our deliberative policy-making process, the package of proposals had a longer gestation period even than an African bush elephant: the working group (which I co-chaired with Julia Goldsworthy until she was appointed to a politically restricted job) took evidence and consulted widely, and then had to pause for Theresa May’s ill-fated snap general election.Our original consultation paper back in 2017 set out the challenges we had identified in creating a more prosperous and sustainable economic future for Britain in the 21st century – low productivity, new technologies, changing demographics, the folly of Brexit, resource depletion, rising inequalities, a trends towards ever bigger companies and reduced competition, and much more. Despite this depressing back-drop, we said Liberal Democrats are inherently optimistic and should embrace the potential of change and of the big economic shifts that we saw coming. We should not retreat, we argued, either to the little Britain ‘drawbridge economy’ envisaged by post-Brexit Conservatives or to Labour’s ‘big government knows best’ 1970s style siege economy.Continue reading »Posted in Op-eds | Also tagged autumn conference 2018, economy and featured | 9 CommentsNew thinking on job creationBy John Knox | Wed 26th July 2017 - 6:23 pmEmbed from Getty ImagesOne of the big challenges of our time is to provide work for all those who need it, work which is useful, fulfilling and which pays enough to live on. And although the British economy is creating around half a million jobs (net) a year, many of them do not satisfy those simple criterion.The need for good quality jobs will increase as the population increases and working careers get longer, yet hardly anyone is thinking about where these jobs are to come from. Government departments, unions and think-tanks tend to concentrate on where jobs have been created in the past or predicting where they may come in the future, or on skills training or how to improve conditions for those already in work. The private sector seems to regard jobs as a by-product, a necessary evil in the process of making a profit, and in the public sector the government wants to cut as many jobs as possible to save tax-payers’ money. No one is actively looking at areas where new and worthwhile jobs can be created and how to do it.Let me be bold and suggest six sectors where this might be done, in what I call the “infinite industries” ie where there is no limit to the amount of production that can be done: education, health, energy, environment, sport and the arts.Continue reading »Posted in Op-eds | Also tagged economy | 27 CommentsOpportunities? Brexiteers, please specifyBy Arnold Kiel | Wed 23rd November 2016 - 12:39 pmThe motives and backgrounds of leave-voters are by now sufficiently understood to conclude that many of them cannot afford to and would not have voted for becoming substantially and permanently poorer. Some may, but had it been widely understood that Brexit comes at a high economic price for everybody, the result would have been a different one.Apparently, most leavers dismissed the economic arguments of remain, and instead of asking for better arguments from leave bought the “scaremongering”-claim (admittedly, leave was much better at creating slogans). And this continues: leave already claims victory on the economy after 6 months in which nothing (apart from a 15% devaluation of the country) has happened. Luckily, consumers so far remain complacent and keep spending.I know the typical response I can expect from Brexiteers: unsubstantiated claims (“see the opportunities”, “champions of free trade”…), denial (“Q3 was good”), fluffy sovereignty-talk (“Brussels”), and pressure (“how dare you not respecting the will of the people?”). Is that all you have got?May I challenge you to think a little harder? Specify trading opportunities the UK currently misses because of EU membership, which outweigh the losses from leaving the single market. In other words: How and when will you have replaced the benefits of preferential access to 27 EU member states and the EUs’ 53 third-country agreements with higher yielding UK-deals? How and when will you recover the transitional losses? Will the current generation of young people recover from the damage within their professionally active lifetime? No leave-campaigner has ever presented any such case. Can you?Continue reading »Posted in Op-eds | Also tagged brexit, economy and trade | 98 CommentsOf chocolate and jobsBy Cara Jenkinson | Fri 12th August 2016 - 12:15 pmLast month I visited York’s Chocolate Story, a visitor attraction in the centre of the city of York. A very lively tour guide told us about the Quakers who established the chocolate industry in York, and we saw how filled chocolates are made (and got to eat some) and made our own chocolate lollies (and got to eat them too). The other visitors included several grandparents, who seemed to be enjoying the experience at least as much as their grandchildren!As the UK population gets older, the leisure industry has observed that we are becoming far more interested in acquiring ‘cultural capital’. Since 2009 household spending on recreation and culture has risen faster than total household consumption (VisitEngland, 2013). Older people, whilst more numerous, are getting ‘younger’ wanting to undertake new experiences and acquire new knowledge and skills – whether it’s baking, gardening or learning about history or art.This creates new employment opportunities that we should be actively promoting. Rather than working in yet another retail mall, young people can acquire knowledge that they can then share. Enriching an older person’s life is far more rewarding than stacking shelves or driving a delivery van. Of course there are concerns that these will be low paid jobs. However older people, whose incomes have been protected most in the years since the recession are likely to be able and willing to pay, and indeed this could be a good transfer of cash from the old to the younger generation.Continue reading »Posted in News | Also tagged employment and older people | 16 CommentsLib Dem Jobwatch special: Last chance to apply for internship with ALDCBy The Voice | Sat 23rd July 2016 - 4:34 pmThe Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors and Campaigners is this party’s foremost authority on local campaigning.

This mirrors the diversity of modern families across Britain, where families come in all shapes and sizes, and reinforces my commitment to support and promote policies which enable each and every one of these families to balance work with bringing up their kids.I am proud of the coalition government’s record on job creation and bringing down unemployment – reflected in the latest statistics out last week which showed that unemployment had fallen to its lowest level in nearly six years – but recognise that there is still more for us to do to ensure that everyone is able to benefit from the economic upturn.This week, single parent charity Gingerbread has published a new report, Paying the Price: The long road to recovery, which highlights single parents’ experiences in work and of finding work. In reading the report, I was struck by how motivated single parents are to work and support their families – indeed 60% of single parents are already in work – a fact which is reinforced by the stories I hear from the single parents I meet at my constituency surgeries.Continue reading »Posted in Op-eds | Also tagged Single parents and stephen lloyd | 4 CommentsOpinion: The East Midlands would suffer without EuropeBy Issan Ghazni | Fri 21st March 2014 - 1:45 pmIf we needed reminding how vital Europe is to British jobs in regions like the East Midlands, the bosses of car giants Hyundai and Toyota spelt it out.As a European candidate in May’s elections I was alarmed to read that Hyundai, who have a base in Corby, warned against leaving the EU saying that if the UK were no longer in the single market it would throw up ‘barriers’ to doing business.

However, underneath the hyperbole lies a serious point; that the Calder Valley lies in a sweet spot for ease of commute to the major employment centres.But what the Calder Valley lacks – and what holds back prosperity and employment opportunities within it – is a modern, efficient transport system.We are cursed on the Caldervale line which runs along the Calder Valley…Continue reading »Posted in News | Also tagged calder valley, economy and transport | 14 CommentsGuy Verhofstadt writes… 2014 European elections and the challenge for LiberalsBy Guy Verhofstadt | Mon 13th January 2014 - 12:38 pmThis year’s European elections are bound to be a tough fight. Eurosceptics such as UKIP and the French National Front are determined to turn back the clock and tear down the internal market, stoking xenophobia and putting millions of jobs at risk. In the UK context, the Conservatives appear to want to throw in the towel and leave the EU, whilst Labour are still sitting uncomfortably on the fence. Only Lib Dems are clear where they stand as the party of In.Being the main pro-European party, across the EU, though does not mean defending the status quo.

I happen to be all three!In Government, our party has actively pursued policies that are enabling many people to benefit from work and to a greater extent, they are working! Almost one and a half million new private sector jobs have been created; a million new apprenticeships are getting our young people into work and Liberal Democrat policies are helping businesses grow with the £3.2 billion Regional Growth Fund.We have seen real results from core Liberal Democrat policies. The achievement I am most proud of so far is a subject I am passionate about. In fact, it is one of the issues that drew me back to politics: the dignity afforded to us by being in a job. The scar of benefit dependence that has built up over generations, alongside the apparently intractable problem of high youth unemployment, is something I have been keen to tackle, and have worked furiously on both locally in Eastbourne and nationally in Parliament.Continue reading »Posted in Op-eds | Also tagged apprenticeships and employment | 8 CommentsLiblink… Vince Cable: Europe is an anchor for British businessBy Joe Otten | Mon 4th November 2013 - 12:23 pmFor centuries, Britain has developed economically through being an open, outward-looking country.

The CBI, which represents some 240,000 businesses up and down the country, has published a landmark report in support of Britain’s EU membership. It found that 8 out of 10 of its members would vote to remain part of the EU, including 77% of small businesses, and concluded that the overall benefits of EU membership massively outweigh the costs. In fact, each of us is thought to be around £1225 better off a year thanks to …Continue reading »Posted in News | Also tagged european union | 23 CommentsPhil Bennion MEP writes: Manufacturers say Britain must stay in the EUBy Phil Bennion | Wed 16th October 2013 - 10:25 amOn Monday, the UK’s manufacturing sector gave us a clear message.
