And I’m not alone in that opinion, either. The U.S. Department of State has a long history of working against the best interests of the United States, consistently shilling for all things socialist. Those who have looked into tax-exempt foundations like the Carnegie Endowment, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Consortium, Guggenheim Fellowship, etc., and the subsequent investigation by the Reece Committee, might know what I’m talking about.The first U.S. Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, once said, “Consistency has never been a mark of stupidity. If the diplomats who have mishandled our relations with Russia were merely stupid, they would have occasionally made a mistake in our favor.”State Department Spokesperson Marie Harf recently told MSNBC’s Chris Matthews ISIS could be stopped if we could just create jobs for them.At first blush, for those ignorant of Marxist ideology, this sort of thinking seems preposterous. Well, I am strongly inclined to agree. But I digress.For dyed-in-the-wool Marxists and their fellow travelers (sympathizers), it makes perfect sense. This is why I believe it so important more Americans gain a better understanding of Marxism—since it is lauded and approved of by so many American universities and the liberal media, not to mention those in positions of power within our own government.Karl Marx believed our view of history needed to be changed (cf. “hope and change”). Cleon Skousen wrote in his book The Naked Communist about the central importance economics plays in the Marxian religion. Marx believed history should be changed to “a fixed, undeviating, pre-determined course of progress which could be charted in the past and predicted for the future on the basis of a single, simple criterion—economics.”According to Marx and his votaries, if we could only “level the playing field” by making everyone and everything the same (see “equality and fairness”), it would usher in a veritable utopia, i.e., the long hoped for “workers’ paradise.” Interestingly, about 90 percent of what Karl Marx wrote concerned economics (see Das Kapital).Well, let’s just get something straight: ISIS doesn’t give a damn about economics—quite the contrary. Their motivations and actions are not influenced by Marxism, per se, but rather the teachings of Muhammad, and a literal interpretation of the Koran and the Hadith.Although it should be noted that Marxism and Islam have quite a bit in a common.Until our government pulls its proverbial head out of its posterior region, and begins to address the Islamic ideology that fuels terrorist groups like ISIS, we will forever be beating our collective heads against the wall wondering why we are not getting anywhere, while the enemy runs roughshod over us and others. If you cannot define the enemy, you cannot defeat the enemy. How many times does it have to be said?Harf went on to make the patently absurd claim that “we cannot win this war by killing them [ISIS] … we cannot kill our way out of this war.”So why are we killing them? The whole purpose of war is to kill the enemy until they’re either all dead or they surrender unconditionally. Period.You just can’t make this stuff up.Of course this brings us to the all-important question: just whose team is the Obama Administration and the State Department playing for?This entry was posted in Constitution, Financial, History, Military, Politics, Religion, Survival, Terrorism and tagged Allah, Brent Parrish, Carnegie Endowment, Chris Matthews, Cleon Skousen, Communist, Das Kapital, Diplomats, Economics, Ford Foundation, Guggenheim Fellowship, Hadith, History, ISIS, Islam, James Forrestal, Jihad, Jobs, Karl Marx, Marie Harf, Marxist, Military, MSNBC, Muhammad, Muslims, Politics, Quran, Reece Committee, Rockefeller Consortium, Russia, Sharia Law, socialist, State Department, Terrorism, Terrorists, The Naked Communist, The Prophet, The Right Planet, US, War.

Now he is going to fight ISIS with our borders wide open and we should reward ISIS for human butchery around the world by giving them our jobs. ?This will discourage ISIS plans for a one world muslim Caliphate by further strengthening them how ?Comments are closed.Donate toNoisyRoom.netSupport American Values...Donate toNoisyRoom.netSupport American Values...Donate to My HusbandGarry Hamilton's Cancer FundGet your 2nd Amendment Shirts over at LibertasBellaEmail Us:[email protected]AdvertisingDon’t Tread on Me – What It Means Today----------------------- Subscribe for a daily email of articles featured on NoisyRoom...Enter your email address:Delivered by FeedBurnerPurchase at New ZealAvailable at Amazon.com on Kindle and in Paperback.This is the novel that conservatives have beendying for.SearchSearchCalendarFebruary 2015MTWTFSS12 3 4 5 6 7 89 10 11 12 13 14 1516 17 18 19 20 21 2223 24 25 26 27 28« Jan Mar »BlogrollAmmo.comAmmo.com Resistance LibraryCommon Cents BlogConscience of a ConservativeExposing Marxism in the ChurchFounders CodeFull Spectrum DominanceGulag BoundLarry CorreiaMatt BrackenMichelle Obama's MirrorMonster Hunter NationNew ZealOutdoor ReviewsPublius-HuldahRight Wing NewsSimply JewsThe American SpectatorThe Black Robe RegimentThe Jawa ReportThe People's CubeThe PointThe Religion of PeaceThe Soros FilesTheo SparkTrue The VoteTundra TabloidsVirginia Right!Vlad TepesVoice Of The CoptsArchivesArchives Select Month January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009CategoriesCategories Select Category 2nd Amendment American Revolution American Stuff Arlen Williams Arlene from Israel Authors Book Reviews Cliff Kincaid Constitution Denise Simon Dr. Ashraf Ramelah Financial Founding Fathers Garry Hamilton Gerald Loeffers History Illegal Immigration James Simpson Lloyd Marcus Military News Pandemics Politics Publius Huldah Question(s) of the Day Religion Renee Nal Survival T F Stern Taxation Terresa Monroe-Hamilton Terrorism Trapper Pettit Trevor Loudon UncategorizedMetaLog inEntries feedComments feedWordPress.orgRecent PostsTrump’s Silenced Majority – The Voiceless, Voteless, And Canceled Governed No Longer ConsentKeyWiki Weekly Profile – Kooper CarawayWasted LivesWho Knew About and Planned the “Insurrection?”States Begin to Push Back on Big Tech CensorshipRecent CommentsArlen Williams on FBI is Investigating a Mysterious PostcardTM1 on Profile In Courage Josh Hawley Fights For Trump vs. Cowardly Ben SasseSusan Blake on Defeating the New World OrderD3F1ANT on Govs Blocking Legislature Rights To Select Electors Face Federal LawsuitBen Colder on Ghislaine Maxwell and Her Husband Offer $28.5M Bail Package© 2021 NoisyRoom.net	| Proudly powered by WordPress | Theme: Skirmish by Blank Themes"
