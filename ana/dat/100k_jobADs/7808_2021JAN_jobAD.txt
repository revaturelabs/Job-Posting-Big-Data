As a workaround, refactor the option to not aggregate NULLs. – Paul White♦ Apr 24 '15 at 5:06add a comment |2 Answers 2Active Oldest Votes2Annoying isn't it. I've done some research and it turns out it is incorrectly reporting a ANSI warning as an error (resolved in SQL Server 2012, no patch available for previous versions).One way to stop the error is to go through all your code, and wherever you have an aggregate function (e.g. SUM), use ISNULL to ensure the aggregated value can never be NULL:i.e. changeSUM(Field1+Field2)toSUM(ISNULL(Field1,0)+ISNULL(Field2,0))This makes the error go away but might be impractical.ShareImprove this answerFollowedited Apr 24 '15 at 5:12Paul White♦58.5k1616 gold badges351351 silver badges535535 bronze badgesanswered Apr 24 '15 at 5:09Nick.McDermaidNick.McDermaid37222 silver badges1515 bronze badgesadd a comment |0This seems like you are running SSIS package through SQL agent job and error details are not accurate in your question,to know error details ,know name of package and run below queryuse ssisdb  go   select top 10* from catalog.event_messages ce  join  catalog.operations co  on co.operation_id=ce.operation_id  and co.object_name='your package name'  and ce.event_name='onerror'  order by co.operation_id descplease post the errorShareImprove this answerFollowedited Apr 24 '15 at 3:23user507answered Apr 24 '15 at 3:19TheGameiswarTheGameiswar2,77933 gold badges1818 silver badges4545 bronze badgesadd a comment |Your AnswerThanks for contributing an answer to Database Administrators Stack Exchange!Please be sure to answer the question.
