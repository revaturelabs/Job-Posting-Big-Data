More on that later.Aside from asking where to post and find DAM jobs, several people are asking what are typical DAM job descriptions. After presenting this information during a DAM Conference, here are parts of actual DAM job descriptions and knowledge shared by several DAM professionals on the job market today.This is part of the equation that involves people along with process and technology for DAM.While some people may use Digital Asset Management (DAM) sometimes within an organization, there is an increase in the need for people who may work full-time on DAM within an organization. We’ll explore several of these positions so you can have an idea of what some organizations have for talent and resources for those who do this type of work.Here is a part of a job description for a Digital Asset Manager:Responsible for leading overall strategy, implementation and workflow of the Digital Asset Management system for [organization]Acts as primary liaison between [organization] and various photo studios with regard to image names, new photography and archivingResponsible for assigning appropriate metadata for assets to ensure accurate usage rightsManages the Digital Asset system and facilitate the uploading of assets as well as maintaining and upgrading the systemRegisters internal and external users to the Digital Asset Management system based on permissionsFacilitates retrieval of previously cataloged images/shootsProcesses raw images using the appropriate softwareArchive assets as necessaryGenerates asset download reportsMaintains accurate procedures and records for the systemKeeps informed of latest Digital Asset Management technology trends and innovationsOther duties as identified and assignedWhat are we looking for when filling the human resources gap with people needed to help manage your organization’s digital assets? There are no hard and fast rules, but rather guidelines. Any of these could be staff or contractual positions:Administrator (DBA)ArchivistWith Digital, not just analog (print) experienceAnalystConsultantEither an internal, permanent staff for ongoing consultation OR an external (temporary), outside perspective looking in with a fresh viewpointAdvisor, coach and/or functional roleDigital Asset ManagerSupport DAM system and usersAn industry expert in the fieldDAM Specialist/CoordinatorOrganize and upload assetsMetatag assetsData Entry Specialist* (depending on volume)Engineer/Developer/Programmer/Information ArchitectHelp DeskInternTemporary position (more on this in a future blog post)Willingness to:Learn about DAMWork on metadata and taxonomyUpload assetsLibrarianWith Digital, not just analog (print/physical cataloging) experienceMetatagger (aka Metator, Cyberian)Project ManagerSalesTaxonomistWhat we call the position (job title) is less important than what they actually do.DAM professionals who communicate with management need to have an understanding of high level business needs and how DAM can meet those needs. Why? Because it is important to quantify:Cost savingsTime savingsReductions in risk (with knowledge of rights)Yes, Digital Asset Management is a business need, not just a technology or another database.If you are looking to hire a DAM professional, such as Digital Asset Manager, have potential candidates include their answers to the following questions as part of the job application:Have you worked with a Digital Asset Management System? Where? How long?How much experience do you have creating Metadata Schema?Do you have any training experience? What type?That should help gauge the level of experience of most candidates.Now about that “mind reader” job posting. Often, management and human resources do not know what DAM professionals are supposed to do (a bit difficult to write a job description that way), but they are slowly realizing there may be a need for Digital Asset Management and that is followed by realizing the need to fill a position with a DAM professional. That professional may be assigned (or volunteered) within the organization. The professional may be hired from the outside. Beside that, DAM professionals should use best practices and notice common behaviors when these practices are not followed.

I am a Digital Asset Manager.Besides, I forgot my mind reading hat at home.What is your DAM job description?AdministratorBusiness AnalystConsultantDAM ArchitectDAM Director/DAM Manager/Digital Asset ManagerDAM Specialist/CoordinatorDigital Archivist/LibrarianEngineer/Developer/ProgrammerInternProject ManagerTaxonomist/Metatagger (aka Metator)ShareEmailFacebookLinkedInTwitterMorePinterestPocketRedditWhatsAppTumblrTelegramPrintSkypeLike this:Like Loading...Categories: Career, Digital Asset Management | Tags: 2010, Career, DAM, DAM jobs, description, Digital Asset Management, Employment, get job, Henrik de Gyor, hiring, HR, job, job descriptions, Linkedin, position, Role, roles | Permalink.
