In this regard this 3.72 low becomes our new short-term risk parameter from which traders can effectively rebase and managed the risk of a still-advised bullish policy. Former 3.76-area resistance is considered new near-term support ahead of further gains.The daily log scale chart of the May contract above shows the extent and trendy, impulsive manner of the past month-and-a-half’s rally that are characteristic of the early stages of a major bull move. What we need to guard against and prepare for is an interim correction of this initial rally’s component of a broader base/reversal PROCESS. An admittedly short-term mo failure below a corrective low like 3.72 would warn of such a (2nd-wave) correction that could easily retrace 50% or more to the 3.66-area or below before the dramatic, explosive (3rd-wave) portion of the reversal higher kicks in.Here’s the intriguing rub however: on a weekly log active-continuation chart basis below, the base/reversal began from last Nov’s 3.36 low, with Dec-Jan’s setback from 3.61 to 3.45 arguably that (2nd-wave) correction that would suggest the market is CURRENTLY IN that dramatic 3rd-wave portion of the sequence. If correct, this market may not only NOT fail below even a short-term corrective low like 3.72, but ACCELERATE HIGHER straight away.There’s no question that the market has clearly broken the Jul’17 – Jan’18 downtrend. The only question is whether the current rally is “just another” intra-three-year-range hiccup ahead of another relapse OR the initial stage of….…THE dramatic, protracted reversal of the 2012 – 2016 secular bear trend similar to 3Q10’s explosive rally that followed similar multi-quarter bottoming/base/reversal price action that this market has again exhibited since Oct’14 shown in the monthly log scale chart below.These issues considered, a full and aggressive bullish policy and exposure remain advised with a failure below 3.72 required for shorter-term traders with tighter risk profiles to move to the sidelines to circumvent an interim correction and for longer-term players to perhaps pare bullish exposure to more conservative levels to preserve some dry powder for reloading at a preferred risk/reward level and condition. In lieu of at least such sub-3.72 weakness, further and possibly accelerated gains remain expected.ShareTweetRJO Market InsightsRJO Market Insights specializes in forward-thinking analysis, focused on potential market-moving events and dominant factors driving price discovery.
