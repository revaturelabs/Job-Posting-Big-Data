Enough is enough\".The university, the largest in London with 34,000 students, says the cutbacks are necessary as it needs to repay more than �36m after auditors found drop-out rates were higher than stated and that it had been overpaid since 2005.Most Readexpand_more More1 Ethnic communities not taking up Covid jabs, Tower Hamlets Mayor warns2 'Racist consultation' protest rejected on Tower Hamlets street closures as Labour sticks to its manifesto3 Airbnb house party violence leaves police officer with broken finger4 Council fined for Alexia Walenkaki's playground death in Mile End and says sorry to family5 Man sentenced after teenage boy groomed on Snapchat to sell heroin6 Police hunt after stabbing in Cable Street: One man hurt7 Streets around proposed Chinese embassy building could be renamed after persecuted Muslims8 Teenager found dead in Victoria Park9 No injuries but 20 rescued as firefighters tackle Limehouse blaze10 Police raid cannabis factory near Liverpool Street station: 2 arrestsA mass rally will be held at the main campus in Holloway Road from 1pm today.Become a SupporterThis newspaper has been a central part of community life for many years.
