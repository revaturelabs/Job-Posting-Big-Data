ProsperityAmericans for Prosperity, founded in 2004, is a libertarian conservative political advocacy group in the United States funded by David Koch and Charles Koch. As the Koch brothers' primary political advocacy group, it is one of the most influential American conservative organizations. After the 2009 inauguration of President Barack Obama, AFP helped transform the Tea Party movement into a political force. It organized significant opposition to Obama administration initiatives such as global warming regulation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the expansion of Medicaid and economic stimulus. It helped turn back cap and trade, the major environmental proposal of Obama's first term. AFP advocated for limits on the collective bargaining rights of public-sector trade unions and for right-to-work laws, and it opposed raising the federal minimum wage. AFP played an active role in the achievement of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives in 2010 and in the Senate in 2014. In the 2014 mid-term election cycle, AFP led all groups, other than political action committees, in spending on political television advertising. AFP's scope of operations has drawn comparisons to political parties. AFP, an educational social welfare organization, and the associated Americans for Prosperity Foundation, a public charity, are tax-exempt nonprofits. As a tax-exempt nonprofit, AFP is not legally required to disclose its donors to the general public. The extent of AFP's political activities while operating as a tax-exempt entity has raised concerns among some campaign finance watchdogs regarding the transparency of its funding.Total Jobs:11Total Experts:1Average Pay:$94,117Total value of jobs:$1,600,000% Masters:28%Learn More About Americans for Prosperity* Ladders EstimatesMore Jobs at Americans for ProsperityGrassroots Engagement Director$80K — $100KAmericans for Prosperity•Arlington, VA 222019 days agoGrassroots Engagement Director$80K — $100KAmericans for Prosperity•Wausau, WI 544019 days agoGrassroots Engagement Director$80K — $100KAmericans for Prosperity•Little Rock, AR 7220123 days agoGrassroots Engagement Director, Michigan$80K — $100KAmericans for Prosperity•Lansing, MI 4890923 days agoCommunity Engagement Director$80K — $100KAmericans for Prosperity•Arlington, VA 2220141 days agoSimilar JobsGrassroots Engagement Director, Michigan$80K — $100KAmericans for Prosperity•Lansing, MI 4890923 days agoGrassroots Engagement Director$80K — $100KAmericans for Prosperity•Arlington, VA 222019 days agoGrassroots Engagement Director$80K — $100KAmericans for Prosperity•Little Rock, AR 7220123 days agoEngagement Director$200K — $250KFCB Global•New York, NY 100014 days agoDirector of Engagement$150K — $200KVisiting Nurse Service of New York•New York, NY 10001TodayMore Education, Government & Non-Profit JobsChief Diversity OfficerStrategic Education, Inc.•RemoteTodayAccount Manager$80K — $140KFlorida Virtual School•RemoteTodayAccount Manager$80K — $120KFlorida Virtual School•Lebanon, TN 37087TodayAccount Manager$80K — $120KFlorida Virtual School•RemoteTodayLead Rails Developer$90K — $110KNew York, NY 10001YesterdayFind similar Director, Customer Engagement jobs:NationwideLansing, MINews & Career AdviceJob SearchThese are the 5 college majors that will make you a top earner for lifeCW HeadleyThese people will get hired in 2021Kyle Schnitzer4 digital tools that will help you stand out to recruitersBella WananaLegal Privacy Press & Media Work at LaddersHighest-Paying Jobs Highest-Paying Companies Highest-Paying Careers Highest-Paying Industries Cities & States Expert Network News & Career Advice DirectoryFAQs Member Help Recruiter Help Contact Us Unsubscribe© Ladders, Inc.Legal | Privacy | Press & Media | Work at LaddersHighest-Paying Jobs | Highest-Paying Companies | Highest-Paying Careers | Highest-Paying Industries | Cities & States | Expert Network | News & Career Advice DirectoryFAQs | Member Help | Recruiter Help | Contact Us | Unsubscribe© Ladders, Inc."
