The energy firm has committed to the Scottish Government initiative, which aims to ensure everyone aged between 16 and 24 has the opportunity of work, education or training.The Guarantee aims to give all young people in Scotland the chance to succeed despite the economic impacts of coronavirus. John Stewart, SSE’s Director of HR, took part in a launch call with Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop, as the scheme was unveiled.He said: “We’re committed to building a sustainable, green recovery from coronavirus – investing £7.5bn in low carbon projects across the UK and Ireland over the next five years – creating opportunity for jobs, the supply chain and communities. The sector is already facing a skills gap and we are committed to providing a pathway for young people to join us on the road to net zero whilst developing long-term careers in an exciting and growing industry where they are very much needed. We’re proud to back the Young Person’s Guarantee and give all young people in Scotland the chance to succeed despite the economic impacts of coronavirus.”SSE is among the first organisations to back Guarantee alongside the Scottish Government, Cap Gemini, NHS Lothian and Standard Life Aberdeen.Organisations backing the Guarantee make five pledges to help young people at this critical time:prepare young people for the world of work through work experience, volunteering and work-based learning opportunitiesengage with and provide opportunities to young people who face barriers to workcreate work-based learning, training and up-skilling opportunities for young peoplecreate jobs and opportunities for young people through apprenticeships, paid internships and work experiencecreate an inclusive workplace to support learning and enable young people to meet their potentialEconomy Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: “The pandemic is having a disproportionate economic effect on our young people, reducing job opportunities just as they are starting out on their careers. I am delighted to be launching the Young Person’s Guarantee today to help ensure their prospects are not permanently damaged. I want to thank the early trailblazers who have backed our ambitious initiative and recognise the importance of supporting our young people.“The leadership of employers from across Scotland and from all sectors will be key in providing the opportunities that will make this Guarantee a success. This employer leadership will build on our strong track record of tackling youth unemployment through our industry led Youth Employment Strategy – Developing the Young Workforce.“We are encouraging employers to come forward and join what is a crucial intervention to ensure that we capture the potential of our young people and prevent coronavirus leaving a lasting impact on the employment opportunities of our future workforce. I want Scotland’s young people to know we are right behind you, we want you to be successful and we will do everything we can to give you the opportunities you need.”Sandy Begbie, who led the Scottish Government’s Developing the Young Workforce Group, said: “In the spring, I was delighted to be asked to develop a strategy to establish a Young Person Guarantee for all 16 to 24-year-olds in Scotland. The ambition is clear, I want every young person who is unemployed to be given an opportunity for a job, apprenticeship, education, training or volunteering. I strongly believe we must act now and decisively, our young people are an asset and a credit to Scotland.”By Hr NETWORK News|2020-11-06T08:23:31+00:00November 6th, 2020|Graduates, News, Social Inclusion|0 CommentsShare This Story, Choose Your Platform!FacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailLeave A Comment Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment.Hr NETWORK Magazine and Hr MARKETHr MARKET is our latest addition to the Hr NETWORK family.
