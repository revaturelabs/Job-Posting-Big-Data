This comes only a few weeks after another great beer from St. Austell – the “Big Job” – was named ‘Supreme National Champion Bottled Beer’ at the SIBA beer awards.SIBA is the Society of Independent Brewers which is the Trade Organisation of over 800 independent brewers in the UK, large and small, who represent the best of British Brewing. Big Job won against 150 beers at the finals of the beer tasting but there were many hundreds more that were tasted regionally before the finals.“These accolades are a clear recognition of the excellent qualities of St Austell beers,” commented Pierre Stafrace, General Manager of Farsons Beverage Imports Company Limited (FBIC) which represents St Austell in Malta. “We are very proud to bring to Malta’s appreciative beer consumers the range of St Austell beers, which includes Admiral’s Ale, Tribute and Tribute Extra, apart from Proper Job and Big Job”.St Austell beers are available at Farsonsdirect in Mriehel and in selected bars in Malta and Gozo.FBIC is a member of the Farsons Group.Additional Info:Proper Job is an authentic IPA brewed with Cornish spring water and malt made from a blend of malts including Cornish grown Maris Otter barley. A powerfully hopped golden bitter that explodes with citrus grapefruit flavours. Served chilled, Proper Job is a refreshing barbeque drink which is fantastic with marinaded meats, burgers and flame grilled sausages. 5.5% ABVBig Job is a BIG beer, dry as a bone and jammed full of Cornish barley and Citra and Centennial hops. It’s not subtle, but it’s just the Job for those who love the taste of big, powerful hops. 7.2% ABVAdmiral's Ale was first brewed in 2005 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar. Brewed with a blend of Celeia hops for citrus and Cascade for spice, it is truly the Christmas pudding of beers. 5.0% ABVTribute is a Pale Ale and the favourite beer of customers and publicans throughout Cornwall. It is light, hoppy, zesty, easy to drink and consistently delicious. 4.2% ABVTribute Extra is an extra special version of Cornwall's favourite beer.
