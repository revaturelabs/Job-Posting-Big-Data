"Computational Complexity: University of Maryland Job Posting Mentions Quantum Computing explicitly!Computational ComplexityComputational Complexity and other fun stuff in math and computer science from Lance Fortnow and Bill GasarchMonday, October 28, 2013University of Maryland Job Posting Mentions Quantum Computing explicitly!The University of Maryland at College Park has its job posting up (its been up for a while). You can look at it here. I It lists THREE areas but says that they will take applicants from any area. This is believable since they only listed three. Had they listed (say) seven then I would not believe they are looking at other areas. What is the X such that if they list X then you believe they will take from other areas but if you list X+1 then you don't?The three areas listed are:CybersecurityQuantum ComputingNatural Lang. Proc.All three of these seem more particular than I usually see in job postings. That is, I've seen things like Systems, Theory, AI. SO- is this unusual? I don't quite know--- I haven't been on the market for a long time.Posted by GASARCH at 7:38 PMEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest4 comments:Anonymous 11:21 PM, October 28, 2013I think you have it backward. I think if they list a lot of areas then they are likely to accept other areas too, because they are just listing whatever areas come to mind without much thought, while if they list a small number of areas then they are unlikely to accept other areas because they actually have thought about it.ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyGASARCH 11:27 PM, October 28, 2013I happen to know that Univ of MD really will take applicants from many areas; however,your point is valid in another sense--- its hard to know if a school really will based on the number of areas listed. The thought process could be what you say, OR it couldbe that they just want to emphasize a few areas but really will take in others.ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous 11:26 AM, October 29, 2013Most areas in job listings are very specific, with broad areas like systems or theory much less common. I think it discourages good applicants unnecessarily. Who really needs a professor in computational game theory specifically versus a theorist more generally?ReplyDeleteRepliesUnknown 6:02 PM, October 30, 2013A CS department with a game theory lab.Think of it in terms of medicine. Would you prefer a top heart surgeon or a credible brain surgeon to perform your brain surgery?Grants are based on very specific proposals, which give rise to specific researcher needs in a lab, which already has picked a CS sub-area. Rare is the talent that can match years of experience, after all.DeleteRepliesReplyReplyAdd commentLoad more...Newer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)Tweets by @fortnowBooksCommissions earned from Amazon LinksBlog LinksBill's Home PageLance's Home PageVideosPodcastsPosts FeedComments FeedFoundations of Complexity LessonsThe Golden TicketP v NP SurveyFavorite TheoremsFavorite Complexity Books (commissions earned)CACM Conference ViewpointGraduate Student GuideBublup Rollup on P v NPPopular PostsAlan Selman (1941-2021)2020 Fall Jobs PostDr Jill BidenThe ACM History Committee call for proposals looks wrongComplexity Year in Review 20202019 Fall Jobs PostMy Survey on Hilbert's 10th for particular (d,n) is ready for you to help me on!The Ethics BoardSlowest Sorting AlgorithmsPresidential Quiz: Three ways to take itComplexity LinksComplexity ConferenceSIGACTTheory AnnouncementsTheory Stack ExchangeComplexity ZooComplexity on arXivElectronic Colloquium on Computational ComplexityParberry Referee and Speaker's GuidesSearch This BlogBlog Archive► 2021 (6)► January (6)► 2020 (76)► December (8)► November (7)► October (7)► September (7)► August (6)► July (6)► June (6)► May (7)► April (7)► March (9)► February (1)► January (5)► 2019 (84)► December (4)► November (3)► October (8)► September (7)► August (2)► July (8)► June (9)► May (9)► April (9)► March (8)► February (8)► January (9)► 2018 (100)► December (7)► November (8)► October (10)► September (8)► August (9)► July (8)► June (8)► May (9)► April (9)► March (8)► February (8)► January (8)► 2017 (102)► December (7)► November (8)► October (9)► September (8)► August (9)► July (9)► June (9)► May (9)► April (9)► March (8)► February (8)► January (9)► 2016 (102)► December (9)► November (8)► October (9)► September (7)► August (8)► July (7)► June (10)► May (9)► April (10)► March (8)► February (9)► January (8)► 2015 (103)► December (7)► November (9)► October (9)► September (8)► August (9)► July (9)► June (10)► May (8)► April (9)► March (9)► February (8)► January (8)► 2014 (111)► December (8)► November (8)► October (10)► September (11)► August (9)► July (9)► June (11)► May (10)► April (10)► March (8)► February (8)► January (9)▼ 2013 (108)► December (9)► November (8)▼ October (8)University of Maryland Job Posting Mentions Quantu...Science and HumanitiesTeaching without a net2013 Fall Jobs PostWho controls what is taught- the dept or the stude...Shut DownP vs NP is Elementary?
