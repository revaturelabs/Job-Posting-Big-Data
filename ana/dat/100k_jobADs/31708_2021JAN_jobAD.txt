Quit! Go find something meaningful for you because this is not by any stretch of imagination your place, Farnoosh!In fact, you could not be more of a misfit here if you were a dinosaur or an alien from planet Pluto. So get the hell out of here and never ever show your face again at a corporate place as an employee!It is just not for you, woman! You have too much to offer, we just don’t know what to do with you!”Yeeeeeeah!I only wish someone had loved me and cared about me that much to shake my world and my body if need be out of that crazy stupor of a fog. I wish someone had seen this brutal truth about me because I surely did not see it. Sigh. I wish. But you know what? No one did. Not. One. Single. Person. Not. Once.But I was mistaken to even expect this to happen. No boss, supervisor, manager, peer, friend or co-worker is looking out for YOUR career.Your managers or supervisors are not there to make sure you are doing what’s right for you but rather that you are a good fit for the team and the project and that you are doing what’s right for the company. So don’t ever expect anyone to look out for your career. No one can know, as best as you do, how you can achieve your fullest potential!I know, it’s no picnic to hear this but I love you, my dear readers, THAT much to tell you the harsh reality. Don’t get me wrong, the managers and bosses can be very nice people – well, except when they are not but I digress from my positive point again!!! – anyway, they can care about your well-being and your ability to do your job and some of them can become really good friends. In fact, I had a few awesome managers and will always miss them.So yeah, no one is looking out for your career, my dear, except you!You can take care of your own career, and pave the path to precisely the place of work that you can thrive and prosper by always having a plan.And when you find yourself in a dead-end job with nowhere to go and grow, and a job that brings you less fulfillment and more misery, then you need an exit strategy to professionally move out of that position and into a place where you can thrive.How on earth do you build an exit strategy?Well, a few ways.You can figure it out on your own. You can get yourself a wonderful coach. Or you can come hither and I will show you step-by-step how to build the smartest exit strategy that can not only pave your way out of that wrong place but also show you where you can belong and thrive.That’s where magic will happen. Or things that seem like magic to you because your role models and successful people are doing it and you keep wondering how. Those people are where they belong, playing to their strengths and knowing exactly what gifts they can offer. Over and over and over.Practice makes them look like perfectionists and their abilities come across as art and genius.Yours can too. But none of this can happen when you are in the wrong job, so let’s take care of that first, shall we?Well, what do you know, I created a course on exactly how you can build a smart exit plan to the place where you are meant to be in your professional life! Think I am a wee bit passionate about this? You bet right, baby! Now let’s see what we can do for you.I am opening early registration to The Smart Exit Blueprint course today. It is available at a super early rate for a few hours. The course is set to begin on February 20th. I will hold you accountable to the very end and you will be holding that smart exit blueprint in your hand, ready for execution when you “walk out” of my classroom.Now that’s a bold promise. Are you ready to make yourself such a promise?Is your professional life and essentially, your fulfillment in the work that you do in this lifetime worth that promise?You decide!But please know that you are not alone, and this is a tremendous step to take, I know, but one that you need to do sooner than later, and I am here if you have questions.
