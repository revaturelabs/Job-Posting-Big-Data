We have worked at the staffing agencies who required a retainer, as well as the contingent firms. We have worked employment advertising on the web, as well as print advertising. (Remember that?).Our team’s goal is to make it as easy as possible for employers to have all of their jobs available to the masses.In our experiences, we have found that job seekers want a clear-cut way to get the information that they want on available jobs as simple as possible. We know they don’t want to do a “search” that gives them unlimited answers, but have to click through an excessive amount of web pages to find what they thought was what they are looking for. Hospital Job Searches gives job seekers the information they are looking for quickly and easily.© 2017 Myalyn Marketing Associates, LLC DBA Hospital Job Searches . All Rights Reserved."
