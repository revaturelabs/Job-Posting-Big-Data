That translates to a jobless rate of 6.7 per cent. Still, Lehman notes the rate in Barrie is still well below the provincial and national averages ) the federal rate rose last month to 7.3 per cent). Lehman also points out, “We also have one of the highest participation rates in Canada, that’s the percentage of the population that is in the workforce. That is a measure of economic strength and shows we continue to be one of Canada’s hardest working cities.”Related postsEVERY DATE FOR THE NEXT WEEK IS A PALINDROMEFEELING LONELY?
