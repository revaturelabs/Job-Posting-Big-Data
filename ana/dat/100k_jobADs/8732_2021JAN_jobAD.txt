I am also adding other opportunities to the fleet of driving on a personal and business level. Hello and welcome to an idea for everyone who wants to be independent and in control of their own destiny. My name is Francis A. Casner Jr. I am an OTR (Over the Road) Truck driver who started driving 30 years ago and I have faced all the same challenges most of us are or have faced just trying to get a head. In 2016 after taking a long look at my life I wasn’t happy where I was going, nothing to look forward to in the future and everything was looking back, so in 2017 I decided to make a change, I’m going back to Truck driving and the dream began.We are a small fleet with 1 owner starting out with 1 truck and with the sky being the limit for growth, I will be adding 2 more trucks/drivers to our fleet as positions become available.ContactAddress:3209 Jan Dr. Orlando, FL 32806Phone: +1 407-307-4786Email: fcasner@wlpcexpress.comWebsite: www.wlpcexpress.comBlog Feed.Hello world!Job InquiryContact UsShop2019 © WLPC EXPRESS, INC"
