This applies to the places we work in, the things we use at work, as well as to how we design organisational structures, roles and tasks.”A Safe Work Australia initiative under the Australian Work Health and Safety Strategy 2012–2022 and led by Comcare and WorkCover Queensland, the handbook contains information about the ten principles of good work design and how they can be applied to any workplace, business or industry.Principles of Good Work Design is a ‘living’ electronic document that will be updated regularly with links to case studies and practical examples from businesses that have successfully applied the good work design principles.“The handbook complements a range of existing resources available to businesses and work health and safety professionals,” said Ms Baxter.“Failure to consider how work is designed can result in poor risk management and lost opportunities to innovate and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of work.Good work design can radically transform the workplace in ways that benefit the business, workers and clients.”Principles of Good Work Design is available on the Safe Work Australia website.Recommend on FacebookShare on LinkedinTweet about itSubscribe to the comments on this postTell a friendPOSTOREDITYOUR LISTINGCREATE AJOB SEEKER PROFILEContact us | Advertise with Us | About Winetitles Media | Privacy | Career | Opportunities | SitemapCopyright © Winetitles Media (Division of Provincial Press Group | All Rights Reserved.follow:Become my Facebook friendConnect with meSee new jobs on Twitter"
