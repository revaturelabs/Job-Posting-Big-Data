Some of these include Rawson’s, Pam Golding or Seeff, which are all South African franchises. There are however also international franchises operating in South Africa such as Remax and the new kid on the block, Keller Williams Ignite.The principle or owner of the franchise will be looking for diligent, honest, forward thinking employees to help run their business. Keep this in mind when you are looking for that perfect place to settle down and begin your exciting new career.Here are some tips for landing your first Job as an Estate Agent:Have a Good MindsetYour prospective boss is going to be looking for people that he can rely on to keep the best interests of the business at heart. You will want to project a sense of responsibility and commitment, so that your prospective employer will recognise those qualities.Understand the Job DescriptionMake sure you understand the job description. You don’t want to be applying for a position that at the end of the day is not for you. There are many functions of a real estate agent and you should be able to fulfil everything that the job description requires.Much of your practical internship work and your online estate agent learning should prepare you for most positions in an agency.What to Expect in Interviews & How to PrepareYou have already submitted your CV outlining all your experience and coursework. Now you will find yourself face to face with your new boss in an interview. Bear in mind that he has read your CV and is now not only listening to your answers to his questions, but also watching your body language closely.You might also have to go through several interviews with different partners of the business.John Lees, author of The Interview Expert: How to Get the Job You Want, suggests you develop a real script in preparation for your interview. You can probably predict a number of questions that you’ll be asked such as Why should we hire you? Why do you fit this role? I notice some gaps in your resume … Think about how you’ll answer these questions and practice saying the answers out loud.John also suggests you prepare for questions you want to avoid by developing short, upbeat answers. If you’re asked something that throws you for a loop, ask for a minute to think about how you’ll answer. Also, make sure you’re actually listening to the interviewer.Read What You Should (and Shouldn’t) Focus on Before a Job Interview for more great interview tips and advice from John.Embrace Your New Workplace & Follow InstructionsIf you get the job you will now most likely have to go through training period. You might find this frustrating as you are probably raring to get going. Things will probably be a lot different than your internship. Be open-minded and embrace the way your new workplace is run. Try to keep to instructions and make sure that you are clear on all directives.This will ensure that you will be able to do the best job you possibly can.Once you have qualified as a full status estate agent, you will have fulfilled the Services SETA requirement, the EAAB examination, your (online) estate agent course work and your internship. All these as well as a new position at a good agency should be the springboard you need to start you off on a successful career as a real estate agent.If you have any questions about finding a job as an estate agent, or you have any tips and advice that have worked for you in the past, please share them in the comments below.Tags: Tips for Real Estate AgentsShare this entryShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare on PinterestShare on LinkedInShare on TumblrShare on VkShare on RedditShare by Mailhttps://www.propacademy.co.za/v1/wp-content/uploads/New-Real-Estate-Agent-Job.jpg 442 300 PropAcademy https://www.propacademy.co.za/images/logo-WP-116.png PropAcademy2015-12-01 04:08:472020-11-10 09:21:37How to Find a Job at a Top Real Estate AgencyYou might also likeHow to Own Your Own Real Estate Agency in South AfricaProven Tips for the Successful Real Estate AgentHow to Qualify as a Full Status or Principal Real Estate AgentHow to Prepare for your Online Real Estate CourseDifferences Between the Old and New Property Practitioners Act2 repliesSikhulule Mdingana says:August 25, 2019 at 1:31 amHello there!I would like to become a real estate agent, I have applied to a few companies for internship. Now I read on a post on this site that I need to also take online courses. Is it necessary if I am accepted by an agency, will the agency not assist with the POE ?ReplyCourtney says:August 27, 2019 at 5:29 amHello SikhululeThis all depends on which agency you join as every agency has its own internal procedures. If they do not assist you with your Logbook PoE, then you can purchase our course, which covers all knowledge and projects, as well as assistance on putting your PoE together. The NQF4 course is however needed through a training provider, like ourselves. If you need further assistance, please submit your details on the contact us page and we will call you. Good luck, looking forward to assisting you!ReplyLeave a ReplyWant to join the discussion?Feel free to contribute!Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
