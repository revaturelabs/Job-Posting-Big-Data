I applied a coat of clear and then a coat with PWP’s Red Crystal Pearl pigment (ghost pearl) followed by several clear coats, light sanding between coats. I finished with a final color sand and very light rubbing compound. Added some striping and rebuilt the working pieces. I ride it regularly, though not as often during hot weather (95°+).I’m a 67 year old disabled Viet Nam veteran on a limited budget, so I appreciate your company’s affordable product line. My good friend, Frank Amiano, told me about your site and products and encouraged me to check it out before I decided on how to proceed on repainting my bike, glad I took his advice as I am now a fan of Paint With Pearl!Peggy and Richard GrahnBuy Black GunmetalAbout Paint With PearlWe at Paint With Pearl appreciate all of our customers who take the time to send us pictures and feedback on all of our products.
