Next is to keep them invigorated and involved.Employee retention is one of the principal measures, potentially a lead indicator, for the growth aspirations of an organisation. In a hyper-competitive marketplace for talent, especially in industries such as e-commerce, employees tend to change organisations swiftly. In this context, talent retention becomes a strategic priority for the corporate. While salaries, work hours, work environment, career growth and personal development are some of the factors that drive job changes, to achieve sustainable growth, organisations must drive employee engagement at the core. Engaged employees have a high degree of belonging (to the organisation and the “cause”), are focused, productive, creative, and importantly happy, elements integral to success for every corporate. Engaged employees also build longer careers with an organisation, resulting in lower attrition rates and higher performance levels. This also means that hidden costs of attrition are lower.Employees want to understand how an organisation can foster their personal and professional growth and facilitate their holistic development. Much like the phrase “dress for the job you want”- they want to be in an environment that offers them the opportunity to perform at their best.Businesses today cater to the above in various ways. They are increasingly looking to create more holistic workplaces, a sense of belonging, reinforcement policies and an open culture is central to the retention program. Supported by the reward and recognition programs, enhances the entire process. Workspace design is one of the most understated and under-utilised tools for creating effective teams. When crafting a contemporary workplace, one needs to go beyond the generic boardroom and open-plan office to motivate their employees and offer a feel-good-factor at work. At Yatra, our workspaces have been designed keeping in mind our brand values, the customer experience we aspire to create and the employee promise we offer. You will find inspiring travel and cultural iconography at our workspaces, diverse teams seated together, and lots of space for discussions. It is not surprising to often find members of different businesses interacting with each other brainstorming on new ideas or coming together to find \"hacks\". This is especially important with millennials driving the majority workforce for whom it is imperative to seek opportunities that challenge their potential. They have very different aspirations and expectations and are looking at experience rather than engagement. It is becoming essential for the leadership to handle these expectations as well as making engagement more meaningful by focusing on the following pillars - create a sense of achievement, contribute to a “legacy”, have a positive impact on people including but not limited to creating happiness! .There are no dos and don’ts to bridging the talent gap. Development cycles have become so accelerated that skills quickly peak in terms of demand and then settle into a sense of equilibrium. Companies need to essentially realise that there are no shortcuts to talent retention. And an oft overlooked aspect is the core employee promise. At Yatra, our \"talent promise\" focuses on the following - \"Freedom with Responsibility\", \"Speed using Judgement\", \"Catalyst for Change\" and \"Collective Achievement\". And a common thread through all of these Leadership states is humility and the need to constantly re-invent ourselves.When you have stars, do everything you can to keep them.The author is Chief Business Officer - Activities and Chief People Officer, Yatra.com.Add Comment()Comments ()Characters Remaining: 3000SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmailOR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATIONXSort By: NewestOldestDiscussedUp VotedDown VotedBe the first one to comment.We have sent you a verification email.
