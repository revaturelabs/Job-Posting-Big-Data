Mammographers—also called “mammography technicians” or “mammography technologists”—use specialized low-radiation X-ray machines to produce pictures of internal breast structures. They prepare patients for examinations and operate equipment precisely to deliver a clear image. They must be familiar with the equipment (and related software) as well as able to interpret the resulting images to identify any problems or abnormalities.Because patients often feel nervous or uncomfortable during the mammogram, mammographers must be empathetic, compassionate, and reassuring. They should also have effective administrative skills, as they must track and maintain records for all procedures.Search Mammographer JobsAll CT Technologist / Technician Director / Manager of Radiology / Imaging Dosimetrist Echocardiography Technologist / Technician Mammographer MRI Technologist / Technician Nuclear Medicine Technologist / Technician PET Technologist / Technician Radiation Oncologist Radiation Physicists Radiation Therapist Radiologic Technologist / Technician Radiologist Radiology / Imaging Supervisor / Lead Radiology Nurse Sonographer / Ultrasonographer Special Procedures or Vascular Technologist / Technician1-15 of 24 JobsLead MammographerEagles Landing Family Practice - Stockbridge, GAdiagnostic study Must be skilled in 3-D Mammography Previous experience with MQSA, FDA inspections, and QC on machines required Perform a variety of standard mammography procedures with emphasis on...1 day agoMammographerAll Medical Personnel - Stockbridge, GAPosition: Mammographer Location: Stockbridge, GA Shift: M-F 8 am to 5 pm ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS Mammography Job Function and Required Experience • 2 yrs. of current experience as Registered Mammography...Quick Apply1 hour agoMammographer Technician Travel (Atlanta,GA)HealthCare Traveler (Allied Health) - Atlanta, GA (17 miles from Stockbridge, GA)The perfect Vascular Ultrasound Technician Job awaits....7 hours agoMammography TechnologistDMS - Digital Mammography Specialists - Conyers, GA 30013, GA (13 miles from Stockbridge, GA)The mammography technologist will perform exams, specific to the breast, to help in the diagnosis and treatment of breast disease in patients....Quick Apply14 days agoMammography Technologist II, Tues - Thurs 10A - 7A - 30P InDekalb Medical Group - Decatur, GA (16 miles from Stockbridge, GA)Mammography Technologist II, Tues-Thurs 10a-6:30p, Sat 7a-3:30p in Decatur, Georgia | Careers at EHC - Dekalb Mammography Technologist II, Tues-Thurs 10a-6:30p, Sat 7a-3:30pDivision Emory Decatur HospitalCampus...16 days agoMammography Technologist, Prn, In , Careers At 's HospitalDekalb Medical Group - Atlanta, GA (17 miles from Stockbridge, GA)Mammography Technologist, PRN, 8:30a - 5p in Atlanta, Georgia | Careers at Emory Saint Joseph's Hospital Mammography Technologist, PRN, 8:30a - 5pDivision St....29 days agoMammography TechnicianAtlanta, GA (17 miles from Stockbridge, GA)Job Information Georgia Employer MAMMOGRAPHY TECH in Atlanta, Georgia Position DescriptionThe Mammography Technologist I will be responsible for operating mammography equipment to acquire or produce...30+ days agoMammography Tech, PT Days (including Saturdays), Piedmont FayettePiedmont Healthcare - Fayetteville, GA (17 miles from Stockbridge, GA)MINIMUM EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: One (1) year minimum experience as a Mammography Technologist preferred.
