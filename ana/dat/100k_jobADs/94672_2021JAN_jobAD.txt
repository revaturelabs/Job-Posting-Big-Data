Tock | Sep 6, 2017 | Domestic ViolenceFacing allegations of violence and abuse can be a stressful and daunting process. Those accused of similar crimes may find it beneficial to prepare for legal proceedings by focusing on their defense. A 61-year-old man in New York has recently lost his job after he was arrested and accused of domestic violence for the second time in the past 10 months.Authorities claim the incident occurred on a recent Sunday, and involved a female acquaintance of the man in question. The woman was allegedly injured in the process, and the man was taken into custody on misdemeanor domestic violence charges before being released. According to reports, he was also accused of a similar offense 10 months prior, where he allegedly choked another individual and held her against her will.It is unclear if he was convicted on the previous charges, but he was suspended from work for a short period after being arrested. Following the charges recently brought against him, he has reportedly lost his job within the correctional facility. If convicted, he would face severe penalties that could affect his life in various ways, and he may also have trouble obtaining employment within a similar field in the future.Those accused of domestic violence may find the subsequent process to be intimidating, and seeking guidance early on could be advisable. By speaking with an attorney, a client in New York could obtain advice on making informed decisions throughout the process. An attorney can thoroughly examine the situation and assist a client in forming a strong defense for use during court proceedings.Source: timesunion.com, “Second domestic violence arrest for state prison union VP“, Aug. 28, 2017FacebookTwitterLinkedInCategoriesCriminal Defense (34)Domestic Violence (14)Drug Charges (81)Drunk Driving (54)Dwi (42)Estate Planning (26)Felonies (86)Motor Vehicle Accidents (42)Sex Crimes (29)Uncategorized (53)ArchivesJanuary 2021 (1)December 2020 (7)November 2020 (3)October 2020 (6)September 2020 (5)August 2020 (5)July 2020 (6)June 2020 (5)May 2020 (6)April 2020 (5)March 2020 (5)February 2020 (5)January 2020 (7)December 2019 (5)November 2019 (5)October 2019 (6)September 2019 (5)August 2019 (6)July 2019 (5)June 2019 (5)May 2019 (5)April 2019 (6)March 2019 (6)February 2019 (4)January 2019 (6)December 2018 (5)November 2018 (6)October 2018 (5)September 2018 (5)August 2018 (6)July 2018 (5)June 2018 (18)May 2018 (17)April 2018 (9)March 2018 (5)February 2018 (5)January 2018 (4)December 2017 (4)November 2017 (5)October 2017 (4)September 2017 (4)August 2017 (4)July 2017 (5)June 2017 (4)May 2017 (5)April 2017 (4)March 2017 (4)February 2017 (4)January 2017 (5)December 2016 (4)November 2016 (4)October 2016 (5)September 2016 (4)August 2016 (5)July 2016 (5)June 2016 (4)May 2016 (4)April 2016 (4)March 2016 (5)February 2016 (4)January 2016 (4)December 2015 (5)November 2015 (4)October 2015 (4)September 2015 (6)August 2015 (4)July 2015 (3)June 2015 (5)May 2015 (4)April 2015 (3)March 2015 (5)February 2015 (4)January 2015 (5)December 2014 (4)November 2014 (4)October 2014 (5)September 2014 (4)August 2014 (4)July 2014 (5)June 2014 (4)May 2014 (5)April 2014 (4)March 2014 (4)February 2014 (4)January 2014 (4)December 2013 (5)November 2013 (5)October 2013 (4)September 2013 (4)August 2013 (4)July 2013 (5)June 2013 (4)May 2013 (3)Recent PostsFatal car accident claims 5 livesNew York Woman charged with DWI following traffic stopRevocable or irrevocable trust: Which should you choose?Pedestrian crash in Manhattan claims 1 lifeNew York car crash claims 1 life, injures 3 othersSubscribe To This Blog’s FeedGet Answers From An Experienced AttorneyEmail Us For A Response963 Route 6Mahopac, NY 10541Mahopac Law Office MapReview UsPhone: 845-208-5995Fax: 845-628-5450© 2021 Law Offices of Joseph J.
