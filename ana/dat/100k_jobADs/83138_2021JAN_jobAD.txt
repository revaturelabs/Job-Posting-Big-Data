Network engineers (or network architects) work with a wide range of network sizes and types, including local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and intranets. This career requires strong knowledge of a company’s business plans when designing the system’s layout and ensuring the network is situated to best meet the organization’s goals. They are also responsible for establishing what hardware is needed and determining how it will be placed around the logical network, including offsite locations.Network engineers manage previously established networks as well, though this consumes significantly less of their time than planning new ones. When flaws in the security system are discovered, they employ patches and other remedial measures to repair these weaknesses. Additionally, they use data regarding current traffic to predict whether any changes will be necessary to maintain functionality.Search Network Engineer JobsAll Business Intelligence Analyst Configuration Management Specialist Data Scientist / Architect Database Administrator / Developer DevOps Engineer / System Administrator Help Desk Manager Help Desk Technician / Analyst Information Security Analyst / Architect IT Executive Network Engineer Network Security Engineer Product Manager Project Manager Quality Assurance Engineer / Analyst Quality Assurance Team Lead / Manager Software Architect Software Developer Software Developer - Embedded Software Developer - Mobile Software Developer - Web / Front End Software Release Manager Software Team Lead / Manager Technical Writer User Experience Designer1-15 of 190 JobsNetwork EngineerCaresoft - Dallas, TX (12 miles from Addison, TX)Skills Required: Experience as Network Engineer.
