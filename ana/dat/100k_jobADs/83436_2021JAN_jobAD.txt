I guess my concern is if it will affect my current job. I have a top secret clerance now but I've never taken a poly.I don't think it will, I just redid my TS clearance earlier this year as well but like you I wasn't polygraphedCommentPostCancelbuis02Forum MemberJoin Date: Nov 2011Posts: 155ShareTweet#2782712-13-2011, 04:44 PMOriginally posted by yoda View PostThat's just for the NOR... once you get the TO you're good to go.Didn't know that... Thanks for the heads up Yoda!Originally posted by cfalco View PostI just got an E-mail congratulating me on passing my PFT 1 from over a month ago. Is this just an automatic e-mail sent out after a certain period after passing your first physical or does this mean I should expect my PFT 2 soon?At least you got an e-mail lol. I didn't get anything. I just got the green check in CASS a few weeks after and that was about it. Does the PFT2 come after the call?Last edited by buis02; 12-13-2011, 04:49 PM.CBPOGEO Pref: SWBApp Date: 8/2/11Written Exam: 9/1/11NOR (Rating: 85, no vet pref, GS-5/7): 9/29/11TSL submitted: 10/12/11 (faxed & mailed)E-Qip submitted: 10/14/11SF86 submitted: 10/25/11PFT1: 11/8/11 (cleared CASS 12/1/11)Med: 11/8/11 (cleared CASS 12/8/11)BI: 11/15/11 (cleared CASS 12/8/11)VBT/SI: 12/7/11 (cleared CASS 12/15/11)DT: 12/9/11 (cleared CASS 12/20/11)Referred to Schedule EOD 12/15/11Call Rec.: 3/2/12PFT2: 3/16/12EOD: 4/9/12FLETC: 5/11/12 - 9/17/12CommentPostCancelDSgirlCAForum MemberJoin Date: Dec 2011Posts: 103ShareTweet#2782812-13-2011, 05:01 PMposted in errorExam: 12/10 (for West Coast)Reapplied: 7/11 (for SWB)TSL: 10/28/11 (SWB)PFT1: 12/2/11 (passed)Medical: 12/2/11 (passed)VBT & S.I.: 1/10/12 (passed)B.I.: 3/19/12 met with BI (in security office)Qualifications: 3/22/12 (cleared)Drug Test: 5/17/2012 (cleared)PFT2: ?CommentPostCancelDSgirlCAForum MemberJoin Date: Dec 2011Posts: 103ShareTweet#2782912-13-2011, 05:08 PMOriginally posted by DIGG7ER View PostHey guys, I'm new on the site and have a couple of questions. I changed my Geo preference in late October and have been given a TO, I've already done the medical/pft1, vbt/si, and I'm just waiting for my BI to clear. I switched to swb and my question is if they let you choose where to be stationed at? I'm hoping for San Diego and will gladly wait until it opens but will they allow me to wait? ThanksI asked the same question. If you at least get to select a preference and they said no. She said you would get the location that has funding when your turn comes up. She said there is no way to find out where you will end up. If you decline the location, your offer gets cancelled.I would love San Diego as well!Exam: 12/10 (for West Coast)Reapplied: 7/11 (for SWB)TSL: 10/28/11 (SWB)PFT1: 12/2/11 (passed)Medical: 12/2/11 (passed)VBT & S.I.: 1/10/12 (passed)B.I.: 3/19/12 met with BI (in security office)Qualifications: 3/22/12 (cleared)Drug Test: 5/17/2012 (cleared)PFT2: ?CommentPostCancelcfalcoForum MemberJoin Date: Nov 2011Posts: 22ShareTweet#2783012-13-2011, 05:40 PMOriginally posted by DSgirlCA View PostI asked the same question.

Your failed Poly is considered part of your background investigation, you will make it through the process until they reach your background investigation and then you will likely be taken out of the process as they investigate your background and find that you previously failed a poly with CBP.Keep going with the process, you never know, but I've seen this happen before unfortunately.What is your current GEO?Last edited by 180Degrees; 12-14-2011, 12:06 AM.CommentPostCancelPrevious 1 856 1356 1756 1806 1846 1847 1848 1849 1850 1851 1852 1853 1854 1855 1856 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 1866 1906 1956 2356 2856 4037 template NextMR300x250 TabletCollapseWhat's Going OnCollapseThere are currently 6020 users online. 346 members and 5674 guests.Most users ever online was 158,966 at 05:57 AM on 01-16-2021.Tag CloudCollapseacademy advice background investigation california corrections employment florida hiring hiring process holster interview lapd law enforcement new york nypd police sheriff texas training trooperWelcome AdCollapseCool Blue- Cool BlueDefault vB5 StyleEnglish (US)Deutsch (Du)English (US)FrenchSpanishHelpContact UsFire House ForumsSecurity Info Watch ForumsGo to topCopyright 1996-2017, Officer.com, Southcomm Business Media - Public Safety InteractivePowered by vBulletin® Version 5.6.4Copyright © 2021 vBulletin Solutions, Inc.
