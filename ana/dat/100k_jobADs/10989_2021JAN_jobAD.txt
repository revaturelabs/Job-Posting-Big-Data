The intelligence community was very clear. They forecasted the rise of a group – you and I know it as ISIS – and we should have taken their advice on board.\"Mattis' comments come a day after President Trump pulled out of peace talks with Afghanistan and the Taliban.\"Can they be trusted?\" Mattis asked, supporting the peace talks with the Taliban because \"all wars eventually come to an end, and I salute efforts to try to end that war, no doubt.\" \"You remember when we reduced nuclear weapons with Russia, we talked about 'trust, but verify.'\"In this case with this group, I think you want to verify then trust. We have asked them –demanded – that they break with al-Qaida since the Bush administration. They have refused to do so. They murdered 3,000 innocent people, citizens of 91 countries on 9/11. We should never forget that. The Taliban hid those people among them, refused to break with them, and have refused to this day to break.\"Related Stories:Julián Castro: Trump 'Elevating' Enemies, TerroristsPompeo on Terror Vacuum?
