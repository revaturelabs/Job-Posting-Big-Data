"Baili And I...: What I Learnt From My SECOND JOB!Baili And I...Your Brain Is Your Adorable Puppy! DON\"T Let It Turn Into a Wild Monster Who Can Drag You Whereever He WantsThursday, November 8, 2018What I Learnt From My SECOND JOB!It was 1997 or 1998 probably . My eldest son was 4 or 5 years old .When my younger sister left for U.S.A with her (first) husband for the honeymoon which turned into a long stay (almost six years) there in Arlington Virginia.My parents were living alone in the newly built house in capital city Islamabad almost one hour drive from our native village.My father like as usual was not always with my mom as he had weird habit to suddenly leave few times in a year for his native city Kashmir or other provinces and cities of our country .Meanwhile mother was alone and this was the reason that with the advise of my younger sister and permission of my husband i moved to stay with my mother in Islamabad.There was also another reason hidden in my heart that may be by this way i will be able to participate in making our son's future better as big cities have environment little easier for females to do jobs as there are far more opportunities to obtain career .Anyway after moving with my mom my first priority was to look after her in all possible ways and then looking for job.First of all i put my son in school which was quite expensive but had good teaching standards so i was satisfied as it was only a 15 minutes walk away from home and before leaving for job i could easily drop my son to school everyday.I have mentioned about my first job in matrimonial office in my an old post may be month back. I left that job because the owners were revealed as fraud and were faking people for money and not taking any interest in their duties of match making .After leaving this job i was anxious as i was only ten grade passed that time and there was less chance for another decent job soon.One night while talking on phone my younger sister embarrassed me that with such small degree i will be able to do nothing and no one will pay me as i don't know even how to operate a computer blah blah blah...She was same in degree but she was (is) far smarter ,confident ,beautiful and active than me . Her communication skills were amazing.I was agreed with her about my all the lesser skills but i was stronger in my faith so i replied her calmly that\" i know that may be no one will give me job but i believe my God will\"Her laughter still echo in my head!Next morning with little sad heart when i went to drop my eldest son in his school, inevitably i entered the school building and asked spot lady to that \"can i meet the principal ?S.L.S school was something far modern and disciplined and i was not sure that my request will be processed as when she asked me to tell the reason i said it is personal!After half hour wait when earlier guest left i was called to meet principal , i was nervous inside but there was only one thing very clear in my mind that i was not doing anything wrong so why hesitate ?Principal was a middle aged fashionable lady with smile less face and sharp curious eyes.I simply told her that i am only tenth grade passed and want a job just to support my son 's education.She asked if i was single mother ? I told her that i have husband who sent us money every month which is enough for our expenses still i want to work for the sake of my own desire of being self dependent to some extent.This time the flatness of her face loosened and slight friendly smile appeared which was encouraging and needed !She said she really appreciate women who have no strong need though , yet they come out of their comfort zone just for the betterment of their children .She admired my wish and effort that i want to raise my son in better environment and for this i am ready to sacrifice rest and peace of my life which is more easy to have in house as house wife.I told her i can be helper in small office jobs or i can do cleaning and keep check on student's discipline .She said it will not be fair to do such odd jobs where your own son is studying., but i will try to get you appoint somewhere else...To be continued.......Posted by baili at 10:20 PMReactions:Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest29 comments:Ola November 9, 2018 at 3:12 AMInteresting to read how your open words opened the doors...ReplyDeleteRepliesbaili November 9, 2018 at 9:08 PMthank you dear Ola!Faith is key to open all the doors ,that is what i learnt from my 48 years lifeDeleteRepliesReplyReplyLeigh November 9, 2018 at 3:20 AMWhat a place to stop! lolReplyDeleteRepliesbaili November 9, 2018 at 9:07 PMDear Leigh!i had not planned to divide this post into 2 parts i had to leave it as i got guestsDeleteRepliesReplyReplyBrian Joseph November 9, 2018 at 3:38 AMWhat an interesting history that you have.
