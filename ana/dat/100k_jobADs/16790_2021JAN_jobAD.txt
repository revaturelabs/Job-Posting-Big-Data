Picture: Dimpho Maja/African News Agency (ANA)of the available spaces which are more affordable and allow for developmentDe Wetshof still mainly consists of freeholds, but the prospects of booming sectional title estates and the apartment market look good as the many and large, open green spaces in the neighbourhood are amenable to development.This would make housing more affordable to more younger people. Presently, the majority of residents are mature folk aged between 50 and 64, the kind who can afford the prices of a little less than R2million in an area with average monthly household salaries of between R65000 to R80000, says Lynn McKay of O-Yes Properties.“There are enough open spaces for developments of sectional titles which could assist the younger generation to purchase and be closer to the city, universities, highways and work destinations, thereby encouraging cheaper multiple dwellings,” says McKay, who notes high purchase prices have prevented youth from properly tapping into this market.Due to the locality of De Wetshof and its small size, it is quite an over-looked suburb and yet it has so much to offer regarding the properties there. – Lynn McKay, estate agent, O-Yes Properties Picture: Supplied“The high-end property market is about R1.95m. Land can be acquired between R650000 and R900000. House values have not really dropped in the past two years,” says McKay, arguing that in a better economic climate prices can possibly go up to R3m because of the huge stand sizes and properties.“The properties in Dewetshof are fairly large and most situated on 1000m². The quality of the houses is solid. Home interiors generally range from well-looked-after to continued improvement and renovations.”“It’s an established, well-maintained older suburb with lovely homes and streets, centrally located to all amenities.”She says the majority of mature owners has lived in De Wetshof for a long time, and middle-aged buyers have also purchased here as the size of the properties are good for families, and there’s centrality to schools.“However a small percentage of youth is purchasing in De Wetshof,” say McKay.For those who cannot afford the prices but would like to purchase a home in this lovely area, McKay recommends share-buying or rent-to-buy.“Due to the locality of De Wetshof and its small size, it is quite an over-looked suburb and yet has so much to offer regarding the properties,” she says.Relative to its size and the state of the current economy, the four homes sold in the neighbourhood so far this year could be considered to be in keeping with the current purchasing property trends. In 2017 11 sales were registered and in 2018, eight were sold.“Another of the early settlers on the Witwatersrand, the Bezuidenhouts, built their farmhouse in 1863 on the farm Doornfontein, which was one of 20 farms which made up the future City of Johannesburg,” says McKay, adding that the 130-year-old house still stands in the local Bezuidenhout/Homestead Park.She cites large green spaces to walk dogs and the hill location for the wonderful views among the many attractions.De Wetshof prices compare very well with those for Cyrildene.Kathy Munro’s favourite places and things to doDe Wetshof is a small, centrally located suburb, now about 50 to 60 years old.
