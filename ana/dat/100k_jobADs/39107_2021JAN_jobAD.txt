The National Association of Realtors yesterday said existing home sales rose 4.3 per cent month-on-month in October to their fastest seasonally adjusted annual rate since November 2005, thanks in part to the Federal Reserve's move to slash its borrowing rate to zero as the pandemic arrived.The Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported more manufacturing firms seeing their activity increase than decrease this month, but its regional index for the sector declined by six points as new orders and shipments decreased.“The absence of federal benefit subsidies and (small and medium enterprise) support threatens a resumed collapse in demand and a spiralling economic retreat in the months ahead,” investment banker Dan Alpert said on Twitter.“Protecting the economy is critical but so, too, is offering humanity to households entering this holiday season in despair.”Now you can read the Jamaica Observer ePaper anytime, anywhere.
