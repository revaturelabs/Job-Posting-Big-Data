Utilizing state-of-the-art proprietary technologies, including modular grow zones, customized LED lighting, precisely tuned climate controls and an artificial intelligence powered growing system, the company is able to offer customers flavorful, and nutritious locally grown fruits and vegetables at affordable prices.Company Website: https://www.eafarms.com/Project Summary:Type of Project: ExpansionNumber of Jobs:Jobs committed: 125Jobs retained: 29Types of jobs: The company will add to its executive team and hire additional operations and support staffCapital Investment: $26,975,000Company Need:80 Acres Farms is an expanding producer of year-round, hydroponically grown fruits and vegetables. 80 Acres sought to establish a permanent North American headquarters, as well as a pilot farm and large ‘grow zone’ farming operation. The pilot farm in particular will serve as a reference design for other operations as they are established.This facility represents a long-term investment for the company with the potential for further growth in the future.Why Ohio?Ohio is a predominant state for food and agribusiness, consisting of an end-to-end food value chain and a multifaceted infrastructure for quick and affordable access to consumers and suppliers.In fact, market access and customer relationships were integral in the company’s decision to establish a permanent headquarters in Hamilton, Ohio. The new growth will result in 125 jobs and draw more than $26 million in capital investment. The company will build a pilot farm that will serve as a reference design for other indoor growing operations, including its first grow zone at the location, housing its controlled environment farming. 80 Acres will be doing this as Infinite Acres, a recently announced joint venture with UK-based online grocery retailer Ocado (which recently partnered with Kroger) and Netherlands-based Priva Holding BV.As consumer preferences and other factors affect the industry, companies can use Ohio’s resources to turn challenge into opportunity. The state’s southwest region is the second largest hub for food flavoring in the U.S. and home to leading grocer and innovator Kroger.The 80 Acres headquarters in Hamilton reflects the company’s continued growth, including its expansion into new markets.Testimonial:“Hamilton is a rising community looking for diversified growth and is strategically located near multiple large population centers. Sustainability continues to be an essential part of our business, and Hamilton’s commitment to emissions-free, renewable energy through hydropower was also an important component in our decision to become an even bigger part of the Hamilton community.” – Mike Zelkind, co-founder and CEO, 80 Acres FarmsCollaborators:The city of Hamilton, Ohio Development Services Agency, REDI Cincinnati, JobsOhioBack to NewsNextAMG Vanadium Constructing a Second Ohio Plant, Investing More Than $200 MillionJuly 29, 2019PreviousTotal Quality Logistics Pledges Nearly 600 New Jobs and $20 Million Investment in OhioJuly 29, 2019Contact Us261Client ReviewsGreat things are happening in Ohio.Connect with us to learn more about how you can be a part of it.Contact JobsOhio: 1.614.224.6446Toll Free: 1.855.874.2530Email: contact@jobsohio.comAddress: 41 S High St #1500, Columbus, OH 43215About JobsOhioAbout UsJobsOhio ResultsCorporate GovernanceFinancial Statements & IRS FilingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy PolicyJobsOhio CareersBoard of DirectorsJobsOhio NetworkState Agencies of OhioContact UsSign Up for EmailCopyright 2021 JobsOhio.
