The site is like having a coordinator with a nearly inexhaustible rolodex. John Hansen AMS PicturesStaff Me Up has been more effective at getting me work than any other industry/job related site. I'm able to get notification of where the production is in the hiring process. It's gotten me several jobs and a production even found ME and invited me to apply. That's nice. David White Camera OperatorI've been hired through Staff Me Up at least 5 times over the past year. 50%+ of my freelance work from one site! I hadn't found any opportunities for 6 months searching elsewhere. Thanks to Staff Me Up, I've been able to build my resume and, most importantly, I can keep connected to those I've worked with on past shows. Love the site!
