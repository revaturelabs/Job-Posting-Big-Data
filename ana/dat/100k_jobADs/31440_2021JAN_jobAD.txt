It has become an issue of concern within the sector. The forestry sector provides 740 badly needed jobs in Tipperary. The sector also contributes some €2.3bn to the economy annually and plays a major role in combating climate change,” he said.Last week, it was reported that a staggering 4,600 forestry licence applications are backlogged in the Forestry Service; this was despite the fact that DAFM has consistently stated that circa 2,000 forestry licences were backlogged.Sen Ahearn asked the Minister to elaborate on the correct backlog of numbers and to also specify a timeline as to when the backlog will be cleared.Minister McConalogue stated “My immediate priority is to resolve the issues which have led to this backlog and issue licences in the volume needed for this important sector to continue to contribute to our rural economy. There is no instantaneous solution, but we are making significant progress. My Department is working with a great degree of urgency to accelerate the pace at which licences are issued, and to ensure that the system in place stands the test of time and meets all the legal requirements”.If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on 028 7129 6600 for Derry City stories Or 028 7774 3970 for County Derry stories.
