I edited the crontab, placed the job there and after exiting my editor a messaged popped-up saying \"crontab: installing new crontab\". I waited for the changes my php script should have done to my database buy unfortunately it didn't even change a thing. I also checked for the status of crond service and it says it's already running. My cron job looks like this: * 8,20 * * * /usr/local/bin/php71 my/php/script an_argument. Can someone tell me where did go wrong with my cron?cron cronjob crond crontabasked 22 Mar '18, 06:29atomlab11●2accept rate: 0%One Answer:active answersoldest answersnewest answerspopular answers0You should try to redirect any output to a file.
