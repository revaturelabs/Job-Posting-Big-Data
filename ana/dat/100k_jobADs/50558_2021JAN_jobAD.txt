Critical to this objective is understanding immune-microbiota dialogue in the establishment and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.ï‚· Our immediate objective is to define the molecular basis through which gut microbes coordinate immune tolerance, and the nature of their interactions with the intestinal immune system.ï‚· This will be addressed by leveraging cutting-edge microbiological and immunological techniques allied to metagenomics in gnotobiotic mouse models of IBD and allergy, to provide insights into the specific bacterial genes and pathways that drive the development of anti-inflammatory immune responses in the intestine.ï‚· The ideal candidate will be a self-motivated individual who wants to drive their own research project while working in a collaborative environment.ï‚· The candidate will have completed, or be close to completing, a Ph.D. degree (or M.D. with at least 3 years research experience), and be interested in microbiota research, specifically in working at the interface of microbiology and immunology.ï‚· Experience in cellular or molecular immunology, and animal models of inflammatory disease is required.
