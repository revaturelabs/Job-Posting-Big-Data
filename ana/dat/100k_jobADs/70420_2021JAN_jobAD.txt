Actions:Recruiter Actions:96Clinton Health Access Initiative - Manager - Essential Medicines (7-10 yrs)MP/Bhopal Job Code: 846725#Program Management#NGO#Project Management#Strategy Consulting#Consulting - HealthcareThe Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit https://www.clintonhealthaccess.orgCHAI, in partnership with its India affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF), works in close partnership with and under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer, sexual and reproductive health and immunisation. Additionally, CHAI is supporting the government of Madhya Pradesh (MP) on large-scale programs to arrest childhood and maternal mortality due pneumonia, malnutrition, anaemia, and diarrhoea.Background:Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) had launched an effort to scale-up access to treatment for Pneumonia & Diarrhea, which combined, kills over 1.5 million children every year. Working with the governments of five-high-burden countries (India, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and Nigeria) and leading global institutions, CHAI is supporting intensified efforts at both global and country levels to plan, resource, and implement effective interventions for scaling-up access to treatment for these conditions. This is achieved by supporting Governments effort in improving access to oxygen and anti-biotics for pneumonia, and, zinc and ORS for diarrhoea.CHAI, in partnership with its India affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF) has implemented efforts to increase the percent of children with Diarrhoea receiving the correct treatment of zinc/ORS in three focus states (Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh), since 2012. In the current phase of this program, CHAIs efforts will focus on under five Pneumonia management, particularly ensuring timely diagnosis & treatment for children with Pneumonia & severe Pneumonia and availability of oxygen at all public health facilities. CHAI, in partnership with its affiliate William J Clinton Foundation, is building on its work on supporting efforts to reduce mortality among children below 5 years of age in Madhya Pradesh (MP), which accounts for approximately one eighth of total pneumonia mortality in the country.[1] Appropriate pneumonia treatment and care is constrained by primary dependence in rural areas on informal providers, who lack appropriate training and knowledge as also supply chain inefficiencies that hamper availability of essential medicines and commodities. Further, knowledge and skills gaps at mid-tier public health facilities lead to inconsistent and inaccurate pneumonia classification and higher burden on higher level healthcare facilities.To overcome these challenges, CHAI/WJCF has been working with government to draft a comprehensive strategy to significantly improve treatment and care and, therefore, outcomes for children suffering from pneumonia. To that end, the program imparts skill-based training for providers at public health facilities, supports measures to improve quantification, procurement and distribution of essential medicines, helps mentor staff at various aspects of oxygen administration and supports improvements in availability of pulse-oximeters for increased hypoxemia screening. At the national level, the program has supported efforts in launching the revised Pneumonia Operational Guidelines and has supported the Social Awareness and Action plan to Neutralise Pneumonia from Society (SAANS) campaign to intensify action for reducing mortality due to childhood pneumonia.CHAI/WJCF is seeking a highly motivated individual with outstanding credentials in program management, operations, analytical ability, and communication skills to support the EM program in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The candidate will work closely with a multitude of internal and external stakeholders on improving program outcomes and ensuring program sustainability. The candidate must be able to function independently and have a strong commitment to excellence. CHAI places great value on relevant personal qualities: resourcefulness, responsibility, tenacity, independence, energy, and work ethic.[1] National, regional, and state-level all-cause and cause-specific under-5 mortality in India in 200015: a systematic analysis with implications for the Sustainable Development Goals, Lancet Vol 7, June 2019Responsibilities1) Support program leadership in overall project management oversight to operationalize and effectively implement the pneumonia & oxygen scale up program strategy in Madhya Pradesh2) Support Ministry of Health in Madhya Pradesh to identify and accelerate implementation of highest-impact interventions to reduce pneumonia and diarrhea morbidity/mortality amongst children3) Work closely with the Government of MP to identify and bridge gaps in supply chain, capacity building, monitoring and evaluation to ensure sustainability4) Engage with stakeholders at various levels (national, state, cities), including both Government and Non-Government organizations, and coordinate with them for improved program performance and delivery5) Ensure compliance with all administrative, financial, and contractual aspects of program6) Support program leadership in building and managing a high-performing team7) Design and implement processes, systems for collection, collation, and synthesis of program data to inform program strategy, operations, and reviews8) Prepare and present high-quality up-to-date documents of program activities and achievements including progress reports, and process documentation9) Work in a collaborative environment with EM and other teams10) Travel as required to provide on-ground assistance to team(s), partners, and counterparts11) Works closely with and draw on CHAIs global and country expertise in demand generation and supply-side engagements for improvement of program design12) Should be willing to travel on short notice within state and India with 50-70% travelQualifications1) Bachelors degree in Economics, Business, Technology, or other quantitative subjects; MBA or a Masters Degree in other quantitative disciplines with 7-10 years experience in program management and leading operations in public health at the National and State level2) Dynamic, entrepreneurial individual with outstanding managerial, strategic, and communication skills3) Work experience in consulting or a fast-paced result-oriented organization is essential4) Ability to think strategically, handle ambiguity, and solve problems in a fast-paced environment5) Ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, set priorities, and work independently6) Ability to absorb and concisely synthesize a broad range of information, including clinical and scientific / technical information7) Demonstrated success in coordinating various stakeholders and interests groups (public sector engagement would be highly desirable) and developing strong relationships to successfully drive programs8) Government stakeholder management experience would be a strong positiveThis job opening was posted long time back.
