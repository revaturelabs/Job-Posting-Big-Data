Stay Jolly This Holiday Season at Your Healthcare Job. Here’s How!Posted on 12/2 by Annmary Durkin	November and December are stressful months especially if you’re working in a healthcare setting. However, with the right approach, you can keep your spirits bright. Here’s how to stay jolly this holiday season at your healthcare job.Tips to Stay Jolly This Holiday Season at Your Healthcare JobBe RealisticYou know it’s supposed to be “the most wonderful time of the year,” but healthcare jobs don’t include holiday downtime. In fact, you’ll probably end up logging more hours during November and December. Plus, you’ll need to work harder to cheer up your patients. After all, who wants to be sick during the holidays? As a result, your role may be more draining than usual. So, cut yourself some slack if you’re not immersed in holiday joy. You’re doing the best you can.Make Self-Care a PriorityTaking care of yourself isn’t selfish, it’s essential. Because if you’re aren’t feeling your best, you can’t provide quality care to your patients. Therefore, set aside non-negotiable time for yourself. For example, commit to exercising for twenty minutes every morning no matter what and/or stick to a strict bedtime routine. For more ideas on maintaining your own health and wellbeing, check out the post, 10 Ways to Start a Self-Care Routine.Budget Your TimeThe holiday season is busy. You’re happy to host a party, attend an event, and work an extra shift… until you find yourself overextended and exhausted. Again, remember, while many people have more free time during the holidays, healthcare workers usually have less. Thus, be careful not to tackle more than you can handle. A calendar may come in handy. Start at the beginning of the season by filling in your top priorities. Then, before you agree to anything else, check your schedule first.Appreciate the Small ThingsYou most likely can’t take a week off during the holidays. You may not be able to go on vacation. And you could have to work Thanksgiving, Christmas AND New Year’s Day. But this doesn’t mean you won’t enjoy the season. Instead of focusing on the big losses, search for the small wins. Admire the Christmas lights in your town. Savor a cup of hot chocolate with a peppermint stick. Or cherish the look on a patient’s face when you give them a little gift. Treasuring those small moments will remind you what the holidays are truly about.Spread Some Holiday CheerAlthough it seems counter-intuitive, doing something nice for others benefits YOU. So, if you’re feeling a little bit down in the holiday dumps, spread some cheer. Put up decorations for your patients. Plan a fun holiday-themed activity. Or bring in a seasonal treat for your coworkers. In the end, even a small gesture can boost everyone’s spirits.Are You Looking for a Healthcare Job That Makes You Feel Jolly This Holiday Season?Anodyne is urgently hiring caregivers, home health aides, and CNAs.
