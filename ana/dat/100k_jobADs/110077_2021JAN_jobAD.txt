"Pizza Hut says driverless delivery could create more jobs than it destroys – Impact LabSkip to contentA Laboratory of the Future Human ExperienceHomeAboutFuturist SpeakerBook Thomas FreyDaVinci InstitutePizza Hut says driverless delivery could create more jobs than it destroysAI, Automation, Business, Driverless vehicles, Employment	Pizza Hut and Toyota are partnering on an autonomous delivery vehicle called e-Palette that could make the delivery process driverless.Despite the implications for current drivers, Pizza Hut said driverless delivery could create more jobs than it displaces.The robots are coming…and they’re bringing pizza? At CES 2018 in Las Vegas, Pizza Hut and Toyota unveiled their plans for a fully-autonomous delivery vehicles that could bring pizza to your door without a human driver.The concept, called e-Palette, was further detailed in a press release as well. Pizza Hut has already begun developing algorithms to improve the reliability of deliveries, and driverless delivery is part of its initiative to “provide the best delivery experience,” the release said.The obvious implications for current drivers are pretty clear—they’ll be out of a job if this thing makes it to market. However, in a Twitter discussion about the e-Palette’s impact on jobs, Pizza Hut said that it could actually create more jobs than it destroys.After announcing the concept on Twitter, a user named Jennifer Ryan asked Pizza Hut how it would move delivery drivers into other positions and avoid putting “several hundreds of thousands of people out of jobs?” While the official Pizza Hut Twitter account didn’t directly answer Ryan’s question, it did posit that more jobs would be created as a result of e-Palette.“It actually could create more jobs by opening the pool of “drivers” to those who do not own vehicles. They might act more as servers, focusing on hospitality,” Pizza Hut said on Twitter.Pizza Hut’s argument is one that has been posed by the tech industry since AI came back into fashion a few years ago. The idea is that AI and automation will free up workers to focus on higher-level tasks.In addition to working as a delivery vehicle, e-Palette could also be used as a sort of mobile kitchen in certain markets as well, the release said, which could create other jobs as well. However, it’s still likely a long ways off.Until the e-Pallette comes to fruition, Pizza Hut will be working with Toyota to improve its existing driver and delivery ecosystem. The pair will be testing communication technology as a way to “capture data on driver patterns and behaviors,” which will improve performance and safety, the release said.Still, the full impact of AI on the workforce remains to be seen. Many have argued along Pizza Hut’s lines that AI will create more jobs than it displaces, but the opposite has been argued by experts in the field as well. Now, it’s time to play the waiting game.Via TechrepublicTag: E-Pallett, Pizza Hut, toyota	Post navigationPrevious postUrban farming will..Next postGM is dropping..Search for:CategoriesCategories Select Category 2019 CES 2019 Predictions 2020 Predictions 2021 Predictions 3D Printer Advertising Agriculture AI Airbnb Airbus Alternative Transportation Alzheimer’s Disease Amazon.com Analysis Animals App Apple Architecture Art Artificial Intelligence Augmented Reality Automation Automobiles Aviation Award Winner Baby Gadgets Banking Batteries Battery Beauty Beer bicycle Big Data Big Problems Bill Gates Biotech Birth Bitcoin Blockchain bluetooth body antenna Boeing Botnet Brain brain hacking brain malware brain-computer interfaces brains Breakthrough Thinking Business Camping Cancer CES 2018 CES 2020 Children China CIA Cinema Citibank City Planning Climate Change Clothing Co Working Coding Coding Schools communication Computer Security Cooking Coronavirus Corporate Manipulation Coworking Crazy Photos Crazy Stuff Credit Crime Crime Prevention Crypto-Technology Culture Current Events cutting edge DARPA Dating DaVinci Coders DaVinci Institute DaVinci Inventor Showcase DDoS DIY DNA Driverless cars Driverless vehicles Drone drones Ecological Products Economy Education Electric Automobile Electric Vehicles Elon Musk Employment Energy Engineering Entertainment Environment facebook Famous Inventor Farming Farms Fashion Film Films Finance Food Ford Motor Company Future Futurist Game Development Games Genes Genetics Ghost Children Global Warming Globalism Google government Great New Product Great Videos Green Friendly Hackers Hacking Health Health & Fitness Healthcare Higher Education Historical Perspectives Home Technology Hot Issues Housing Human Behavior Humor Hyperloop IBM IBM Watson Ideas Insects Insurance Intellectual Property Intelligence Internet Internet of Things Inventions Latest News Latest Trend Law Enforcement LED Legal Issues Legalized marijuana Life Skills Lifestyle Machine Learning Marketing Mass Transit Medical Breakthrough Medicine Memory Microsoft Military military drones mobile apps mobile technology Money Talk Movies Music Nanotechnology NASA Netflix New Discoveries New Inventions new technology New Viewpoints Parenting Patents People Making a Difference Photo Perspectives Plant Life privacy Programming quantum computing Racing Record Breaker Recycling Report Robotics Robots Science & Technology News Science Fiction Sealife security Self-driving Cars Shopping Social Media Software Development Solar Energy Solar Power Space Space Flight SpaceX Spirituality sports Star Trek Star Wars Startup Stem cells subliminal messages Technological Unemployment Terrorism Tesla Textiles Tiny House Tom Frey top 10 Top 25 Inventions of 2017 Tourism Transportation Travel Travel Trending Twitter Uber Uncategorized United Parcel Service Upcoming Events UPS Venture Capital Video Video Games Virtual Reality Volvo VR Weapons Wearables Weather Wi-Fi Wind Power women YouTubeRecent PostsNew Research Could Enable Direct Data Transfer From Computers to Living CellsSamsung is making a robot that can pour wine and bring you a drinkPollen Robotics’ humanoid robot can be controlled remotely with VRUber and Lyft increase average vehicle ownership in urban areasThis Flying Car Costs $599K—and It’s Now Street Legal in HollandResearchers Develop World’s Most Powerful Neuromorphic Processor for AITesla’s $25,000 electric car could be coming sooner than we thoughThese Futuristic Flying Ambulances May Soon Be Zooming Around New YorkSCIENTISTS WANT TO SEND A ROBOT MADE OF ICE TO ANOTHER PLANET‘Virtual biopsies’ could replace tissue biopsies in future thanks to technique developed by Cambridge scientistsTesla’s Autopilot Full Self-Driving Completes Round Trip From San Francisco to Los Angeles PRACTICALLY WITHOUT ANY HUMAN INTERVENTION.Study Finds More Than $100 Billion Spent on App Stores in 2020Japanese researchers are developing satellites made of woodCurrent spacesuits won’t cut it on the moon.
