We are looking for specialists in a variety of fields connected to futures thinking, foresight, organisational change, radical innovation, emerging tech, and technology assessment.The anticipatory innovation governance team works with governments on understanding transformative change to shape the future in the present. Anticipation is the act of creating knowledge about plausible futures, but innovation is needed to take action based on that information and start actively shaping the future today (read our recent policy note here). Our mission is to help governments be more proactive, rather than reactive and we work with leading governments around the world to help them build up their institutions that would allow them to do that. We are currently working with Finland, Sweden, Slovenia, Ireland, Latvia and many others.The team uses a mixture of approaches and methodologies based in innovation theory, futures thinking, foresight, technology assessment, systems thinking, designing thinking, and action research. We use both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods. We care about implementation, not just ideas. We value rigor, creativity, diversity, new perspectives, experimentation and collaboration, but first and foremost a supportive team environment that encourages curiosity and ambition around our mission.If this speaks to you and you would like to help us push governments to dare a bit more, consider joining us. In addition to general requirements and core competencies for OECD policy analysts, our team is specifically interested in:Experience in fields related to futures thinking, foresight, organisational change, innovation, emerging tech, and technology assessmentAn advanced academic degree in related field would be a plus, but is not a requirementAbility to look at problems in a new perspective and an experimental mind-setExperience working in government on the related fields would be highly appreciated, but not a mustProven track record in drafting analyses, information visualisation, presenting findings, and communicating to different audiencesProcess design and facilitation experience would be an assetOur project portfolio is broad and there is ample opportunity to propose new ideas and areas of research. Tasks will vary depending on the projects at hand, but involve research design, action research, data analysis, sense-making, proposing and creating new frameworks, setting up experiments, liaising with governments, building networks of experts and public officials, and leading workshops and seminars.This position is based in Paris, France and is on a one-year fixed-term contract with option to renew. OECD is also open to teleworking arrangements. The starting monthly salary could start at 6130 EUR, plus allowances based on eligibility, exempt of French income tax. While either English or French fluency is required by the OECD, the anticipatory innovation governance team’s current daily working language is English. While we will make our decisions as quickly as possible, the full OECD recruitment process could take several months.How to apply:Submit your application to the OECD centralised application by 16 December (23:59 pm CET) under the call for Policy Analysts at the Public Governance Directorate (Job Number: 13980)If you have any questions, please e-mail us at opsi@oecd.orgsource:Anticipatory innovation governance team is recruiting (due date 16 December)  | LinkedInLeave a Reply Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment.Post navigation← Job advert – Programme Manager for Map the System | Saïd Business School, University of OxfordSelf-organisation and political systems | by Aidan Ward | GentlySerious | Nov, 2020 | Medium →This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.SearchSearchFollow Systems Community of Inquiry on WordPress.comFollow via EmailEnter your email address to follow stream.syscoi.com and receive notifications of new posts by email.Join 516 other followers	Email Address:	FollowArchivesArchives Select Month January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017Tags375 anthropology apithology architecture awomansplace behavioral science complexity complex systems connectivity cybernetics dark age ahead death definition Detectorism diaspora ecological economics ecology economics equilibrium facebook federated fourth turning generational theory google plus governance health innovation inquiry james grier miller jane jacobs kenneth boulding living systems management mastodon meme MeToo mooc multi-disciplinary nature of economies negotiated order Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen onethingseries online communities open systems thinking open university organisation pathology pattern language practice public regeneration restorative science and technology studies sensemaking SH302 shutdown social enterprise social network sustainability systemchange systemic systemleadership systems systems approach systemschange systems engineering systemsleadership systems of survival systems research systems sciences systems thinking systemsthinking west churchman what is wicked problemsBlogrollASCCoevolving InnovationsIFSRISSSmodel.report ArchiveSCiOUKSSTwitterMy TweetsRSS - PostsRSS - CommentsCreate a website or blog at WordPress.comssearchccompose new postrreplyeedittgo to topjgo to the next post or commentkgo to the previous post or commentotoggle comment visibilityesccancel edit post or comment{{{ data.appControls.join( ' | ' ) }}} <# } else { #> <# if ( data.showTitle && data.pageTitle != '' ) { #>{{{ data.pageTitle }}}<# } #> <# } #><# if ( data.showNavigation ) { #><# if ( data.hasPrevPost ) { #>← {{{ data.prevPostTitle }}}<# } #> <# if ( data.hasNextPost ) { #>{{{ data.nextPostTitle }}} →<# } #><# } #><# } #> <# if ( ! data.isPage ) { #> {{ data.author.displayName }} <# } #> <# if ( ! data.isSaving ) { #> {{{ data.postActions }}} <# } #> {{{ data.entryHeaderMeta }}}<# if ( data.showTitle && ! data.titleWasGeneratedFromContent ) { #><# if ( data.linkTitle ) { #> {{{ data.titleFiltered }}} <# } else { #> {{{ data.titleFiltered }}} <# } #><# } #>{{{ data.contentFiltered }}} {{{ data.linkPages }}}{{{ data.footerEntryMeta }}} <# if ( data.postID ) { #>{{ data.strings.showComments }}<# } else { #><# } #><# } #> <# if ( ! data.isPage ) { #> {{ data.author.displayName }} <# } #> {{{ data.postActions }}} {{{ data.entryHeaderMeta }}}<# if ( !! window.o2Config.gutenberg ) { #><# } else { #>{{ data.contentRaw }}{{ data.strings.edit }}{{ data.strings.preview }}{{ data.strings.save }} {{ data.strings.cancel }}<# } #>{{{ data.footerEntryMeta }}}{{ data.strings.edit }}{{ data.strings.preview }}{{ data.strings.post }}{{{ data.postFormExtras }}}<# if ( o2.options.useBlockEditor ) { #> Add New Post <# } #><# } else { #> {{ data.author.displayName }} <# } #> <# if ( o2.options.showParentCommentLink && ! _.isEmpty( data.parentCommentAuthor ) ) { #> {{ data.strings.commentReplyTo }} {{ data.parentCommentAuthor.displayName }} ⋅ <# } #> <# if ( !
