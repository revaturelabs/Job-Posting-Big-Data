"2021 Recreation Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CA | WayUpCandidatesEmployersLoginSign UpExplore OpportunitiesEntry-level JobsLocationIrvine, CA2021 Recreation Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAHaving a job that revolves largely around fun and games might seem to be too good to be true, but it’s more than possible if you choose entry-level jobs in recreation. Maybe, for example, you’d like to join the 19,180 recreational therapists currently working in the United States. People with this job in recreation work to develop, plan, and/or oversee fun but also constructive activities for those in nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, specialty summer camps, and more. Instead of working with large groups, some recreational therapists work one-on-one with specific clients or patients to help them accomplish certain goals in a fun way. No matter where they work, however, modern recreational therapists enjoy an average salary of around $44,280 per year. There are other recreation entry-level jobs available too. If you want to plan fun activities without worrying about the “therapeutic” part, you could become a recreation worker for a summer camp, a school, a daycare facility, or for a wide variety of other private and public organizations. 309,370 people are lucky enough to have these fun recreation jobs and to earn around $25,430 per year doing them. The vast majority of recreational workers are employed by government organizations, though you’ll also find large numbers working in nursing homes, civic organizations, in individual and/or family service organizations, and in various amusement industries. Speaking of amusement, you could land a fun job at a local theme park! If you enjoy being outdoors, assisting others, and working to ensure that everyone has a safe and fun day at the park, you could become a recreation attendant and earn around $20,020 per year for your time. Many people take on these seasonal roles just as a nice change of pace. Of course, a change of pace isn’t really necessary for most workers in this industry, since jobs in the recreation field always prove interesting and exciting.External JobKKathy ChriquiMultiple LocationsReceptionistApplyExternal JobHHB StaffingSanta Ana, CAReceptionist Office AssistantApplyExternal JobWWhitehead Employment LawIrvine, CAReceptionist/Admin AssistantApplyExternal JobJJobTracks, Inc.Multiple LocationsReceptionistApplyExternal JobFFuscoe EngineringIrvine, CAReceptionistApplyExternal JobPPremier HRBuena Park, CAReceptionistApplyExternal JobTTransHope MedicalMultiple LocationsMedical Office Reception assistant / TMS operatorApplyExternal JobTTim Greenleaf EngineeringHuntington Beach, CAFront Office ReceptionistApplyExternal JobAAppleOneSanta Ana, CAFront Office Receptionist - $16ApplyExternal JobWWellspring LifeCareMultiple LocationsMandarin speaking medical receptionistApplyExternal JobAAlex Roldan at The LondonMultiple LocationsSales AssociateApplyExternal JobWWestminster Veterinary GroupWestminster, CACustomer Service RepresentativeApplyExternal JobWWSH ManagementIrvine, CAAdministrative Assistant - Property Management - IrvineApplyExternal JobMMELA GroupWestminster, CACustomer Support Representative / Customer Solutions ProviderApplyExternal JobSScheduling ExpertsMultiple LocationsCustomer Service RepresentativeApplyExternal JobTTRI Pointe Group, Inc.Irvine, CASanitation TechnicianApplyExternal JobMMantek Solutions IncCosta Mesa, CAProject Management AnalystApplyExplore 2021 Recreation Entry-level JobsRemote Recreation Entry-level JobsColleges and Universities in Irvine, CAUniversity of California-IrvineFIDM/Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising-Orange CountyMore Related 2021 Entry-level JobsRecreation Entry-level JobsIrvine, CA Entry-level JobsMore 2021 Recreation Entry-level Jobs in Nearby CitiesRecreation Entry-level Jobs in San Diego, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Clovis, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Bakersfield, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Santa Maria, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Susanville, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Fresno, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Corcoran, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Mendocino, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Burbank, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Hanford, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Merced, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Oakland, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Rialto, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Sacramento, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Madera, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Los Angeles, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in San Bernardino, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Chico, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Riverside, CARecreation Entry-level Jobs in Stockton, CAOther Categories of 2021 Entry-level JobsSummer Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAHealth Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAInternational Relations Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CATransportation Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAArchitecture Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAWedding Planning Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAReal Estate Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAEntry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAArt Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAGrocery Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAVirtual Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAFinance Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAPublishing Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CABusiness Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAConstruction Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAHealthcare Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAResearch Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAPhysical Therapy Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CADietetician Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAGeology Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAApply to jobs.
