You don't have to cam up if they want to call. I don't have a camera on my desktop.As long as they pay through Upwork, I'm OK with Skype calls. Actually, I get GoToMeeting, Hangouts, all kinds of chats.Some people just prefer talking than typing. It's OK if you don't want to, just some people won't be happy with it.2 KudosReplyCommunity GuruHanna N Member Since: Jun 17, 2015Mark as NewBookmarkSubscribeSubscribe to RSS FeedPermalinkPrintEmail to a FriendReport Inappropriate Content3 of 12Oct 6, 2015 03:08:40 PM by Hanna NI have added clients on Skype without a second thought, since I can always block them later if it becomes necessery.My honest thoughts? Based on personal experience, it is very likely that in this case, you were a bit too cautious and missed out on a job, as there are clients that want to for example verify the contractor is who they say they are with a Skype call, or it might be their prefered method of communication and they want to make sure you are familiar with it and available on Skype if needed.However, also based on my personal experience, a client that straighout thinks you are being a pain for being cautious - especially if they reply in an arsy tone to a polite request you've made - has a high chance of being a difficult client anyway, so I would not cry over this cup of spilled milk.5 KudosReplyCommunity GuruPandora H Member Since: May 11, 2010Mark as NewBookmarkSubscribeSubscribe to RSS FeedPermalinkPrintEmail to a FriendReport Inappropriate ContentBEST ANSWER4 of 12Oct 6, 2015 03:17:31 PM by Pandora HWhile I can't speak for every niche where an audio Skype interview is common, it is VERY common in mine.I don't know, off hand, what services the OP offers, so here are some further ideas to help readers decide on this in further possible jobs.Possible Reasons for an Audio Interview1. Client is not a good typer2. Client is physically unable to type3. Client speaks faster then they type (which is a common reason for audio interviews)Things to watch out for - Pervert Clients1. They INSIST on Skype to Skype Webcam2. They appear on cam without a shirt/clothes3. The job description asks for customer service, client-facing webcam meetings (doubtful, but not unheard of)Niches where Audio Interviews Are CommonNote: sometimes this is related to language/accent, and other times it's just the nature of the job.1. Customer Service2. Transcribing3. Project Managment / Team Mangement4. Executive Assistant5.

I just tell them I like escrow and we use Elance or Upwork. They say \"cool\" and we just use escrow. Most of the time they do it so I'll come down by 10% in price.1 KudoReply« Previous12Next »Helpful TipsFeatured Contributor MikkoLearn more about our awesome Community member Mikko!Learn MoreHelpful TipsProject Catalog™ now available globally!We're thrilled to announce that Project Catalog is now officially live for the entire Upwork community - talent and clients alike.Learn MoreHelpful TipsMore Connects to win more work!We're upgrading Connects to give you free monthly Connects and bonus Connects for interviews you win.Learn MoreHelpful TipsDirect Contracts now support hourly jobsDirect Contracts has expanded to now include contracts that require an hourly breakdown of their work on a recurring basis.Learn MoreFeatured ContributorCommunity GuruMikko RMember since Dec 26, 201510 Solutions178 Kudos249 PostsTOP SOLUTION AUTHORSUserCountpetra_r59prestonhunter24martina_plaschka8feed_my_eyes6wlyonsatl4View AllTOP KUDOED MEMBERSUserCountpetra_r387prestonhunter178feed_my_eyes147lysis1093gilbert-phyllis82View AllAbout UsCommunityTrust & SafetyHelp & SupportTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyDesktop AppCookie PolicyEnterprise SolutionsMobile© 2015 - Upwork® Global Inc.Chat with Community Bot"
