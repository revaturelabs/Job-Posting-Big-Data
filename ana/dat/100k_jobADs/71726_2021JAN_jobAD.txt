Americans are also concerned about the Obama administration's reliance on government spending to solve the nation's problems and the growing federal budget deficit. ... Of the post-World War II presidents, Obama now is the fourth fastest to drop below the majority approval level, doing so in his 10th month on the job.Today's news comes on the heels of the Quinnipiac poll released earlier this week that showed Obama's approval rating had slipped to 48% and a Fox News poll that put the figure at 46%.But while those polls surveyed only registered voters, Gallup's calculation is based on a broader sample of Americans, making it the most significant to date.DownloadCalling all HuffPost superfans!Sign up for membership to become a founding member and help shape HuffPost's next chapterJoin HuffPostDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?
