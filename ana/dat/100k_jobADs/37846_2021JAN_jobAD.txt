They fixed the problem and also completely cleaned out gutters (which were heavily clogged up) and cleaned the conservatory roof. They always kept me completely informed of what was wrong and what they would do to fix it. They guarantee to return if the problem does come back. Thoroughly nice guys who obviously knew what they were doing.
