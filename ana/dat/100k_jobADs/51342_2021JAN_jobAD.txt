If your builder or tiler hasn‚Äôt sealed your floor, he‚Äôs done something wrong ‚Äì and it can cause significant problems. To the untrained eye, it may be difficult to tell whether a floor has been sealed, but you will quickly see that an unsealed floor attracts a lot of ingrained dirt and loses its lustre easily over time.This was a problem for one of my recent customers, who lives in Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire. They have a Slate tiled Kitchen floor which had been laid approximately 5 years prior, but had not been sealed properly on installation ‚Äì and had not received any professional treatment since.Consequently, the floor had become difficult for the customer to keep clean and it had lost its lustre and coloration due to ingrained dirt. Additionally, recent building works had left thick deposits of plaster on the tiles.Cleaning a Dirty Slate Tiled KitchenTo begin restoring the Slate tiles, I applied Tile Doctor Pro-Clean, which is a powerful alkaline-based cleaner for natural stone. I mixed a strong dilution of the product, spread it liberally across the area and left it to dwell for 20 minutes to seep into the pores of the stone.Next, I scrubbed it into the stone using a brush fitted to a heavy weight rotary machine, before rinsing the floor with a high-pressure water and wet extraction unit.The next stage of the cleaning process was to get rid of the plaster deposits and some of the heavier stains. To deal with these I needed to apply an even stronger cleaner, known as NanoTech HBU (Heavy Build-Up Remover).As its name suggests, the product uses nano-sized cleaning particles to penetrate beneath difficult stains to dissolve them and lift them out. I did this in combination with a steamer to help loosen up some of the plaster.Sealing a Slate Tiled KitchenAfter allowing the floor to dry overnight, I returned to the property the next day to seal the tiles. I did this using five coats of Tile Doctor Seal and Go, which is a double-action sealer: not only does it provide a robust, topical seal, it also provides a durable low-sheen finish which is aesthetically pleasing.The sealer has done a fantastic job of emphasising all the natural colours in the Slate and the appearance of the entire floor has been lifted. The customer was really pleased with the restoration which certainly had been a long time coming.Restoration of a Dirty and Stained Slate Tiled Kitchen Floor in Buckinghamshire=================================By Jack DayPosted on January 1, 2000 September 7, 2020 Posted in Aylesbury Tile Cleaning, Bicester Tile Cleaning, Bletchley Tile Cleaning, Brackley Tile Cleaning, Buckingham Tile Cleaning, Ceramic Tile Cleaning, Encaustic Cement Tile Cleaning, Fireplace Cleaning, Flagstone Tile Cleaning, Great Horwood Tile Cleaning, Grout Cleaning, Leighton Buzzard Tile Cleaning, Limestone Tile Cleaning and Polishing, Marble Tile Cleaning, Milton Keynes Tile Cleaning, Newport Pagnell Tile Cleaning, Olney Tile Cleaning, Porcelain Tile Cleaning, Quarry Tile Cleaning, Sandstone Tile Cleaning, Slate Tile Cleaning, Stewkley Tile Cleaning, Stony Stratford Tile Cleaning, Terracotta Tile Cleaning, Terrazzo Floor Cleaning, Travertine Tile Cleaning, Victorian Tile Cleaning, Vinyl Tile Cleaning, Winslow Tile Cleaning, Work by Category, Work by Location, Work History	North Buckinghamshire Tile DoctorTile Doctor North BuckinghamshireOperated by Jack Day North-Buckinghamshire@tiledoctor.co.uk 0345 512 0122Connect with usRecent PostsWorking Through COVID-19 March 23, 2020Terracotta Tiled Floor Refurbished in Amersham Council Building January 8, 2018Restoring a Poorly Sealed Slate Kitchen Tiled Floor in Milton Keynes July 20, 2017Porcelain Tiled Kitchen and Hallway Refresh in Leighton Buzzard July 19, 2017Travertine Kitchen Floor Tiles Transformed in Aylesbury March 20, 2017Tile Cleaning and Grout Re-Colouring of a Porcelain Tiled Kitchen in Buckingham March 3, 2017Old Terracotta floor refurbished in Shenley Brook End February 15, 2017TestimonialsAn excellent service. Obviously knowledgable, turning up promptly each day and working hard to get the job done. At the first consultation and on the assessment of the floor they were honest about what could realistically be achieved with some of the dirtier / more damaged tiles. Even these came up better than expected and the overall finish was excellent. Very pleased with the end result and would highly recommend.Mr D, Milton KeynesJack did a great job restoring our old quarry tile floor.
