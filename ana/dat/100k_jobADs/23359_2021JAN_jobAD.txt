(Pregnant women are not legally obligated to disclose their pregnancy, and it’s illegal for an employer to discriminate against them.) Columbus’ decision was further influenced by the ample disdain for the previous working mom in the role, with an interviewer saying that she had been “much less present” after having a baby.via Nikki Columbus Says Job at MoMA PS1 Was Rescinded After BabyAdvertisementsShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)RelatedPosted in Equality of Opportunity, Gender Equality	Published by mcequalityView all posts by mcequality	Post navigation‹ PreviousMisogyny hate crime in Nottinghamshire gives ‘shocking’ results – BBC NewsNext ›World Cup 2018: Smuggling the Pride flag into Russia – BBC NewsLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
