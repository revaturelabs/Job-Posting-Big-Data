Either sending an invoice or marking it as sent will remove it from draft status.

Quotes that are awaiting response are quotes where you are waiting on a reply from the client, quotes will stay in this status until they are approved (either by you or the client) or changes are requested. Approved quotes have been given the green light either by the client via the client hub or manually approved by a team member.You can click New Quote in the top right of this section to open the quote creation screen.Time SheetsThe time sheets section will show the three most recent time sheet entries.
