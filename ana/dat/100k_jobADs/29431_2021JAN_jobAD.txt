If you’d like to know my day of the week rankings if they were metaphors for real-life people, here they are:SaturdayFridaySundayWednesdayThursdayMondayTuesdayMonday and I get along okay, though I’d never go out to coffee with Monday. But Tuesday is inevitably, necessarily, evil. I’m convinced Tuesday would murder me in my sleep if given the opportunity. But you’re not here to talk about anthropomorphized days of the week! You’re here to talk about the awesome thing that happened a couple days ago. You know, the Zelda thing!I’m just blown away! Hyrule: See the Sights! Hear the Sounds! has absolutely been a success, garnering lots of great praise in the form of comments and tweets. People seem to really enjoy the art, personal stories, and particularly the music.I briefly considered “DLC” for the Hyrule post, where people who didn’t know about it could submit stories of their own and I’d make them individual posts in the same style. However, I think I’ll hold off on that in case I ever want to put together a Hyrule: See the Sights, Hear the Sounds Again! Quality over quantity is always the correct course of action.You should know that I have a nearly completed plan for another interesting collaboration, in the works. I intend to announce full plans for it sometime next week, though I want to give Hyrule contributors first dibs. It took precisely three months (April 11 – July 11) from planning to completion of this one, so I would expect an October release date for the next one. More information to follow.Anyway, it’s Nice Job Badge time! These are five blog links from this week that deserve a high-five and a “nice job!”THINGS:If someone makes an amazing post one week, then makes another the next, I will feature them two weeks in a row.I will not typically feature the same blogger twice on one list, unless I’m really blown away.The posts will all loosely be from the current seven day period.They are in no particular order because they’re all great.Hey, you should totally put the badge on your recognized piece with a pingback to this post!Friend Breakups | A City Girl StoryAs you get older, you will have those friends that suddenly just faded out of your life. You remember the last time you talk to them, at the end of March. You remember the last time you saw them, October. Nothing went down, you both just kind of faded apart and no one has reached out.I don’t believe I’ve ever featured this talented blogger before, but A City Girl Story writes a compelling piece on friend breakups. There is an argument to be made that waning friendships are worse than romantic breakups, and while I don’t think it’s that way in every situation, I do think relationship destruction is always a tragedy. This piece is well-worth the read.Wings of Will | The Rendezvous Cluband with broken wingswe can flyfor it’s the wings that’s brokenand not our will.It’s been a while since I’ve given The Rendezvous Club a badge, and I see they’ve changed their name… by capitalizing the C. Well, despite some of the mystery being gone, this is one fantastic poem! It’s hard to explain what makes poetry good, but with consistent quality like this in my reader, I find myself appreciate the short-form arts more and more. Very cool!July 10: Pictures I Took Today | Zombie FlamingoesI was only going to go out for a short walk, but went out for almost 2 hours, enjoying my first time shooting with the 80-200mm zoom lens. What fun!There is, of course, short-form art I do like — photography! I’m a bit of a photographer myself, even doing a wedding last month. But honestly, these pictures are great! I particularly like the black and white ones! As a fan of very colorful photography, that’s not a phrase I say everyday.Pictures from Price, Utah to Colorado | megisacatLeaving Utah and entering Colorado (the landscape changes drastically)… It started to get dark and rainy as we drove in further and then of course it suddenly cleared up (as Colorado weather does)Speaking of fantastic photography, Meg is always a reliable source of it. She combines travel with great pictures, and I always find myself wishing I were where she is. This time, we get to see the subtle environmental shifts between states — something she expresses eloquently with her pictures. And then, as a bonus, there is hummus. Hummus is an automatic bonus point.The Entire Cast of Hyrule: See the Sights! Hear the Sounds!Special thanks to these amazing bloggers for the amount of time and effort put into this collaboration.
