"Onward: My new job at Publish2 ‚Äì Ryan SholinSkip to contentRyan SholinThat guy you know from the Internet, probably.‚ò∞ MenuHomeAboutWorkSpeakingTwitterLinkedInOnward: My new job at Publish2Posted on April 23, 2009 by Ryan Sholin	I am extremely excited to let you know that I‚Äôm starting a new job on Monday, as Director of News Innovation at Publish2. I‚Äôll be working for Scott Karp, who I‚Äôve been following since I started blogging back in 2005, and with a team of top-notch online news thinkers, evangelists, and developers.What does a Director of News Innovation do?I‚Äôm expecting to work with newsrooms and journalists across the media world to get them the tools they need to bring the best of the Web to their readers, and maybe even to bring the best of their readers to the wider Web. Sound good?Well, help me out. Let me know what you think of Publish2, how you‚Äôve used it, and what you‚Äôd like to see in the P2 toolkit that isn‚Äôt there yet.Here‚Äôs my favorite recent Publish2 story, about how a group of disparate news organizations in Washington state used the service as a tool for collaborative curation during floods this winter.I can‚Äôt wait to get started. Matter of fact, if you‚Äôre at BCNI Philly this weekend, feel free to throw your ideas about Publish2 at me in person.+++To answer an obvious question, yes, I‚Äôve left my job at GateHouse Media, effective today.I had a great 19-month run with GateHouse, doing my best to give journalists at more than 125 newspapers the tools and training they needed to serve their communities.Any and every success that I had there belongs to the incredible team of developers, the awesome revenue team, and the online news innovators I worked with, including Howard Owens ‚Äî who hired me and has since left GateHouse to put his money where his mouth is at The Batavian ‚Äî and Bill Blevins, the VP who Howard reported to, whose door was always wide open to new ideas and possibilities. Thank you.+++Onward. I‚Äôll be spending a great deal of my time over the coming days and week wrapping my head around how Publish2 has been used so far and where it‚Äôs going. Let me know what you think of it, here, on Twitter, or wherever you see me. I‚Äôm easy to find.Like this:Like Loading...Posted in MediaTagged career path, collaboration, curation, linking-behavior, publish2, work	Published by Ryan SholinView all posts by Ryan Sholin	Post navigationPrevious Post In Defense of Eye Candy ‚Äì A List ApartNext Post P2: The New Prologue ‚Äì WordPress.com11 thoughts on ‚ÄúOnward: My new job at Publish2‚Äù	Jaclyn	 April 23, 20095:12 pm	 Reply	Congrats on the new gig, sounds really great! I‚Äôve read tons about Publish2, but haven‚Äôt actually spent a lot of time on the site and don‚Äôt yet have an account. But after reading your announcement and looking around the site, I think I might be convinced to sign up and learn my way around it.LikeLikeDaniel	 April 23, 20096:43 pm	 Reply	Congratulations, man. Gatehouse, I‚Äôm sure, is sad to see you go. Publish2 is extremely lucky to get such a brilliant news mind.LikeLikeDaniel	 April 24, 20091:22 am	 Reply	Django app. üôÇ Congrats!LikeLikeDanny Sanchez	 April 24, 20097:23 am	 Reply	Congrats Ryan!

Glad you liked the #wanews project, too (that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve called it, occasionally).We‚Äôve got a conference call scheduled in relation to the project that‚Äôs taking place May 5 and it‚Äôs open to all who‚Äôd like to listen in. Josh Korr from Publish2 will be joining us to offer a Publish2 primer for the uninitiated.Anyway, really excited to see what you do with Publish2 (I‚Äôm also a huge fan of Wired Journalists). Best of luck to you.LikeLikeDigidave	 April 25, 20092:01 am	 Reply	al;skdfjl;askdjf;lsakjdf;lk!!!!!!Do you know how excited I am for this!!!!!I hope Scott Karp knows how much of a steal you are!!!LikeLikePatrick Beeson	 April 27, 20093:11 pm	 Reply	Congrats Ryan!
