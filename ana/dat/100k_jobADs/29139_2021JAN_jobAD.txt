Engagement with the private sector - to leverage income, influence, innovation and core assets - has the potential to accelerate the achievement of UNICEF's strategic goals. Reporting to the Deputy Director, Operations and Finance, the Senior Project Manager (UNISON) will lead the development and implementation of a change management strategy, which will be one of the key enablers in the development and stewardship of private sector partnerships globally. The strategy will address internal communication, capacity development, opportunities for business and technology development, project design and management, and support for project governance. The Senior Project Manager (UNISON) will be responsible for all aspects of the UNISON Project, including as it expands to incorporate the business requirements of UNICEF’s Public Partnerships Division (PPD) and as development, maintenance and licensing arrangements for UNISON are transitioned, as an Enterprise Solution, to Information & Communication Technology Division (ICTD).Location: SwitzerlandDeadline: 1 Feb 2021 11:55 PMAccounting Officer, P-2, TA (364 days) # 115370, Copenhagen, DenmarkAccounting OfficerLocation: DenmarkDeadline: 31 Jan 2021 11:55 PMGeneric vacancy announcement: Child Protection Officer, NOBThe fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.Location: UkraineDeadline: 3 Feb 2021 11:55 PMRe-advertisement of National Consultancy, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the programme to provide acceptable and affordable sanitation solutions in the informal settlements of Windhoek, NamibiaUNICEF Namibia is looking for consulting service to conduct the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study together with the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to obtain an Environmental Clearance Certificate for providing acceptable and affordable sanitation solutions in the informal settlements of Windhoek.Location: NamibiaDeadline: 29 Jan 2021 11:55 PMExternal Adv: Planning Specialist, NO-C, Jakarta, Indonesia, Post# 68354, for indonesians onlyUNICEF Jakarta is looking for Planning Specialist who will assure the quality of child rights-based programmes through consistent and effective planning, design, implementation, monitoring and/or evaluation of programmes and projects.
