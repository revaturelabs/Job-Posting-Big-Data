Forward looking electronics companies need to sign-up to the UKESF programme and help address what is a national concern of strategic importance,” said Mukerjee.See: Q5 Interview - Indro Mukerjee, C-MAC MicroTechnologyRichard WilsonWednesday 27th January 2010Related newsSample Covering LetterWhat to take to an interviewSample CVGood questions to ask at an interviewPerfect your interview techniqueFacebookTwitterCANDIDATESMy CVFind jobsSearch recruitersRECRUITERSMy company profileManage jobsSearch CV'sGeneralAbout usContact usPrivacy policyTerms & conditionsPowered by JOBIQO"
