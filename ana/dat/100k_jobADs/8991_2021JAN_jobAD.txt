Before You Hand In Your Resignation LetterFirst things first. There are a few essential steps that you need to take before formally quitting your job. If you overlook these, not even a Pulitzer-worthy letter of resignation could help you save face — or your career.» Step 1: Get Your Finances in OrderIt is always best to have a job offer on standby before you quit your current position.However, if you must leave at short notice with no plan B lined up, then make sure that you have enough savings to get you through at least the next three to six months. It could take a while to find a new job, especially if you don’t want to sell yourself cheap and accept the first offer that comes your way. The last thing you want is to end up at yet another disappointing job that you can’t wait to quit even before your trial period is over.This step is particularly important if you have a family to provide for or loans or credits to repay.» Step 2: Plan Your TimingIdeally, you want to time announcing your resignation so that it does not coincide with:Busy periodsImportant projectsImpending deadlinesMajor changes in the workplaceIf you can, pick a slower period. That should help ease the transition and make it less stressful for everyone.» Step 3: Start Packing Your BelongingsMany people have quite the inventory crammed in their drawers or adorning their desktop at the office. Your last weeks and days at work can be hectic enough as they are. Don’t spend them fussing over what sized box you’d need to fit your specialty pen collection, the twenty photos of your iguana, and the five charcoal water bottles you never used anyway.To avoid all that hassle, start clearing and packing your personal items well before you announce your resignation. Moreover, try to be discreet about it. Remove your items one or two at a time so as not to attract undue attention.» Step 4: Clean Up Your Electronic DevicesDelete any personal files, emails, and messages from your work phone and PC. Don’t forget to save useful data or contact details that you might need in the future — just make sure that you are allowed to do it!» Step 5: Review Your Employment Contract and Company PolicyDig up your employment contract and double-check what the minimum notice period is. Most employers typically require two-weeks’ notice, but that is not always the case.In addition, familiarize yourself with your company’s policy regarding the leaving salary and benefits you are entitled to. Make sure to also research your continuing health insurance and pension plan as well as how to collect unused annual and sick leave.» Step 6: Talk to Your BossHanding in a resignation letter does not mean that you shouldn’t talk to your supervisor or manager face to face. Request a one-on-one conversation before formally submitting your resignation.At the meeting, be professional and courteous — even if you have your reasons not to be. If there is some bad blood between you two, be the bigger person and avoid saying anything negative.Start by telling your boss that you are leaving and when your last day is going to be. However, you don’t have to state your reasons for quitting unless you want to. Then, offer to help with the transition or training your replacement.That is also a good time to discuss your future and prepare the ground for networking. Let your boss know what your next job is or what you plan for your career. You might want to ask for a reference as well.III. How to Write a Short Notice Resignation LetterIf you find it helpful, think of it as your “leaving” motivation letter — the same general rules apply. Don’t go over one page: keep it short, simple, and to the point. Always stick to standard business letter format, opt for a professional-looking font such as Arial or Times New Roman 12, and use high-quality stationery.➤ What to Include in a Short Notice Resignation LetterHere is what should go in the letter from top to bottom:Your name and contact detailsThe dateYour employer’s name and contact detailsA subject line that says “Resignation” followed by your nameA salutation followed by the addressee’s name or surnameFirst paragraph: say that you are resigning and when your last day is going to beSecond paragraph: apologize for the short notice and state the reason for leaving and where you will be going next (optional)Third paragraph: offer to help with the transitionFourth paragraph: thank your employer and wish them successFifth paragraph: state your new contact details (if any) and how they can reach you from now onClosingYour hand-written signatureYour typed nameCC to HR and other interested partiesDoes all that sound like quite the handful? Don’t worry — it’s much simpler than it seems. Let’s go over each of these points in turn.» Step 1: Type Your Name and Contact DetailsThese are pretty straightforward. Just make sure to put your up-to-date contact details and your preferred method of communication. Also, make sure to include your personal email address, as your work email account will soon be deactivated.» Step 2: Put the DateIf you draft your resignation letter a few days before handing it in, make sure to put the date of submission and not that of writing.It is good practice to write the name of the month in full to avoid confusion, i.e., “June” rather than “06.”Make sure to also follow the standard formula depending on where your employer is based. In American English, the month goes first, i.e., “February 7, 2020.” The opposite is true for British English, where the month follows the day: “10 November 2020.”» Step 3: Type Your Employer’s Name and Contact DetailsLikewise, nothing to discuss here. Just make sure to put your employer’s or the company’s full name — it is a mark of respect and professionalism.» Step 4: Write the Subject LineA simple “Resignation — [Your full name]” subject line should do just fine.» Step 5: Open with a SalutationUse the standard “Dear [Name]” formula. It’s fine to use the person’s first name if that is how you normally address them. Depending on your workplace, the appropriate addressee of the letter may be your direct supervisor or someone higher up the management chain.Don’t forget that in American English, honorifics are punctuated, i.e., “Mr. Smith” or “Dr. Singh.” On the other hand, the period is typically omitted in British English, i.e., “Ms Mueller” or “Prof Rossi.”» Step 6: Announce Your Resignation and Last DayStart by announcing your resignation and your last day at work right away.Make sure that the notice you give is in keeping with your employment contract. That, however, is not always possible. You may have to give shorter notice or none at all in situations such as a family or health emergency, or if you are subjected to abuse or harassment at work.In that case, it is advisable to disclose your reasons for leaving at least in part. That could help you avoid potential conflicts with your employer or even legal or financial liability.» Step 7: Apologize, State Your Reasons, and Say Where You Will Be Going NextYou should always apologize for quitting your job at very short notice — it is the polite thing to do.However, as mentioned above, as long as you give the notice required under the contract, you are not under an obligation to disclose your reasons for leaving. Of course, you may do so if you wish. Common reasons for resignation include:Starting a new jobSwitching careersGoing back to schoolTaking a gap year or sabbaticalGoing on extended travelsPregnancy, childbirth, or adoptionOther family reasonsHealth reasonsRelocating to another city, state, or countryRetirementIn any case, however, refrain from going into too much detail. A single line on the page should more than suffice.» Step 8: Offer to Help with the TransitionNext, show some empathy and understanding. Acknowledge that your resignation could mean that your employer and coworkers may have to go through a rough patch. Therefore, be gracious and offer to help ease the transition. Examples include training your successor and taking on extra tasks in your last few weeks or days.» Step 9: Thank Your Employer and Wish Them SuccessTowards the end, remember to always thank your employer for the opportunities they gave you and everything you have learned on the job. Referring to something specific, such as a particular project or skill, would be a nice extra touch, but you don’t have to go that far if you don’t actually mean it.End this paragraph by wishing your employer and the company success in their future endeavors. You may also mention that you would be happy to work together again in the future. That would prepare the ground for future networking opportunities and eliminate any awkwardness if your professional paths cross again.» Step 10: Include Your New Contact DetailsBefore closing, make sure that you include your new contact details and a forwarding address for any paperwork or paychecks. That is also a good place to indicate your preferred channel of communication.» Step 11: Close and Sign OffSign off your resignation letter with your preferred closing, such as “Best,” “Regards,” “Sincerely,” or “Warmly.” In any case, however, keep it business-like and formal. You can reserve the more casual closings for your leaving email.Finally, type and hand-sign your name. It’s best to use a high-quality pen, and maybe practice your signature a few times if you haven’t signed anything in a while.» Step 12: Send a Copy to HRLeave two to four blank lines under your signature. Then, type “CC:” followed by the names and titles of everyone who will receive a copy of your letter of resignation.➤ What NOT to Include in a Short Notice Resignation LetterYour short notice resignation letter should not contain:Too much detailAnything negativePromises that you cannot or will not keepWitty comments and jokesSensitive personal information— Too Much DetailKeep your letter short and sweet. You may mention the reasons why you are leaving but don’t expand on the future. Don’t discuss your retirement plans, the details of your next job, or the dream trip of a lifetime that you will be taking.Likewise, thank your employer for your work together, but do not start reminiscing over the good old times. Save your anecdotes and office war stories for the farewell drinks.— Anything NegativeEven if you are ecstatic and relieved to be leaving what may have been a toxic or stifling workplace, your resignation letter is not the place to vent — save that for the bar or your therapist’s couch.Stay away from negative or passive-aggressive comments, as well as anything that could reflect poorly on you later. Remember that your letter of resignation will be kept indefinitely in your employment file. You never know — it may come back to haunt you one day.— Promises That You Cannot or Will Not KeepIt is a good idea to offer to help with the transition at your workplace or to train your replacement. However, don’t overpromise and don’t make commitments that you won’t be able to keep. If you know that you have too much on your plate as it is, don’t volunteer to take on more tasks.Moreover, don’t promise to continue cooperating with your current employer even after you leave, unless you are 100% certain that you could do that.— Witty Comments and JokesAs we mentioned above, your letter of resignation will likely be kept permanently in your employment file. Therefore, err on the side of caution and keep your writing strictly professional. There is a place and time for humor and a good laugh, but your resignation letter is not it.— Sensitive Personal InformationEven if you are good friends with your boss and colleagues and have been working side by side for decades, refrain from including confidential personal information in your resignation letter. That includes any medical diagnoses, your new salary, or details about the personal life of your family members.IV.
