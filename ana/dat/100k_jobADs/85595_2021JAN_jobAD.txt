I flicked it onto \"keep all\" to see if that fires it up.LynnLoggedadminAdministratorForum SuperheroPosts: 3208Re: Auto job log stopped working« Reply #3 on: June 12, 2009, 03:11:41 PM »How are you opening the job log folder? If you are just clicking the \"Recall\" button, there's another factor involved here. I think your jobs were probably saved and Qimage is just looking in the wrong (old, based on the old version) folder. What happens is that versions 2009.250 and later moved the job log folder, BUT... the recall dialog is designed to open the last folder that was used so it could still be pointing to the old job log folder and not showing the new files if you use \"Recall\". Try this:(1) Click \"File\", \"Open Automated Job Log\". Doing it this way, it should go to the new job log folder.(2) If not, click the \"Go to job log folder\" button at the top of the dialog (printer icon).MikeLoggedLynnNewbiePosts: 7Re: Auto job log stopped working« Reply #4 on: June 12, 2009, 04:28:31 PM »Hello Mike,\"File\", \"Open Automated Job Log\". This is the only way I have ever accessed the auto job log. So I don't expect that the glitch is here.LynnLoggedPages: [1]Print« previous next »Jump to: Please select a destination: ----------------------------- Forum Rules, Status, and Info ----------------------------- => Welcome + Rules => Forum Feedback, Status, Issues, etc. => Who is Mike Chaney? ----------------------------- Technical Discussions ----------------------------- => Articles => Cameras => Camera Accessories => Printers => Printer Media => Computer Software => Computer Hardware => General Photography Discussion ----------------------------- Mike's Software ----------------------------- => FlashPipe => Qimage => Qimage Ultimate => Qimage Ultimate Wish List => Qimage Ultimate Challenges => Qimage Studio Edition => Profile Prism => TT DynoPowered by SMF 1.1.21 | SMF © 2015, Simple MachinesLoading..."
