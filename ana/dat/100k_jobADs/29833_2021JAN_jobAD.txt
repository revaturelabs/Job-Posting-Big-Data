"The Rachel Berry Blog: {Fun... It's A Dirty Job}Wednesday, August 06, 2008{Fun... It's A Dirty Job}Well, I never thought this next sentence would cross my lips, but I kinda miss my missile testing dirt piles. Looking back with hindsight it was a great entertainer for the la' boys with energy. But alas Mr Backhoe came last week and back filled everything so the boys beloved dirt jump is no more. What is it with boys big/small & dirt?Oh the bathroom trim is almost done then I need to paint the wall next to it. So much to do, so much to do. But on the up side we will be going to Tri-Cities again this weekend so I will be able to go into a real fabric store so I can dress my TV cabinet. Ahhh the sweet smell of cotton all around, I can hardly wait.Pin ItPosted by Rachel Berry at 5:23 PMEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels: The 5 Crazies10 comments:Nicole August 6, 2008 at 6:02 PMIs that all your yard? It's huge, how fun. My kids would have been in heaven in all that dirt! Cute Pictures!ReplyDeleteRepliesReplycherry August 6, 2008 at 10:07 PMRofl....I don't know what it is...but my dh..I swear moves around the same dirt pile from one side of our property to the other. What type of camara do you have? The photos are great. Can't wait to see what fabric you choose. I know what it is like to have to wait to go the the \"big city\" to get what you want. cherryReplyDeleteRepliesReplyUnknown August 6, 2008 at 11:07 PMIt's great to see my big brother has not lost his biking talents - what an animal! I am glad ALL of the kids had fun. ;)(Do they still farm that field?)ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyLee August 7, 2008 at 6:22 AMEvery picture is so good I can't pick a favorite.....well, ok, if I MUST....the last one! CLASSIC.You know, I can picture a layout for a scrapbook for that very picture yet I don't scrapbook. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? I really need to just dive in and do it, huh?Your family is precious. And just fyi, if there is a dirt hill in smelling distance of my boys, they are in it, rolling, digging, adding water, and ultimately it's all over my house.Thanks for stopping by my blog which has been sorely neglected. :)ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyLee August 7, 2008 at 6:25 AMp.s.I love your kids names. So much, in fact, that I suggested every one of them to my very pregnant sister who is struggling with names this time around.Also, good luck fabric shopping. I wonder if fabric stores are to us what hardware stores are to our hubbies? It's the smell, I agree. YUM. Have fun!ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAre You Serious! August 7, 2008 at 8:45 AM♥ Great pictures!
