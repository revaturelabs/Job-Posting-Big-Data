"my pointless: give me your cash. can I have a job?Pagescurrent pointlessnessabout my pointlessThursday, November 5, 2009give me your cash. can I have a job?Most people know that if you want to get a job, there are some things you should do and not do in the application process. For example:--do dress appropriately--do be confident but not cocky--don't put out your cigarette on the boss' desk.Things like that.Last week, a man in Harverstraw, NY, had a novel approach to applying for a job. The man entered the local Taco Bell, pointed a gun at the cashier and demanded money.After the robbery attempt, the robber didn't make a get-away. Instead, he immediately went into the manager's office and asked for a job application.The manager refused to give him an application. So, the robber left Taco Bell without an application and without any money. It is not clear if the man chose not to take the money or simply forgot it.Police are looking for the man.http://snipr.com/t2bry [www_foxnews_com]Labels: jobs, stupid criminal, taco bellPosted by FriendinME at 11/05/2009 12:05:00 AMNo comments:Post a CommentNewer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)welcome to my pointless: a useless collection of nothing and everythingsearch my pointlessmy pointless label cloud01 my favorite posts- video (19) 02 my favorite posts- newspaper clips (5) 03 my favorite posts- weird news (18) 04 my favorite posts- stupid criminals (9) 05 my favorite posts- advertisements (6) 06 my favorite posts- one year ago (2) 09 my favorite posts- general (5) 5 second movies (3) 911 emergency (18) accident (49) accident- auto (27) advertisements (141) airplane (12) allergy (6) amazing feats (52) animals (98) art (35) automobile (67) awkward family photos (3) bacon (3) bank robbery (28) before and after (11) Beyonce (3) Bill Dance (3) birds (13) bloopers (57) Brian Regan (4) buildings (16) business cards (2) business names (13) cakes (4) cartoon (4) cemetery (5) children (21) Christmas (25) church signs (7) classifieds (39) commercials (10) computers (12) counterproductive ads (5) Craig's List (2) creepy (9) criminal sketches (6) diet (8) disguise (14) dog (33) ears (5) Easter (4) engaged to wed (23) engrish (24) events (8) failblog (26) family photos (2) food (39) football (soccer) (12) for sale (51) galleries (51) greatness remembered (4) grocery (14) gross (24) guitar (8) hair (11) headlines (41) headlines of the obvious (11) housekeeping (14) illusion (12) innovative ads (6) interesting facts (27) interviews (5) ironic (17) jobs (20) just fun (45) just stupid (154) kiss (3) labels (16) lawsuits (15) lawyer (8) laziness (7) marriage (15) mascot (3) medical (46) meme (1) menu (13) military (5) misprints (15) mother (20) motorcycle (7) music (27) names (37) newspaper clips (192) oblivious (14) obvious (25) octopus (5) odd business combinations (4) odd products (22) odd signs (48) ouch (18) overloaded (8) overprotection (10) pants (11) parking (10) pets (31) phobia (3) photoshop problems (13) picture (146) planning (10) police blotter (55) politically correct (4) politics (2) poll (5) Pomplamoose (3) poster (13) pranks (30) real estate (8) redneck (8) relationships (50) repost from old blog (15) restaurant (8) revenge (8) rhett and link (7) safety on the road (10) school (24) science (16) sexist ads (7) slideshow (41) slowmo (5) smuggler (8) soccer (11) space (7) sports (63) stories (34) stupid criminal (138) subway (4) taco bell (3) tattoo (17) television (17) texting (2) toilet (13) traffic signs (7) travel (10) uncatagorically pointless (112) unfortunate picture placement (12) unusual people (43) uplifting (10) valuable coupons (7) video (354) vintage ads (13) Walmart (8) warning (18) web clip (14) weird history (2) weird news (285) wisdom (15) workplace safety (15) world record (19)my pointless archive► 2012 (32)► July (1)► June (4)► May (27)► 2010 (347)► October (1)► September (8)► August (20)► July (42)► June (58)► May (40)► April (44)► March (47)► February (43)► January (44)▼ 2009 (572)► December (46)▼ November (43)horrible criminal sketch leads to arrest.a driver who doesn't understand physics.some good news for Thanksgiving Daytoo ugly to be a criminal?the perfect undercover agent. or notcome on backitems that probably won't be purchased by the rich...headlines that make you wonder (part 2)911?
