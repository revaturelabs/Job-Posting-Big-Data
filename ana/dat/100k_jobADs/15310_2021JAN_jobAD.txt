Despite the promise of this technology, there is currently no way to replicate many tissue functions because there is no reliable way to replicate the cell configurations found in real-life organs. This project aims to develop innovative technologies using microscale forces (acoustic, electrical, hydrodynamic, etc.) to manipulate at the microscale to create functional human tissues with a view toward creating therapies and research tools.This interdisciplinary project lies at the intersection of Biomedical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Microfluidics. Prospective students with experience or special interest in:cell culture;3D printing;microfabrication;biomedical technology;computer simulation; andmicroscale physicsare encouraged to apply.Successful applicants will be expected to conduct research at a high level and publish in internationally recognized journals. Students will be given wide latitude to determine specific methods and research directions that serve the project goals.More InformationAdditional InformationBenefitsThe living allowance is >$30,000 per year for up to 3.5 years for students undertaking a doctoral degree.Selection processApplication: Please send your CV, academic transcript and brief overview of relevant experience to david.collins@unimelb.edu.au. If judged suitable, applicants will be selected for a video interview. Applicants should be prepared to write a research proposal on their research plans. Prospective students must meet University of Melbourne eligibility criteria to be awarded a PhD scholarship.Visit this link for more details on scholarship eligibility and application information:https://scholarships.unimelb.edu.au/awards/graduate-research-scholarshipsVisit www.davidjohncollins.comAdditional commentsThe applicant will be joining an interdisciplinary team of at least 6 other individuals in the Collins BioMicrosystems Laboratory, located in the heart of the Biosciences and Engineering precinct at the University of Melbourne. Melbourne is also home to the Melbourne Centre for Nanofabrication, the largest cleanroom nano/microfabrication facility in the southern hemisphere.The University of Melbourne is the highest-ranked institution in Australia (Times Higher Education) and is located in Melbourne, a diverse and cosmopolitan city that is widely regarded as one of the most livable cities in the world (Economist Intelligence Unit).RequirementsOffer RequirementsREQUIRED LANGUAGESENGLISH: ExcellentSkills/QualificationsApplicants are expected to have at least an undergraduate (4-year) degree in engineering, science or a related field.Scholarships are competitive, where only applicants who have scored highly from their degree (and/or have prior research experience) will be considered.Results from TOEFL/IELTS, etc. are required to prove English language skills for applicants whose first language is not English. This requirement is generally waived for this whose primary language of instruction at University has been in English.Work location(s)2 position(s) available atUniversity of MelbourneAustraliaVictoriaThe University of Melbourne3010203 Bouverie StreetEURAXESS offer ID: 472646Print this offerDisclaimer:The responsibility for the jobs published on this website, including the job description, lies entirely with the publishing institutions.
