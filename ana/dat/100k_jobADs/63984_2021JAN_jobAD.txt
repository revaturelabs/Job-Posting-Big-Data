In addition, the brand new minister evokes associations with a naughty boy who gets a scolding, so that all attention goes to him rather than to the heated speech of the president. Various suggestions are already being made on social media about what was going through the man’s mind at the time: “what if I resigned now?” “I should have studied childcare!” and the ironic “best day ever!” are just a few of the suggestions that come up.NervousAccording to behavioral and body language expert Enrique Rosas of the Knesix Institute, Herrera’s avoidance of eye contact and the blinking of his eyes – about 60 times per minute instead of about 15 times per minute, which is normal – indicates an increased state of nervousness.Acepté la renuncia de Carlos Urzúa, secretario de Hacienda y para sustituirlo he nombrado al subsecretario Arturo Herrera Gutiérrez, quien es un profesional en Economía, con virtudes de humanismo y honestidad. Es de toda mi confianza. pic.twitter.com/Qmhj4DF20v— Andrés Manuel (@lopezobrador_) July 9, 2019The discomfort of Herrera seems to increase as the president t alks longer: he swallows and shuffles a bit – all signs of discomfort, says Rosas. Critics of Lopez Obrador now describe Herrera’s uncomfortable facial expression as “the face of Mexico.”Lopez Obrador is still doing well in the polls. The president, who took office in December after a major victory, is still supported by a majority of the population.Excessive laughterAfterward, Herrera explained his convulsive attitude to the press by saying that he was “accused of laughing too much” in earlier positions. “That is why I am now trying to be more cautious at such solemn moments,” said the new Finance Minister.©Twitter: @Lopez_Obrador Arturo Herrera (right) is there like a boy who gets punished when the president announces his ministry.Share Afrinik post:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Related PostsCategories Global Tags Bizarre, Mexico Post navigationWoman sends holiday photo to parents but accidentally shows more than she wantedMother drives around with an inflatable swimming pool on the roof, with daughters in itLeave a Comment Cancel replyCommentName Email WebsiteSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.Search for:© 2021 Afrinik"
