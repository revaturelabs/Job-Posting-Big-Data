Would be surprised if they employed 15 people over the next 3 monthsReplyBen Selby says:	December 29, 2016 at 8:00 pm	Hi Ben,You’re not completely wrong. We are new to the area and if the right people come along, 15 people employed in the next 3 months is also about right, but over the next 12 months we will certainly be looking to employ 40 people in the area. If you think you’ve got what it takes to be an outstanding carer and make a difference, then please do get in touch.ReplyLeave a Reply CancelYour email address will not be published.
