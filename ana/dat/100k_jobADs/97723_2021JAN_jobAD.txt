I wish you all the best wherever you are.I recently ended about 3 months of isolation with a little run of shows. I’ve always loved performing music but absence has definitely made the heart grow fonder and it’s been a huge pleasure to get back to this job of mine (even if this period of re-opening may be short-lived?)The title of this blog has a double meaning for me. I wanted to talk about the love of my job but also ponder on the job or the purpose of music itself? What is music for, what does it achieve?Last Friday I performed (in unplugged style) with ‘Rumours’ the Fleetwood Mac tribute show. I’ve been singing in that show for more than 10 years now and it’s one of my favourite things to do. Now I’m going to make a confession here: before I performed with this band, I wasn’t particularly a Fleetwood Mac fan – please forgive me! Learning all the songs before my first ever show with the band certainly gave me a push along the path to becoming a fan but it was during those first few performances, seeing the audience come alive with the sounds of the songs they knew and loved, hearing stories from people about what the songs meant to them…that’s when I ‘got’ it.During my time performing with the show, I have met a couple of Rhiannons and quite a few Saras named after those iconic Mac tunes, and I’ve seen how hearing a particular song can trigger memories and emotions for people – of love, loss and everything in between. One of the regular shows we do has become a homage to a lost friend for their community because a gig of ours was one of their last moments together.Even in these current restrictions, where dancing and singing (from the audience) is not allowed, it’s still a privilege – maybe more than ever – to be part of this job of music, to be a messenger.All the best,AmandaPS. I go ‘live’ on my Facebook page www.facebook.com/AmandaEaston every week, 11am Tuesdays and 7.30pm Thursdays (Sydney AEST) for a diary-style chat. I’m also about to schedule some music livestreams, so please stay tuned for details.
