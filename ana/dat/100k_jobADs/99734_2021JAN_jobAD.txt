I have experience on USA Swimming's National Age Group Development Committee and I have 12 years of experience in the sport. I am a fast learner and can adapt to any club's values and needs. I work well with groups of all ages and want to contribute to a team's culture in a very impactful way. I am a hard worker and I am willing to put in extra time to be successful. I am going to be balancing any coaching with school in the second semester. However, given the probability of online learning, I will be very flexible.Seeking Coaching Positions for Spring Semester Saint Paul, MN, USAAug 27, 2020John P BarnesTo Whom it may Concern, I would like to introduce myself; my name is John Barnes and I would like to further my career with your organization. I feel that with my dedication, loyalty, and work ethic I would be an asset to your organization. I’ve been fortunate enough to have the opportunity of working in athletics for over 30 years along with 5 years as Director of Community Relations. These areas are where I have acquired excellent interpersonal communication skills, as well as superb communication skills. I feel with my extensive knowledge of athletics, and advancement along with my competitive drive, I will excel within and be able to help the development/advancement of the club while building relationships within the community . My biggest strength I have developed over the years would be developing relationships that I feel are the cornerstone of coaching, sales and overall life. With my background along with my dedication, entrepreneurial mind-set, and excellent organizational skills I will be a beneficial addition to any organization. You can expect a competent professional that can work on complex interpersonal issues. I am relentlessly loyal, capable, and enthusiastic about demonstrating my abilities to you.
