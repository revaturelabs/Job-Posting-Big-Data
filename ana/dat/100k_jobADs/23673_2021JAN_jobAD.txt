Because women continued to add jobs in the past month, as of December, women hold more jobs on payrolls than ever. Men have regained 75 percent (4.5 million) of the jobs they lost between December 2007 and the trough for men’s employment in February 2010 (6 million). The gap between women’s and men’s employment is 1.5 million jobs in December, substantially less than at the start of the recession (3.4 million jobs in December 2007).By IWPR|2020-10-31T04:06:05+00:00January 10, 2014|IWPR|Comments Off on Job Growth Slows in December: Women Gained All 74,000 Jobs Added to PayrollsShare This Story, Choose Your Platform!FacebookTwitterRedditLinkedInWhatsAppTumblrPinterestVkEmailRelated Posts	IWPR New Board Social CardsGallery	IWPR New Board Social Cards	As Unemployment Drops, Gains Made by Women in the Workforce Remain Threatened by Historic Job Losses and Lack of ChildcareGallery	As Unemployment Drops, Gains Made by Women in the Workforce Remain Threatened by Historic Job Losses and Lack of Childcare	The Workforce Investment Act and Women’s Progress: Does WIA Funded Training Reinforce Sex Segregation in the Labor Market and the Gender Wage Gap?Gallery	The Workforce Investment Act and Women’s Progress: Does WIA Funded Training Reinforce Sex Segregation in the Labor Market and the Gender Wage Gap?
