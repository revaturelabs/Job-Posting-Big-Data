The ferry company estimates that passenger operations will not recover before the peak season in summer.“Stena Line is therefore forced to take drastic measures to adapt the reduce costs of the new business situation and to secure the continuity of their freight business,” the company pointed out.“Due to the current situation we are facing, we have no choice but to adjust our operations and our costs to limit the drop in demand and secure the continuity of our freight operations,” says Niclas Mårtensson, CEO of Stena Line.Stena Line added it was evaluating its overall operations in all regions due to the sharp decline in travel bookings and does not rule out that there will be further reductions or series of changes to its timetables and/or the route network.FacebookTwitterLinkedinPrevious articleFrontline Wraps Up Acquisition of 10 Suezmaxes from TrafiguraNext articleCMA CGM’s newbuilds feature integral bunker tanksadonisRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORGenco signs the Neptune Declaration on Seafarer Wellbeing and Crew ChangeExploited Indonesian Fishers to be repatriated.
