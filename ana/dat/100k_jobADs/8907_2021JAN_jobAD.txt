Likewise, what if there is no work to go back to? So what is the plan for your future?Do we live in fear for the rest of our lives? I doubt that you would live in fear. The way I see it, people are inherently resilient most of the time.Did you know that most businesses were started during a down economy or during a crisis? I believe that fear of survival drives the entrepreneurial spirit to survive.I am sure that you have noticed that anytime something bad happens in the world the news media tends to drive the fear. their ratings depend on it. So let me ask a question?What if you had to change what you were doing due to an outside influence today?Go Back to Table of ContentsIt suddenly starts to changeNow that I have sparked a thought, That desire to control your circumstances is what drives most entrepreneurs. That passion to make something from nothing. That dream to not punch a clock for someone else.Passion has created many corporations. Desire has made many millionaires and quite a few billionaires. In other words, a lot of success comes from the garage or in your home office. All you have to have is a passion and a desire to change your current situation.Perhaps Reinhold Niebuhr stated it best:“Change is the essence of life; be willing to surrender what you are for what you could become.”Consequently, passion is not about a job or career or even a purpose passion is about excitement. Carmen Gallo defines passion as a positive intense feeling that you experience for something that is profoundly meaningful for you as an individual.What gets you excited to get up and go to work each day? Is it a passion or a chore?Is your life going in the direction you wish to go in? If not, know that you and you alone have the power to change course. Your direction is your decision.That is to say, be your own hero and step into your own boots. Share your passion and your dreams but never let anyone steal your dream.Remember it all starts with your thinking, your vision, and most importantly your actions. your vision, and most importantly your actions.Go Back to Table of ContentsWork from homeSo now that I have hopefully piqued your interest here are several jobs that can be worked from online.

Keep in mind if it were easy everyone would do it. If younotice I have not mentioned anything that is so-called get rich quick. Every business takes time to nurture and grow.With that said, I can tell you that I personally have lost track of how many side hustles I have done in my past. Some were failures and I will say those were the biggest lessons that I learned.See you if learn something from a failure I don’t think it is truly a failure. Very rarely does a first-time business owner succeed in his first attempt.The key to success is to keep moving forward and to have a great accountability partner. As I look back most of my failures was from a lack of support. Im going to leave this right here and you can make of it what you wish.”You can’t connect the dots looking forward you can Only Connect them looking backward you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect your future you have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever, this approach has never let me down and it has made all the difference in my life” – Steve JobsGo Back to Table of ContentsDreams can be RealityYou need to treat your dreams like you treat your children. Dreams like children, don’t raise themselves.Like newborn babies, your dreams, your ideas, your goals, your ambitions, and your visions must be guarded and protected.You wouldn’t leave a young child to sit alone on a park bench and figure life out on its own. So, why would you do the same with your dreams?You need a plan. A plan that ensures that your dreams get fed and your goals get nurtured. With the right amount of parenting any dream even a dream as big as Disneyland can mature into reality.Go Back to Table of ContentsFinal ThoughtsPart-time work online from home can easily turn into a passion and a lucrative income source. Keep in mind the key is multiple streams of income. Passive income is the best way for financial success.Think about it, how many current incomes do you have right now. If you had 4 different income sources if one of them stopped work you could easily move on to another.However, you really can’t do that with you 9-5 job that requires you to show up every day.So my advice is to find a side hustle that interests you and never look back. If it can work for Steve Jobs, it can work for anyone willing to put in the work.Thank you for reading and I hope I was able to leave something for you.
