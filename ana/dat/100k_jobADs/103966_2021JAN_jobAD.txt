Fellows are supported by a T32 training grant funded by the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute on Drug Abuse. The purpose of the training program is to provide research and training opportunities to encourage the development of multidisciplinary skills within or across the above domains as they relate to drug use, addiction, and related psychopathology. There is a particular emphasis on using large-scale neuroimaging and genetic datasets to address questions pertinent to addiction. Fellows have the opportunity to work with any of two dozen distinguished faculty mentors ( listed here ). These mentors are...University of Minnesota University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA PostdocJan 21, 2021Postdoctoral Research Scholar, Cooperation ScienceThe Department of Psychology at Arizona State University invites applications for a Postdoctoral Research Scholar to join the Cooperation Science Network co-directed by Dr. Athena Aktipis (ASU) and Dr. Lee Cronk (Rutgers University). The Postdoctoral Research Scholar will work with an interdisciplinary team to study cooperation across the many domains in which it occurs as part of the newly formed Cooperation Science Network. The goal will be to answer these big questions: (1) What are the similarities and differences among the many manifestations of cooperation across life and humanity? (2) What are the shared principles that drive the emergence of cooperation and make cooperative systems resilient to perturbations? The postdoc will also have the opportunity to help organize events as part of the Cooperation Science Network and ASU’s Interdisciplinary Cooperation Initiative. Applicants with training and expertise in the philosophy of science or a related field are encouraged to...Arizona State University Tempe, AZ, USA PostdocJan 19, 2021Postdoctoral PositionThe Cognitive and Language Development Laboratory at Concordia University in Montreal (https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/research/cognitive-language-development-lab.html) has a postdoctoral position to offer, starting in Summer or Fall 2021. The fellow will be expected to collaborate on research projects on the development of selective trust, theory of mind, bilingualism, and child-robot interactions in infancy and early childhood, with funding from SSHRC and NSERC. The depth of theory of mind in infancy is currently examined with conceptual replications of various paradigms, including violation of expectation, anticipatory looking, interactive, etc. Regarding selective trust, the lab examines developmental changes in the cognitive mechanisms involved in selective social learning. Research paradigms used in the lab include habituation, eye tracking, pupillometry, interactive lab-based tasks and parental reports. International collaborations with teams from US,...Concordia University Montreal, QC, Canada PostdocJan 11, 2021Postdoctoral Research Associate, LGBTQ healthPosition Summary The Department of Psychology at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science invites applications for a full-time Postdoctoral Research Associate position in Dr. Brian Feinstein’s lab. The overarching goals of Dr. Feinstein’s lab are: (1) to advance research on the role of stigma-related stress in the development and maintenance of mental and behavioral health problems among sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations across the lifespan; and (2) to develop and test interventions to improve SGM health. The Postdoctoral Research Associate will contribute to ongoing projects in Dr. Feinstein’s lab (e.g., an NIH-funded pilot trial of an online intervention designed to increase sexual health knowledge and decrease sexual risk behavior among bisexual, pansexual, and queer male youth). They will also contribute to designing and implementing new projects in line with their own and Dr. Feinstein’s research interests.
