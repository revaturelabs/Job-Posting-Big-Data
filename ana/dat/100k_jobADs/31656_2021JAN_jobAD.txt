Fallon spoke toET about Pearson’s global business, investment plans and the future of learning.Edited excerpts:What is driving growth in business globally and in India?Pearson is about £4 billion in annual sales. The fastest growing areas are professional certifications (through Pearson Vue). A fast growing business in America is virtual schools, for K-12 age students. We’re seeing if this can be scaled (up). Partnerships with universities to provide purely online degree programs are fast-growing — this will continue to grow strongly. In India, English has also been a big growth opportunity, especially the Pearson English Test. Partnerships with companies for reskilling employees are also a growing business. We’re expecting revenues to at least stabilise this year. About 40% of our revenues come from the structural growth markets, which I mentioned earlier. This is growing in the high single digits. The other 60% comes from course ware and assessments, particularly the US college publishing market, where it has been declining, although the pace of the slowdown has been decreasing. As the business shifts towards digital, we’re expecting to see faster growth. We reach 100 million learners a year, and the aim is to increase that number exponentially.Has there been any impact of the economic slowdown on the business?Not that we’ve seen. Education is counter-cyclical. When jobs are hard to come by, people realise the value of education.Read More Offshore, sub-contractors, subsidiaries to drive margins back: Tech Mahindra CEOIn India, we reach 10 million learners, and the business has been growing at 20% year-on-year.if(geolocation && geolocation != 5 && (typeof skip == 'undefined' || typeof skip.fbevents == 'undefined')) { !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s) {if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod? n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)}; if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0'; n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0; t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script', 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js'); fbq('init', '338698809636220'); fbq('track', 'PageView'); }READ SOURCEShare this:TwitterFacebooktweetShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on LinkedInShare on Redditbusinesstelegraph September 10, 2019previous articleRestoring land for livelihoods, climate and economynext articleRenault gearing up to launch Kwid as an electric vehicle in 2022 – here are the specsLeave a Reply Cancel replyWrite your comment hereNameEmailNotify me of follow-up comments by email.Notify me of new posts by email.You Might Also LikeOpinionsCan Tesla sway the price-conscious Indian?January 22, 2021OpinionsBuy or Sell: Stock ideas by experts for January 22, 2021January 22, 2021OpinionsSensex hits 50K: Here's what market experts say on what's nextJanuary 21, 2021OpinionsDo you think the protesting farmers are being too rigid in their stand?January 21, 2021OpinionsTop investment ideas for today's record-high market performanceJanuary 21, 2021OpinionsKeep faith in the India story, don't go by tips: Madhu KelaJanuary 21, 2021Latest NewsCoronavirus live news: Hong Kong orders partial lockdown; UK variant concerns mountIceland is selling “takeaway” burgers that look just like McDonald’s Big MacsOne of the best Kindle features was also a security disaster waiting to happen – TechRadarNevis Robotics Team is rebuilding – Park Rapids EnterpriseAn early bitcoin investor says the best time to buy is when nobody's talking about it – and warns this is.. – Markets InsiderFocos for iPhone gets ProRAW support – iMoreThe Benefits of Financial Security – TechBullionBlackRock’s sustainability ‘report card’ one year from Fink’s annual letterGreen homes: how to shut out the winter cold and save cashAzim Premji University, FICCI, TISS roll out plan for employment generation in MSME sector‘They were freaking out’: meet the people treating NHS workers for traumaCommentary: How Biden can rebuild trust in our elections – Kennebec Journal & Morning SentinelHow to stay safe with a fast-spreading new coronavirus variant on the looseElectric cars will kill off changing gear, so should you ditch manual driving?Eurozone warning: EU rules would be 'disaster' for the UK, warns economistTwo senior executives quit Trifecta CapitalThinking of switching from WhatsApp to Signal?
