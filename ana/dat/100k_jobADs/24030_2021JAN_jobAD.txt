We bring security, efficiency and joy to a paper-based pillar of the US economy.The type of problems we focus on involve workflow, product design, and data. Monolith vs microservice is an ongoing debate. We are working to find a good authentication pattern that allows for people to work across companies in multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think!).

Weâ€™re becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and now weâ€™re looking to hire another core engineer to help us scale our platform.As a Software Engineer you will play a central role in building a quality digital closing platform that our partners can trust and use.

Your day to day interactions span product and engineering teams to release at a high velocity in all phases of the SDLC. We have a small team so your contributions will have huge impact.Here is where you come in. Upon completing your BS/BA Computer Science, you joined the industry ready to contribute to a growing business. Now itâ€™s time to dive into the startup world and apply your talents to solve real world problems. Over the past 4+ years you have mastered object-oriented programming with at least one of these Ruby, Go, Python, Scala, Java etc working in a production environment. More recently you have been focused on backend development, building APIs, services & working with relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc). You have a bias for testing and quality is at the center of your work. Cross functional collaboration is important to you as you are eager to solve a range of problems across the org. Today our team is working in Ruby on Rails, React, Postgres, AWS, Docker, & Kubernetes to name a few but things change quickly so be comfortable learning new tools.
