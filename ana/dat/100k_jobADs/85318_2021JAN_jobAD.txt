"Louisiana casinos, gaming industry lost revenue, jobs November 2020William Taylor PotterLafayette Daily AdvertiserLouisiana's gaming industry likely lost more than $830 million in 2020, and at least 4,790 employees were laid off at some point during the year, according to data from the Louisiana Workforce Commission and the Louisiana Gaming Control Board.Through November, Louisiana's video gaming, racetrack slot machines, land-based casinos and riverboat casinos combined to lose more than $829.7 million in revenue compared to the same period in 2019. The Louisiana Gaming Control Board's revenue reports do not include all casinos, such as Indian casinos.Video gaming machines stationed at bars, restaurants, hotels, racetracks and truck stops have seen revenue fall by about $76.5 million through November — a 13.2% loss from the same period in 2019.The state's lone land-based, non-Indian casino, Harrah's in New Orleans, saw revenue fall $137.2 million or by more than half compared to last year. The casino posted no revenue in April or May due to state and local COVID-19 restrictions, costing the business nearly $50 million in those two months alone.Riverboat casinos lost around $525.7 million in revenue or about 31.6% on the year. The losses were most extreme in the Lake Charles area, where its three casinos combined to lose nearly $218.7 million. The region was hit hard by both COVID-19 restrictions and Hurricanes Laura and Delta, which prevented the casinos from seeing the slight recovery other regions saw.With the exception of Harrah's in New Orleans, L'Auberge Lake Charles and the Golden Nugget Lake Charles had the two largest declines in revenue in 2020. L'Auberge Lake Charles lost around $92.9 million, and the Golden Nugget lost $77.8 million.The Shreveport region's casinos were also hit hard, losing $179.1 million between six properties: Boomtown Bossier City, Eldorado Resort, Horseshoe Bossier City, DiamondJacks Casino, Sam's Town and Margaritaville. In May, DiamondJacks announced it would be permanently closing as a result of COVID-19.Slot machines at racetracks lost around $98.2 million or 30.5% of revenue through November.It's possible that the state's gaming industry ends the year more than $1 billion down from 2019. Casino revenues have dipped in recent months after slight recoveries in the summer, and overall gaming revenues were down about $51.5 million in November — the biggest shortfall since August.If the industry sees revenues similar to May, when it lost just under $178 million, it could surpass $1 billion in losses. It's unlikely, however, because the state's restrictions were more severe back in May.Mass layoffs also plagued the state's casinos in 2020, with the businesses filing Wage Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices covering nearly 5,000 casino workers over the course of the year.Fourteen different casinos filed WARN notices in 2020. The WARN Act requires businesses report layoffs to the state when they exceed a certain number of employees or a certain percentage of a business's total employee count, so some casino layoffs may not have required a WARN notice.Harrah’s Louisiana Downs, a racetrack in Bossier City, informed the state that 201 workers would be laid off at the end of March 2020. Horseshoe, also in Bossier City, laid off 978 workers at the same time. The now-closed DiamondJacks in Bossier City laid off 349 workers on May 22.A slew of WARN notices were filed May 22 for five different casinos for layoffs beginning July 1. Sam’s Town in Shreveport laid off 414 workers, Treasure Chest Casino in Kenner laid off 340 employees. Amelia Belle Casino in Amelia laid off 170 workers.Delta Downs Racetrack Casino and Hotel in Vinton laid off 354 employees. Evangeline Downs Racetrack Casino in Opelousas laid off 246 workers.In the middle of June, several more casinos filed WARN notices for layoffs effective Aug. 15. Boomtown New Orleans in Harvey laid off 197 workers, while Margaritaville in Bossier City laid off 347. L’Auberge Casino in Baton Rouge laid off 162 employees. L’Auberge Casino Resort in Lake Charles laid off 441 workers.Cypress Bayou Casino Hotel in Charenton filed a WARN notice for 229 employees effective July 1. Boomtown New Orleans laid off another 28 workers Sept. 15, and Isle of Capri Casino in Westlake is planning to lay off 336 employees at the beginning of February 2021.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2021 www.theadvertiser.com.
