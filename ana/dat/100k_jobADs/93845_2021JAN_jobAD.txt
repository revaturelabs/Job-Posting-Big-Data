You can enrol for the JobKeeper payments at any time until the program closes. Visit the Autsralian Taxation Office's website.IS JOBKEEPER SUBJECT TO PAYROLL TAX?For employers who are accepting JobKeeper payments these payments are exempt from payroll tax.This applies to the full $1500 fortnightly payment per eligible employee.WHAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS WITH JOBKEEPER?Some part-time workers and casuals received an increase in income due to the flat rate payment and the incentive to work additional hours was impacted.WHAT CHANGES ARE BEING MADE TO JOBSEEKER?JobSeeker - previously known as the Newstart allowance - had its payment doubled to about $1100 a fortnight in March and there was also the introduction of an additional coronavirus supplement.From September 25 the supplement will fall to $250 a fortnight, which means the total JobSeeker payment will be about $800 per fortnight.These arrangements will stay in place until the end of December.WHAT ARE THE EXACT JOBSEEKER PAYMENTS?Under existing arrangements single recipients are entitled to $1115.70 per fortnight.This includes $565.70 JobSeeker payment and the $550 coronavirus supplement.These amounts vary depending on a person's situation.This will then drop at the end of the month to $815 a fortnight when the coronavirus supplement is reduced by $300 per fortnight.WHAT IS THE CORONAVIRUS SUPPLEMENT?It's a fortnightly payment of $550 if you get an eligible income support payment and is taxable income.This is automatically given to people on income support including Jobseeker payments, youth allowance, Austudy and ABSTUDY until September 24 before it is wound back to $250 per fortnight.From last month JobSeeker recipients must connect with employment services and undertake four job searches a month.There will be penalties if they refuse a job.WHO WILL CONTINUE TO GET THE CORONAVIRUS SUPPLEMENT?Both existing and new income support recipients will continue to receive the temporary coronavirus supplements while the economy recovers through until December 31.sophie.elsworth@news.com.au@sophieelsworthOriginally published as What JobKeeper, JobSeeker changes mean for youMore StoriesPremium Content The faces of Queensland’s border closurePremium Content Flight credit, points at risk as Virgin D-day nearsPremium Content Lock your doors: COVID crime wave fearsPremium Content Qld companies claiming hundreds of millions in JobkeekerPremium Content No smiles behind shocking claims made in parliament‘Worst ever’: Dire cost of COVID revealedShow MoreMore StoriesPremium Content The faces of Queensland’s border closurePremium Content Flight credit, points at risk as Virgin D-day nearsPremium Content Lock your doors: COVID crime wave fearsPremium Content Qld companies claiming hundreds of millions in JobkeekerPremium Content No smiles behind shocking claims made in parliament‘Worst ever’: Dire cost of COVID revealedShow More0changesRead MoreLogin to followcoronavirusRead MoreLogin to followcovid-19Read MoreLogin to followeditors picksRead MoreLogin to followjobkeeperRead MoreLogin to followjobseekerRead MoreLogin to followpaymentsRead MoreLogin to followchanges coronavirus covid-19 editors picks jobkeeper jobseeker paymentsSubscriber ExclusivesPremium Content Trucking industry mourning the loss of road safety advocateNews The Australian trucking industry is today mourning the loss of renowned operator Jim Pearson SeniorPremium Content Aged care worker shortage brings nurse out of retirementHealth An increase in demand for aged care registered nurses has given a Grafton woman a perfect opportunity to return to the workforcePremium Content SOCIALS: Out and about at the Yamba Street Food FestivalPeople and Places See who was enjoying a glorious day on the greens at Yamba Golf and Country Club this afternoonPremium Content Mother pleads guilty to drink-driving prior to horror crashNews Woman accused of negligent driving in Dundurrabin crash which left daughter critical was caught drink-driving in weeks prior.Premium Content AHOY THERE!
