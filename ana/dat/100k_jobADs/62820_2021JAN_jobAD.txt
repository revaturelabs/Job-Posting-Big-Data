Whatever it can’t raise through the bond it aims to borrow through commercial lending. So far, fans have committed nearly £1.8m to the bond.Earthworks for the 9,000-capacity stadium, which the club hopes eventually to be able to expand to 20,000 by connecting all four corners between stands, began in May 2019. In July 2019, the club predicted that the overall cost of the project would be £30m. The main west stand will have four tiers, media facilities, and 12 executive boxes as well as additional facilities but the club warned late last year that if it built only what it could afford, the stand would just be a “basic shell”.Latest articles in News‘W-shaped’ recovery predicted for constructionGrenfell Tower Inquiry to resume on 8 FebruaryHousing associations team up to build 9,000 offsite homes a yearSuspended sentence for construction boss after crush accidentVideo | Demolition firm cranes 1939 passenger ship ashoreNewsletterSubscriptionsAdvertise with usRSS FeedsTerms & ConditionsContact UsPrivacy policy© Atom 2021"
