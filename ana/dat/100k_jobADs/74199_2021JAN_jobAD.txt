Tagged: job-hunting, my life, politics, random musings.	71 CommentsRenxkyoko Iglesias here. Hi !I didn’t watch the second debate. While watching the first debate, I did a juvenile thing …. I threw potato chips at the TV, not to mention my intestines almost exploded. Eh. I don’t need that kind of aggravation in my life.So, okay, some of my readers have been asking me about my job hunting. Thank you very much for asking. I did say on my previous post my dream job was to be a forensics analyst….. after all, that’s one of my majors ( I graduated with 2 majors, Cell and Molecular Biology , Minor in Chemistry, and Forensics Biology. ) I applied as Criminalist 1 two months ago, took a test,…… unfortunately, it was an ” experience ” test with questions like ” Have you ever been called as a DNA expert at a court trial ? ” What the heck ! Of course I haven’t. So, I didn’t get the job. But I have a question…… I got a Rank 4 and they said they took in those that got Ranks 1 , 2 and 3 ( with experience , all of them ) but I’d have first priority if and when a position opens within the next 2 years. I told my police officer friend about it….. and she said, ” Congratulations , girl, Rank 4 is great news. Just be patient. ” My question is, what does getting a Rank 4 really mean ? I want to be optimistic . That’s my dream job, after all.Good thing I have another degree to fall back on. I actually got so many responses to my applications, but 90% of them are from out of my city…….. LA, Nevada, San Francisco, Berkeley, etc. Oh, wait, I even applied at NSA ( National Security Agency , ha ha ha ) I answered NO to all the questions, except the one on being bi-lingual. Then the questions got more detailed. Well, never mind. Hey, that’s NSA , okay ? * zips mouth *I got 2 responses from 2 companies that are located in my city…. one from Diagnostics and one from a dairy company. At Diagnostics, I didn’t get the job because , believe it or not, I WAS OVERQUALIFIED in the position that I applied for. That’s one heck of a reason for rejecting me.Well, good news! ! ! I got the job at a dairy company. I am now working at their Quality Control department, checking out for contaminants, microbes…. in other words, the quality of the finished products, duh. The dairy company manufactures milk, of course, and ice cream, novelty ice cream products, cheese, cream cheese, gosh,even eggnog, and any product that comes from milk. Our milk comes from California cows, and California cows are happy cows.My work schedule is fluid… sometimes it is from 12 PM to 8:30 PM….. or 8 PM to 4:30 AM . Another good thing about this job is , it’s a) unionized b) pay is good, very, very good c) it’s just an 11 to 12 minute drive from our house.Irrelevant random photos because there should be photos, right ? I love these ones that I took at Louvre Palace in Paris. Bet you haven’t seen a photo of Venus de Milo’s butt.This is all for now. Thanks for reading, folks ! !Please check out my anime/manga website here at http://2megaworthitwordpresscomblog.wordpress.com/Share this:TwitterLike this:Like Loading...Related71 responses to this post.Posted by Cassidy Frazee on October 10, 2016 at 10:42 amIf you’d gotten the job at the NSA you’d be only 90 minutes from me. We could have hung out!So if we get sick from your happy cow’s milk, we know who to blame. 🙂ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 10, 2016 at 11:01 amOh, D.C. is just 90 minutes from you ?I know, right ? The place is very sanitized. I was given a $120 work shoes. We’re not supposed to wear outside shoes at the workplace. I assure you, you’ll get good milk from our happy cows. I’ll work hard.ReplyPosted by Cassidy Frazee on October 10, 2016 at 11:12 amD.C. is two hours away, but Fort Meade is just over 90. I have a friend who works for the NSA and I’ve visited her a few times down there.Are the cows in CA happy because they get health care from the state? 😉ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 10, 2016 at 11:36 amThe cows do ! ! They are accessorized, as well. Cowbells, y’know ? And the chickens, too. California is very strict on care of chickens.ReplyPosted by Cassidy Frazee on October 10, 2016 at 11:36 amIt sounds like they would be.ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 10, 2016 at 5:20 pmWell, yeah, the hippies demand it. He hePosted by vinnieh on October 10, 2016 at 10:46 amI’d love to go to the Louvre.ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 10, 2016 at 11:40 amAmazing place ! !ReplyPosted by vinnieh on October 10, 2016 at 11:41 amLove the photo you had.ReplyPosted by arlene on October 10, 2016 at 11:11 amCongrats on the new job Ren 🙂ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 10, 2016 at 11:41 amThanks, Ma’m Arlene ! !ReplyPosted by J. White Sensei on October 17, 2016 at 1:17 amCongrats. Been a long time 😉ReplyPosted by pseudomonaz on October 10, 2016 at 1:14 pmCongratulations on the job… 🙂 and all the best for your dream job. I have a masters in biotechnology… It’s hard getting a job here in India with biotech. I have actually changed my field.. After doing a master I am now trying for administrative jobs which is equally very hard. Life in twenties suck… 😦ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 10, 2016 at 3:19 pmBoom ! That’s exactly the reason why I labored so much for 2 degrees. I mean, how many Forensics Analyst jobs are there in one city ? One ! * sigh *ReplyPosted by Jim on October 10, 2016 at 1:21 pmbet you’re wrong about me not seeing the Venus butt. 😉ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 10, 2016 at 5:33 pmI lose the bet ? Ha ha !ReplyPosted by Ashik T M on October 10, 2016 at 3:39 pmCongrats on your new job☺ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 10, 2016 at 5:33 pmHey, thanks and cheers !ReplyPosted by sraddhavakkalagadda on October 10, 2016 at 4:54 pmCongrats. 😊🎉 Here’s hoping someone in the first three ranks leaves and you get the job. Anyway good luck with this one. 😊ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 10, 2016 at 7:34 pmUgh. there are actually 5 positions…. Criminalist 1,2,3 ,4, and 5. I applied for the entry level. Well, I hope they get promoted to upper level positions, and leave their position vacant for me to fill up. * taps on wood *ReplyPosted by Rocco B on October 10, 2016 at 5:41 pmCongrats Ren!!! :D. Hey there is an anime you can check out since forensics is one of your specialised area. It’s called beautiful bones; a corpse beneath Sakurako’ feet. It’s about Sakurako, who is a osteologist but doubles up as other forensics specialist. She is also like a dectective. It’s a light mystery, so you could check it out.ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 10, 2016 at 7:31 pmI think we call that specialty Forensics paleontology ? I’m been wanting to watch that, but I don’t get to see that on Hulu. I always miss it everytime I check the list.At first I thought she was just a weird girl, so I wasn’t really that keen on watching it.ReplyPosted by readinpleasure on October 10, 2016 at 5:43 pmCongratulations on your new job. Great. 🙂ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 10, 2016 at 7:27 pmThank you very much, readinpleasure !ReplyPosted by disperser on October 10, 2016 at 10:04 pmCongratulations, especially on the good pay. That’s always nice.ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 11, 2016 at 6:27 pmThe pay is really good. I was surprised myself. I didn’t expect a newbie to get that much.ReplyPosted by Xena on October 11, 2016 at 10:00 ami am so very happy to hear that you landed a job. When you said “quality control” I thought about pharmaceutical companies. A diary company might be more fun. 🙂 Congratulations!ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 11, 2016 at 10:53 amMy sister is working for a pharmaceutical company, ha ha haReplyPosted by Mick Canning on October 11, 2016 at 12:09 pmCongrats on the job!ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 11, 2016 at 6:28 pmThank you , Mick Canning !ReplyPosted by Paul Stroessner on October 11, 2016 at 5:35 pmCongratulations on landing the job! I hope you enjoy it. But, I also hope that you are able to become a Criminalist because it sounds like that’s what you want to do.I still haven’t been back to the Venus DeMilo restaurant near me. I don’t know if you remember, but when you originally posted those pictures, I told you about that restaurant, and how they have a replica of the statue. I still promise that I’ll get a picture of her butt. 😀ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 11, 2016 at 6:38 pmI know. T.T Yes, that’s what I want to do. I like crime stories, and to work as a Criminalist is practically living in that world. It’s a bit dark, but the work will help to make the world a better, safer place. It would be a dilemma if they suddenly called me for an interview in one year, and I’d be forced to leave my present job that I also like.ha ha I remember that, and also, that it was you ! Is the statue still there ?ReplyPosted by Paul Stroessner on October 11, 2016 at 6:44 pmOh I’m sure. It’s been there since I was a child. Maybe even before I was born. Alot of people have weddings there, but I haven’t been to any weddings around here in years.ReplyPosted by Jay on October 12, 2016 at 2:17 pmGlad to hear you’re doing such a good job.ReplyPosted by imagesbytdashfield on October 12, 2016 at 6:51 pmCongrats on the new job!ReplyPosted by historypresent on October 12, 2016 at 7:14 pmCongratulations!ReplyPosted by Poet Rummager on October 13, 2016 at 11:58 amCongratulations! Now, everyone will be asking you: “Got milk?”ReplyPosted by Tikeetha T on October 13, 2016 at 6:17 pmCongratulations on your new job!ReplyPosted by faydelmix1979@mylittlesimplethought on October 14, 2016 at 5:50 amcongrats on your new job.I like the job because i work in as a process-quality control technician in a company here in NIGERIA.Above all,the simplicity of your write up is quite good.ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 14, 2016 at 7:44 amI’m starting to like it, as well….ReplyPosted by faydelmix1979@mylittlesimplethought on October 14, 2016 at 7:51 amgradually,you will develop more affinity for your new job,at least you are entitled to volumes of fresh milk….ReplyPosted by shalzmojo on October 14, 2016 at 7:11 amI drool over Venus DiMilo and couldnt get enough of it at the Louvre – wish I could have stayed there – thanks for sharing the pics.I loved your job musings- the predicaments were original and funny.Glad you have a well paying job thats keeping you happy and busy.Hang in there, Rank4 is amazing and I am sure you are going to get that call soon.ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 14, 2016 at 7:49 amThanks !I hope they don’t call me in one year. I don’t want to quit this job. I don’t want them to think this is just a filler. * sigh *ReplyPosted by Amy on October 14, 2016 at 1:39 pmCongratulations! How cool!! 🙂Thank you for sharing the great news with us.ReplyPosted by Debbrah Maxwell on October 14, 2016 at 4:05 pmYou got nominated.http://www.debbrahmaxwell.wordpress.comReplyPosted by The Otaku Judge on October 14, 2016 at 7:02 pmCongrats on the job. Sounds more fun than spying on your readers for the NSA 🙂 Do you get free ice cream?ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 16, 2016 at 1:54 pmThanks, Otaku Judge.We get samples from different batches in one day. We’re suppose to throw them away. And we do.ReplyPosted by mistermuse on October 15, 2016 at 11:10 amNaturally your “work schedule is fluid” — you’re working with milk and “any product that comes from milk.” 🙂 Congrats on the job!P.S. I love your wit (you did choose the word “fluid” on purpose, right?)ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 16, 2016 at 1:11 pmLOL Oh my gosh, yes ! I used it on purpose ! You got it !! ( Although I didn’t expect anyone to notice it… it wasn’t even a pun, ha ha )ReplyPosted by mistermuse on October 28, 2016 at 10:45 am….even so, it was certainly a “fluid” situation. 🙂ReplyPosted by bagotilyo on October 15, 2016 at 12:06 pmNothing more to say than congratulations. Make your job meaningful 🙂ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 17, 2016 at 2:55 pmThanks , bagotilyo. It’s been awhile, huh. How ‘s life coming along, my friend ?ReplyPosted by bagotilyo on October 23, 2016 at 3:43 amYeah, it’s been a while. Can’t remember when was the last time we exchanged comments . haha. Take care my friend 🙂ReplyPosted by El Coleccionista Hipnótico on October 17, 2016 at 11:40 amLoved this post. Thanks a lot for these interesting funny words you wrote. The Venus de Milo’s photos really made it even greater. Have a nice weekReplyPosted by aysabaw on October 17, 2016 at 1:50 pmsurely Ren you are overqualified he he he heReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 17, 2016 at 2:45 pmGirl, I’ll holler for a dollar. ~( ^_^ ~) (~ ^_^)~ReplyPosted by aysabaw on October 17, 2016 at 2:49 pmHihihihiReplyPosted by Don on October 17, 2016 at 4:16 pmI’m sure with your qualifications the right job will come. No doubt about it. By the way, I also felt like throwing chips at the TV.ReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 17, 2016 at 5:26 pmThe whole world is watching. It’s amazing that almost 1/2 of Americans support this guy. Incomprehensible. I don’t care about his politics, each to his her own, but an unhinge , dangerous guy with his finger on the button should not be allowed into the White House.ReplyPosted by Don on October 17, 2016 at 6:22 pmI agree.ReplyPosted by barkinginthedark on October 18, 2016 at 5:02 pmoooh…ice cream. congrats. continue…ReplyPosted by A. Blake on October 19, 2016 at 3:22 pmuh oh…watch out tv tonight!!! The 3rd and final debate – my heart, head and stomach can’t take it!ReplyPosted by Ste J on October 20, 2016 at 8:53 amCongratulations on getting a job that is sure to be a conversations starter at parties. Night shifts aren’t half bad when you get into them, as a reader I ddin’t have much of a social life anyway, ha!ReplyPosted by JunkChuck on October 22, 2016 at 3:49 pmCongratulations on the new job. You were smart to skip the debate–it was was worst of the three. Thanks for stopping by my blog the other day–yours was one of the first I started following when I joined WP years ago, though I just noticed that while I was away from the WP scene a bunch of my “follows” disappeared and I had to re-follow. Odd. But anyway, nice to be back and see things are going well for you.ReplyPosted by p2d2 on October 23, 2016 at 5:35 amCongrats on bagging a decent job, especially with your vast educational experience. It seems as though OVERQUALIFIED is the new UNDERQUALIFIED. I’ve only got a BS in Criminal Justice (AKA pseudo-behavioral science) and I work law enforcement that isn’t worth the money and hassle. (Don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful and all!)My wife has her masters in historical architecture and BS in Education and makes 23K at private school teaching. (there are some perks but nothing in comparison to what she should be making)It truly baffles me when it comes to jobs and whose doing the hiring at these places. It makes me think that there is little or no real oversight in who or how they hire.ReplyPosted by Martian on October 24, 2016 at 3:58 pmGood luck to youReplyPosted by renxkyoko on October 24, 2016 at 4:54 pmThank you !ReplyPosted by Rebecca Dawn on October 25, 2016 at 5:25 amCongratulations! I really scratched my head at how anyone can be overqualified for a job! If a company puts out an ad for a position and someone is qualified to do it, hire them! Especially with this kind of economy.I’m also thinking of all the cute cows you get to look at 😄I love cows. Could do without chickens 😕🐄🐄🐄ReplyPosted by D K Powell on October 27, 2016 at 6:37 pmCongrats on the job! I hope it all goes well for you 🙂ReplyPosted by Simply-Me on October 28, 2016 at 4:14 amCongratulations on getting a new job.ReplyPosted by evan on October 30, 2016 at 4:05 pmCongrats and All the best to your new job!ReplyLeave a Reply to renxkyoko Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
