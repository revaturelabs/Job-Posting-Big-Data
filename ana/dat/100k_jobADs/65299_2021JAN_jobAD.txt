Rural areas and teaching hospitals are especially in desperate need of these nurses. Upstate South Carolina is doing well keeping nursing vacancy rates low for now, but that is expected to change. This is because like the majority of states, South Carolina has an aging population and a shortage of nurse educators. The state is being proactive, though, knowing that a nursing shortage is inevitable.AndersonCharlestonColumbiaConwayFlorenceGreenvilleHilton Head IslandLexingtonMount PleasantMyrtle BeachNorth CharlestonRock HillRockinghamSpartanburgSumterSouth Carolina Travel Nurse Jobs By City |Addictions NursingAmbulatory Care NursingCardiac Catheterization Lab NursingCardiac NursingCase ManagementCertified Nurse MidwifeCNACertified Nursing AssistantClinical Nurse SpecialistCritical Care NursingDiabetes Management NursingEducator/InstructorEmergency NursingEmergency-Trauma NursingFlight-Transport NursingForensic NursingGastroenterology NursingGeriatric NursingHIV/AIDS NursingHolistic NursingHome Health AideHome Healthcare NursingInfectious Disease NursingInfusion Therapy NursingIntellectual & Developmental Disabilities NursingIntravenous Therapy NursingLabor-Delivery NursingLegal Nursing ConsultantLPNLVNMedical AssistantsMedical-Surgical NursingNeonatal Nursing (NICU)Nephrology NursingNeuro-Surgical NursingNurse AnesthetistNurse PractitionerNursing AssistantNursing InformaticsOB-GYN NursingOccupational Health NursingOncology NursingOperating Room/Surgical NursingOrthopedic NursingParish NursingPC TechPCAPediatric Nurse PractitionerPediatric Nursing (PICU)PeriAnesthesia NursingPerioperative NursingPhysical TherapistPsychiatric NursingPublic HealthRadiology NursingRNRegistered Nurse ConsultantRehabilitation NursingRenal-Dialysis NursingSchool NursingTelemetry NursingTransplant NursingUrology NursingWound, Ostomy and Continence NursingGenetics NursingHospice and Palliative Care NursingSouth Carolina Travel Nurse Jobs By Job Function |20 mile radius | 50 mile radius | 100 mile radius	jobs byTravel Nurse Jobs by TitleTravel Nurse Jobs by LocationCompanyPostedInpatient Rehab Registered Nurse Associate's Degree in Nursing or higher is required.
