It was a cattle drive!Yehoshua Paul 23 Mar 2012 ReplyI had an interview for a job that I was clearly underqualified for. The guy who originally invited me in hadnâ€™t really looked at my resume. an hour before my job interview the guy reviews my CV, and is so annoyed that he is forced to waste his time on me that he spends the entire interview going through my resume bullet by bullet, and explaining to me how it is both badly written, and demonstrates how unsuitable I am for the job. The interviewer was a jackass, and I remember that interview to this day by always telling people to avoid his company.Chris Parker 23 Mar 2012 ReplyMy most memorable interview was one that lasted 3 hours. There was the first interview, then the assessment interview, then finished with the last part of the interview. It was with three interviewers.Kate 25 Mar 2012 ReplyI was in university on my way to a summer job interview when I got caught in a sudden summer rain shower. I arrived at the interview completely drenched and, because I cooled off so quickly in the air conditioning, I started shaking and shivering. Then, because I was so nervous about looking dreched, shaking and shivering, I started to sweat uncontrollably. I was such a mess, the interviewers took pity on my and called a few days later to offer my another chance.Laurie Tamres 25 Mar 2012 ReplyI had an interview for an internship. I was living in Israel. I got off the bus in the pouring rain at the wrong stop. Walked over 3 miles in the rain. Got to the place, the owners took my clothes (and of course gave me something to wear), washed and dried them, fed me, gave me hot tea, and gave me the JOB. Sometimes the effort is all it takes.Pingback: #CONTEST: Leave a Comment, Win Help For Your Google Rankings | JobMobPingback: Winners of the JobMob 5th Birthday Week Contests | JobMobJacob Share 27 Mar 2012 ReplyThank you all for the great comments.Did you win?
