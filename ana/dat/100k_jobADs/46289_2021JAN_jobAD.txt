Greenwood & Associates | Apr 14, 2020 | DivorceNo one wants to find him or herself in the position of unemployment. Unfortunately, many Utah residents have little control over whether they face layoffs at work or otherwise lose their job due to circumstances beyond their control. Of course, many financial obligations do not pause because of unemployment, and that includes child support.If a parent who pays child support loses his or her job, it is not an option to simply stop making those payments. If this does happen, that parent could face serious repercussions for failure to pay. In some cases, that could mean a parent facing jail time for failing to comply with a court order. Even if a parent does not face this sentence, he or she would still be obligated to make up any missed payment, which could come with fines and other penalties.It may be possible for some parents to obtain unemployment pay, some of which could go toward support payments, but not every parent gets this benefit. If ineligible, parents may want to contact the family law court about their situation. If parents continue to look for a new job and can provide documentation of the job search, the court may show them some leniency.Because circumstances can change, Utah parents may want to keep in mind that they could seek modifications of their child support order. In cases of job loss, presenting a case to the court as to why the payment amount should be lowered or suspended temporarily may be necessary. In order to gain more information on this type of scenario, concerned parties may want to speak with experienced family law attorneys.FacebookTwitterLinkedInSearch for:CategoriesBankruptcy (4)Child Custody (9)Criminal Law (7)Divorce (305)DUI (158)Family Law (17)High Asset Divorce (8)Motor Vehicle Accidents (5)Personal Injury (11)ArchivesJanuary 2021 (1)December 2020 (6)November 2020 (3)October 2020 (4)September 2020 (5)August 2020 (6)July 2020 (5)June 2020 (6)May 2020 (5)April 2020 (5)March 2020 (6)February 2020 (5)January 2020 (5)December 2019 (6)November 2019 (5)October 2019 (6)September 2019 (5)August 2019 (5)July 2019 (7)June 2019 (5)May 2019 (6)April 2019 (5)March 2019 (5)February 2019 (5)January 2019 (6)December 2018 (5)November 2018 (5)October 2018 (6)September 2018 (5)August 2018 (5)July 2018 (6)June 2018 (6)May 2018 (5)April 2018 (5)March 2018 (6)February 2018 (5)January 2018 (5)December 2017 (5)November 2017 (6)October 2017 (5)September 2017 (5)August 2017 (6)July 2017 (5)June 2017 (6)May 2017 (7)April 2017 (5)March 2017 (7)February 2017 (4)January 2017 (6)December 2016 (4)November 2016 (5)October 2016 (4)September 2016 (5)August 2016 (4)July 2016 (4)June 2016 (5)May 2016 (4)April 2016 (5)March 2016 (4)February 2016 (4)January 2016 (5)December 2015 (4)November 2015 (4)October 2015 (4)September 2015 (5)August 2015 (4)July 2015 (5)June 2015 (4)May 2015 (4)April 2015 (5)March 2015 (4)February 2015 (4)January 2015 (4)December 2014 (5)November 2014 (4)October 2014 (5)September 2014 (4)August 2014 (5)July 2014 (4)June 2014 (4)May 2014 (5)April 2014 (4)March 2014 (4)February 2014 (4)January 2014 (5)December 2013 (4)November 2013 (4)October 2013 (4)September 2013 (5)August 2013 (4)July 2013 (5)June 2013 (5)May 2013 (4)April 2013 (4)March 2013 (3)February 2013 (5)January 2013 (5)December 2012 (4)November 2012 (5)October 2012 (3)September 2012 (4)August 2012 (3)July 2012 (5)June 2012 (5)February 2012 (1)January 2012 (3)December 2011 (2)November 2011 (5)October 2011 (4)September 2011 (7)August 2011 (3)Recent PostsThree financial considerations for high-asset divorceesWhat happens to the family business when owners divorce?How to keep separate property separate in a divorceModifying child supportMediation is not always the best way to divorceSubscribe To This Blog’s FeedTestimonialsI can’t speak highly enough of Kris and his team.
