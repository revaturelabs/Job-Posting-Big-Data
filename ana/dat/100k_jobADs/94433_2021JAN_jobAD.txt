Zimbabwe was somewhat more of the same, but with large supermarkets and even a dedicated bottle shop in Victoria Falls(!) finding the local brews was easier than ever. Unfortunately they still drank Shake-Shake here, however they had a different delivery method which managed to put me off it even more…Continue reading →Posted from Victoria Falls, Matabeleland North, Zimbabwe.Beer, Chibuku, Lager, Pilsener, Scud, Zambezi	2 Comments5Feb2015Beer Review: ZambiaPosted in Africa, Food & Drink, Zambia	by Leckie	As soon as we had stepped over the border from Malawi into Zambia, the hunt for a drinkable beer was on. After being permanently scarred by Malawi’s Shake Shake, there had to be something better here. Whilst we didn’t have a long time in Zambia, we did manage to try the nation’s two most popular beers.

We drank A LOT of beer in Tanzania, especially on the beaches of Zanzibar. I almost feel overqualified for this review thinking back on it. The fact that we spent a couple of weeks in a beautiful, sunny, island paradise made them go down easy, and the fact they were cheap every night during the 2014 World Cup games certainly didn’t stop them flowing.Continue reading →Posted from Nungwi, Zanzibar North, Tanzania.Africa, Beer, Kilimanjaro, Safari, Serengeti	Leave a comment18Jun2014Beer Review: RwandaPosted in Food & Drink, Rwanda	by Leckie	Rwanda is not a country many people know too much about. Infamous world wide for it’s somewhat recent genocide, and famous as home to some of the last wild mountain gorillas on Earth. Most couldn’t tell you much more, but as always I had one burning question… “What kind of beer do they drink?” Armed with a fistful of Francs and a thirst, I decided to find out.Continue reading →Africa, Beer	Leave a commentPost navigation« Older postsFollow Us!Subscribe via Email?Enter your address to receive our posts by Email.Email Address	Top Posts & PagesWhat to Eat in Uganda: Street Food	Myanmar: Mawlamyine Monasteries and Karen Jungles	Our Morning of Horror in the Vietnamese Jungle	Beer Review: Tanzania	Site Guide: Kawgoon Cave, Hpa-An Area, Karen State, Myanmar	We are Reading:All content © Leckie + Laura 2015 - Contact Us"
