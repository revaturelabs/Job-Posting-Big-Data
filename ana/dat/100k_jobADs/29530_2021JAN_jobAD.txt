Over the years I have tried many different techniques. The computer has multiplied the possibilities to create pictures.I love to make pictures. That is my vocation, my destiny. I don't want to do anything else because it fills me with so much joy that nothing else can compare to it. I cling to each of my pictures, even the less good ones, because a piece of my soul flows into each picture.If I have the time and I am doing well, I get up early in the morning, have breakfast and then sit down at the computer to make a picture. In my imagination the finished picture is already there and I try to get as close as possible to this imagination.I am so focused on my work that I forget everything around me.Sometimes I feel pain because I forget to go to the bathroom.After a short lunch break I sit down at the computer again.Working on an average picture can take a whole working day. Afterwards I am exhausted but still it is for the most beautiful thing in the world.Close×Login/RegisterPlease login to add this item to your cart, or create an account below.UsernamePasswordConfirm PasswordEmailIf you are using a Microsoft email service (Hotmail, Outlook, Live, etc.) you will need to whitelist Renderosity.com prior to completing registration in order to receive a confirmation emailReferred By...
