Many employers much prefer someone they can rely on for at least a couple of shifts over the course of a week, however that doesn't mean that you won't be able to find anything by focusing on the major employers of part time staff in the area.Just like most places in the United Kingdom, finding Saturday jobs in south east London should involve a heavy focus on the many supermarket chains that serve the area including Costcutter, Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's. Each of these companies has gained an excellent reputation for not only treating their staff well and paying them slightly above the kind of money you'd expect from a casual job in a corner shop, but for providing all the tools necessary to allow part time employees to start making their way up the employment ladder.By partaking in on the job training and any additional training courses offered by the companies in question, you'll be able to set yourself up nicely for a shot at a full time career down the line when your situation has changed to allow you to look at more than just one day per week.Since you can't commit to anything long term right now, it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to get anything but the most introductory level of jobs, such as cashier. In this position you'll be able to make between £5.10 and £5.45 per hour, and will be required to deal with customers as the major part of your job, so a friendly, outgoing personality is absolutely essential.Tags:part time jobs,part time work London,part time retail work,weekend work,saturday jobs in south east londonOn the same subjectBy following this guide you'll be able to find weekend jobs in Essex in no timeFind jobs part time in Salisbury todayLooking for jobs part time in Barnstaple?We can help you in your search for jobs part time in HatfieldFind jobs for the weekend in Hendon with this guideHot Topicsfull time jobsuk jobspart time jobsjobswork onlinecoursesWork from home jobstemp jobsJobs Abroadretail jobsOur themesEntertainmentFashion & BeautyHome & FoodLifestyleTravelMoney & CareerMotoringSocialAll channelsMoneyInsuranceJobsExplore categoriesEmployment NewsFull time jobsPart time jobsJobs AbroadWork onlineCoursesRetail industryFood industryOffice jobsAdmin jobsExcite.ukInfo ExciteWho we arePrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceFeedbackGDPRExcite EuropeExcite ItaliaExcite DeutschlandExcite EspañaExcite FranceExcite NederlandExcite USAStay connected with usFacebookTwitterYoutubeGoogleRssUnited Kingdom - Excite Network Copyright ©1995 - 2021"
