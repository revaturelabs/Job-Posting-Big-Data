Not necessarily an uncomfortable one, but it just seems like there’s nothing more to say for the time being? I think this is the blog equivalent of that.Yep.I’m going through something of an identity crisis, I suppose. Nothing seems a) important enough or b) timely enough to put on the site anymore. When I started, I was watching a ton more TV and movies and could easily fill my blog with reviews or news of upcoming shows. A change in my work schedule and more time spent actually writing has meant a serious decrease in TV viewing, so I really don’t have that to fall back on now.For example: I just watched Gone Girl. I thought maybe I could devote a post either to a full-fledged review of the film, or a comparison of the book vs the film. Then I thought, isn’t it a little late to be talking about it? I mean, I’ll tell you what I thought of it, but to spend a few hundred words on a movie that came out several months ago seems a little late.Anyway, regarding the movie: I liked it a lot, and thought it was just as good as—if not better than—the book. The things that didn’t make the film were pretty minor, and Gillian Flynn did a pretty excellent job adapting her novel for the screen. As much as I like Trent Reznor’s work, I felt like in some scenes the music was a distraction from what was going on. When Nick and Amy were having a huge blow-out fight, hearing a film score under it (even a somewhat ominous one) took me out of the scene.The real highlight of the film for me was Rosamund Pike. I literally can’t think of anyone who could’ve pulled off Amazing Amy so perfectly. Cold, calculating, psychotic…her performance was awesome. I don’t know whether or not she’ll win the Oscar, but I think she definitely deserved the nomination.Want a Netflix recommendation? I’ve got one of those I can throw your way.If you’ve never heard of Better Off Ted, you’re not alone. It was only on for two very low-rated seasons on ABC back in the days of yore (2009-2010) when people still watched TV primarily on TV instead of their devices. Take it from me, though, this show is hilarious.Part romantic workplace comedy, part biting satire of corporate America, and part screwball comedy, how this show never caught on is one of life’s biggest mysteries (because I don’t use my brain to think about things like science or the universe). Once I saw the show was on Netflix I went back to re-watch what I remembered to be my favorite episode and it totally held up, so a BOT marathon may be in the works.If you’re going to give it a shot and want one episode to see if you like it, I point to “Racial Sensitivity” from season one. The show is set at the headquarters of megacorporation Veridian Dynamics, a sort of SC Johnson or Glad type industry giant, and in a cost-saving measure all the lights, elevators, water fountains, etc. in the building are replaced with motion-sensors that turn off automatically when not in use. The problem? The sensors are defective, and do not detect light reflected off darker skin tones—i.e., they don’t work for black people. The solution? Replacing all the sensors is initially deemed too expensive, so as a temporary fix the company hires a bunch of white people, paying them minimum wage to follow the black people everywhere.Exchange between Ted and his boss (and company puppet) Veronica:Ted: “The sensors don’t see black people? …That’s racist!”Veronica: “The company’s position is that it’s actually the opposite of racist, because the system isn’t targeting black people, it’s just ignoring them. They insist the worst people can call it is indifferent.”As I write I get more anxious to go back and re-watch the whole series—it really is that good. Give it a shot!And now, I submit the BOJ suggestion box. Like I said at the top, topics for blog posts are getting a little thin. I have a few ideas, but I’m open to ideas. Soon I should have more writing-related things to talk about as I move from the actual writing of my first novel to trying to get it published, so there’ll be some material there, but what else?One thing I’ve been bouncing around is a series of “In Defense of…” posts, where I defend something in pop culture that’s either (unjustly) unpopular or was overlooked by the population at large. I may start the first installment of that next week if I don’t think of anything else. So, if you have ideas, suggestions, feedback, whatever it may be, feel free to let me know. What kinds of things would you like to see discussed here?Share this:TweetShare on TumblrMoreEmailLike this:Like Loading...RelatedPosted byKenneth Jobe February 3, 2015 January 17, 2021 Posted inBlogTags:Better Off Ted, gillian flynn, Gone Girl, Movies, oscar, oscars, Rosamund Pike, TV	Published by Kenneth Jobe	Kenneth Jobe is a writer, photographer, musician, and Native Californian living in the Midwest with his wife and son.

I do series posts that are connected but that’s about it. I realized that when I’m talking about my day-to-day real life, I get more views/shares than when I stay on topic.Good luck!ReplyKenneth Jobe says:	February 6, 2015 at 8:19 AMIt’s been an ongoing issue for me, and part of the reason I decided to take all of November off—I wanted to focus solely on writing and didn’t want the blog hanging over my head. Hopefully I’ll find my niche soon. Thanks!ReplyCourtney Wright says:	February 3, 2015 at 7:49 PMThanks for the reviews… my DVR is literally full of TV shows I am way behind watching. There are a few I watch immediately or within a day or two, but others are just hanging out for truly a day I am bored and there is nothing else to watch. I gave up several shows this year because my priorities have changed. That is all. I choose to spend my time doing something else.Anyway… a little bit of trivia regarding Gone Girl. It was filmed in Cape Girardeau, MO. My best friend lives there and I used to own a business there. The stars were seen all over town including shopping at the local Academy store where my friend’s son works. Ben Afleck was in there several times. My friend was the GM for Lenscrafters and Reese Witherspoon came in for a new pair of glasses. I don’t know if they needed them for the movie or personally. But my GF was asked if she wanted to be an extra in the movie because she had exactly the “look” they wanted and SHE TURNED THEM DOWN! I was like… “WHA? Are you kidding?” “Yeah”… she said, “I have no desire to be in a movie!” I just do not understand that at all… *smh*The general consensus around town was that everyone was actually pretty great to deal with and happy to contribute to the local economy. I thought that was kinda cool… with one exception. Neil Patrick Harris was a douche! A real diva…… 😦ReplyKenneth Jobe says:	February 6, 2015 at 8:23 AMThat stinks, I like NPH! I guess you never can tell how people are in real life…I don’t get your friend, either. I was an extra in the movie Contact with Jodie Foster. You can’t even see me in the movie but it was a blast. Your friend is weird. 🙂Replyjustme792 says:	February 4, 2015 at 7:04 AMAnything writing related always gets my attention. Even if you’re just telling us you finished another few pages, or got some editing done. I love to read about the process of writing and getting published, so don’t hold back on that (not for me at least, haha). I’m not that into the review posts (films, series, etc.), but some short suggestion posts might work for me ^^ And the series of “In Defense Of…” posts just sound great! Can’t wait to see what you come up with and how you defend it…Good luck with everything! I’ll be around 😉ReplyKenneth Jobe says:	February 6, 2015 at 8:21 AMI should have more writing-related things to talk about soon, but these past few months I’ve been stuck in a cycle of writing with nothing really new going on. Soon I’ll have to go about trying to get my novel published, which opens a whole new world—query letters, elevator pitches, etc. I’ll keep you informed!ReplyCourtney Wright says:	February 6, 2015 at 9:28 AMThat is totally cool. I would love to meet Jodie Foster! I don’t understand her either! ha ha ha!! And yeah… she is weird, but she is truly my soulmate friend and I can’t imagine my life without her. Even if she makes stupid decisions sometimes! LOL! 😉ReplyWhat's on your mind?
