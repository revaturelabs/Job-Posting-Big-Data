They get to wear these pretty dresses, and they get to fly all the time! For free! And they get to go to different places. How exciting! (In my defence, I was a kid.) I thought their only job was to help the passengers! And enjoying the flight, of course.The first time I flew, it was an eye-opener. In the airport, I saw so many air hostesses, they were dressed so prettily! They looked like dolls. I was pointing them out to my mother and shrieking “omg if I become one, I get to wear pretty dresses!!” My mom didn’t say anything, she was just smirking.Then we boarded the plane. There was an air hostess who was escorting people to their seats. After the plane took off, yet another one started giving instructions. So far so good. Then after a while, two of them brought us food. Everything was going fine. But then, after everybody had eaten, they came and started collecting everybody’s trash. Oh, well. Seems like we had a bit of a problem. I’m a very lazy person who, half the time, asks my dad to bring me water from the kitchen which is two steps away. Me, collecting trash? Yeah, that was hilarious. Oh, boy. My mom silently started smirking beside me.Me: *groans and covers face with hands*My dreams are shattering before my eyes and you laugh, mother?Mom: *full-on laughing now*Me: I can see the pieces of my shattered dream on the floor.Mom: Oh, stop being so dramatic. *rolls eyes*Oh, and they were supposed to be nice to all the passengers. Even the ones who were rude and irritating. And we all know I’m not nice. I’m incapable of being nice to people who are rude and irritating! And, it turns out, there’s a minimum height requirement, too.Oh, well. I guess that career path is put for me. *deep dramatic sigh*P.S. No offence to any air-hostesses out there.-RShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...RelatedSeptember 23, 2015 September 23, 2015 · Posted in Rantings · Tagged humor, true story ·55 thoughts on “The air-hostess job.”	Vibrant says:	September 23, 2015 at 1:41 pmWonderful post.I also found air-hostesses cute.Love and light ❤Anand 🙂LikeLiked by 2 peopleReplymissbookthief says:	September 23, 2015 at 1:41 pmThank you, Anand.

Haha.LikeLiked by 1 personReplyTejaswi says:	September 23, 2015 at 2:14 pmAh, never mind.. my daughter does that to me already.. send me to the kitchen to get her water.. and whatever else she needs..But long before you were born, perhaps, there used to be a serial on DD called Air-Hostess, starring Kitu Gidwani.. and boy, who would not have wanted to be air-hostesses then 😀 Even little boys with half a brain wanted to be pilots just so they could be on the same flight hahaha.. (OH come on… I had a lot of friends in that field.. so many of them pretty but pretty hollow-headed too.. and some of them.. well.. smart but pretending to be idiots… )LikeLiked by 2 peopleReplymissbookthief says:	September 23, 2015 at 2:16 pmHahahaha! My dad never complains, though. Sometimes I feel bad. Oh, wait. I don’t! xDLikeLiked by 1 personReplyTejaswi says:	September 23, 2015 at 2:16 pmNope, you don’t.. not that you are any different from my daughter 😐LikeLiked by 1 personmissbookthief says:	September 23, 2015 at 2:17 pmHahaha! *grins*LikeLiked by 1 personNJ says:	September 23, 2015 at 2:20 pmNice one 🙂 but you know I was named after an airhostess :p …Neerja Bhanot 🙂 if you don’t know who she was just google it out 🙂 as I am proud to be named after her 🙂LikeLiked by 1 personReplymissbookthief says:	September 23, 2015 at 2:22 pmI will. 🙂 I don’t have anything against air-hostesses. It’s just that I’m too lazy, and a bit.. Not nice? xDLikeLiked by 1 personReplyNJ says:	September 23, 2015 at 2:28 pmHa ha 😀 …even I wanted to be one at time 😉 but when you grow up you realize the reality :pLikeLiked by 1 personmissbookthief says:	September 23, 2015 at 2:29 pmExactly!

After reading your summer story seemed apt.LikeLiked by 3 peopleReplymissbookthief says:	September 23, 2015 at 3:06 pmHaha, true. But, at home, I can sit in the AC and read. Or write. xD *grins* What can I say? I’m lazy. *shrugs*LikeLiked by 1 personReplyQuirky Girl says:	September 23, 2015 at 3:05 pmSuch a seemingly glamourous job, and yet so much rubbish involved. I’ve never been a fan of trash or rude people, either.Thanks for stopping by my blog, comically quirky! I’m so glad you did. Your blog is terrific!LikeLiked by 2 peopleReplymissbookthief says:	September 23, 2015 at 3:07 pmExactly! That day I was like, ohmygod they clear trash? Somebody else’s trash? You’re welcome, quirky girl. I loved your blog. 😀LikeLiked by 1 personReplyphdinmeblog.wordpress.com says:	September 23, 2015 at 4:30 pmGreat Blog!

I don’t get sick, or panicked. As long as you give me plenny’o’Whiskey 😉LikeLiked by 1 personReplymissbookthief says:	September 24, 2015 at 9:09 amHahaha! I just sit quietly and read.LikeLikeReplyUday says:	September 23, 2015 at 7:54 pmI guess the novelty loses after a while. I mean, how many times can you fly, smile at people, sell refreshments and collect trash before it gets too mundane! But yes, it’s an important and a respectable job so we should be glad to have them I suppose. I’d love to do it for a day (just saying). Though I might not even qualify as I think male flight attendants need to be gorgeous too. (have you seen the ones on SpiceJet?)LikeLiked by 1 personReplymissbookthief says:	September 24, 2015 at 9:10 amI’d love doing it for a day, too. Not more than that, though. No, I haven’t travelled SpiceJet, yet.LikeLikeReplyfluffy! says:	September 23, 2015 at 9:37 pmBut I still want to be one.LikeLiked by 1 personReplymissbookthief says:	September 24, 2015 at 9:11 amYou should, if you want to. I still love them, though. Just that I’m lazy and rude. xDLikeLikeReplyMiss Twisted Sense Of Humor says:	September 24, 2015 at 3:03 pmHahahaha!! You and a air hostess??!! You would be the shortest amd rudest one 8f them all if by any chance you had become one. But hey, atleast your swear words could be colour full 😛LikeLiked by 1 personReplyMiss Book Thief says:	September 24, 2015 at 3:28 pmHahaha! Can’t argue with that! You know you’re one of the very few people who can get away with saying such stuff to me, right? hehehe. Colourful swear words, ooooh. Me likey. xDLikeLiked by 1 personReplyMiss Twisted Sense Of Humor says:	September 24, 2015 at 3:42 pmYup, know that and love that 😀LikeLiked by 1 personMiss Book Thief says:	September 24, 2015 at 3:43 pmHehehe. :*LikeLiked by 1 personhasmeetwrites says:	September 24, 2015 at 5:27 pmThe hardest job!

I mean yes, the pretty dresses. And how they’re flying all the time. And are generally so nice. I also used to think that they could eat all the airplane food they wanted.But then I went and found out that they don’t get to ride by the window seat.Seemed fair enough of an argument to change my mind.LikeLiked by 1 personReplyMiss Book Thief says:	October 2, 2015 at 2:09 pmHahaha, I know. Plus, they have to be nice all the time. I decided it wasn’t for me.LikeLikeReplyarchana235 says:	October 2, 2015 at 2:10 pmExactly! 😀LikeLiked by 1 personMiss Book Thief says:	October 2, 2015 at 2:11 pmGlamorous on the outside, on the inside.. Hmm, not so much. I’m happy reading books at home! 😀LikeLikearchana235 says:	October 2, 2015 at 2:15 pmYes!I even used to think giving those safety instructions was super cool. Now that I think of it, doing it about 17 times in 48 hours? Not so much.My bed is my happy place.LikeLiked by 1 personMiss Book Thief says:	October 2, 2015 at 2:16 pmAgreed. Bed is bliss. You can sleep all day long, if you want to. 😀LikeLiked by 1 personLeave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
