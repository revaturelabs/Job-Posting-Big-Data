Many employees are family members. ‘Great Health. Generation to Generation’ means not only that staff are here to care for all of your family’s generations, but that many generations of families come together to provide that care for you. It is not unusual to find close family members – parents and children, spouses, and siblings – as well as extended family – aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, cousins and even grandparents and grandchildren – at work.Garden City Hospital is proud to be a part of the community, and proud of the community the hospital itself has become. Whether you were born here, your entire family receives care here, or if it’s your first time coming to the hospital, the staff will strive to make your experience welcoming and comfortable.For more information about Garden City Hospital or to find a Garden City Hospital physician, call 1-877-717-WELL.Job DescriptionResponsibilities The House Supervisor is a Registered Nurse who assumes administrative responsibility for the management of all department service functions on his/her shift.
