While preparing and considering all the details, it can be easy to lose sight of what a job interview is: a conversation with a potential employer where you must sell yourself as the right candidate for the job. The following tips are all good advice for accomplishing this.Be AuthenticIt can be challenging to be especially authentic during a job interview because you want to impress the employer and get the job. You may, therefore, be tempted to present yourself as someone you think they are looking for, even when you’re not. This strategy is unlikely to result in long-term success, though. Even if you get the job, your team members, the company culture, and the job itself may not be a good fit for you.It is best, to be honest from the beginning and realize that a job interview is really about both parties evaluating whether this will be a good match. While you should be entirely professional, you also need to let your personality shine through so employers can determine if you are genuinely a good fit for the role.Focus On How You Can Benefit Or Improve The CompanyThe interviewer has one goal: determine what you can do for them. Your task is to rise up and effectively answer this question. Instead of focusing on what you want and what you have done, you should instead frame the interview around what you can do for the company. Ideally, you will have done your research and found some information about the company and the position. You can also ask questions during the interview to get more information as to the nature of what the company needs from this position. The focus on what they need is one of the most effective ways to sell yourself during a job interview.Admit Your FaultsIf you only discuss the best aspects of yourself, an interviewer will sense you are not particularly authentic. A typical interview question is to ask about your greatest weakness because employers want to see how you will answer it. When addressing your failures, you should explain how they have helped you grow as a person and become a more skilled professional. Mentioning skills that you have improved or are working on improving demonstrates your commitment to self-improvement. Be sure to be specific and relate an accomplishment or anecdote that proves you have indeed improved.Ask QuestionsA final way you can impress during the job interview is by asking questions. This is generally expected, but asking questions throughout and at the end of the meeting shows the interviewer that you are engaged and interested in the job. These questions are your opportunity to make a final impression, clear up any confusion you still may have about any aspect of the job, make your last case of why they should hire you, and more. Come prepared to the interview with questions but also come up with more throughout the duration. Asking three to five questions is generally considered acceptable. Good questions to ask include:What would you expect success to look like in this position?Is there anything else that is important for me to know about the role?Do you have any further questions about my background or abilities?Do you have any hesitations about my qualifications?What is your timeline for making a decision?Selling yourself as an ideal employee for an open position is the entire point of an interview. Go into each one with that goal in mind. By using the right techniques and going in with the right mindset, you can successfully convince an employer that you are the right person for the job.Share this entryShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Google+Share on LinkedinShare on RedditShare by Mailhttps://www.patenteducationseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/selling-yourself.jpg 589 1000 Editorial Staff https://www.patenteducationseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/logo-centric-bw.png Editorial Staff2020-07-28 08:02:512020-03-16 08:14:05Selling Yourself During A Job InterviewPRODUCT:Patent Bar ReviewFree Trial AccountCOMPANY:AboutBlogSupportCopyright © 2020 Patent Education Series.
