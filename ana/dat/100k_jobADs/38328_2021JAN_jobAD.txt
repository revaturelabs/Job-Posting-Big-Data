Now the reports look enlarged to fit in the table spacing of the report. The previous version was more condensed and easier to read. It would be helpful if this change was reverted or we had the options to set the sizing of the table to manipulate the view.4 votesVoteVoteVoteSign inprestineYour nameYour email address(thinking…)PasswordSign in with: Facebook GoogleForgot password?Create a passwordI agree to the terms of serviceSigned in as (Sign out)CloseCloseVoteWe’ll send you updates on this idea0 comments · Dashboard · Flag idea as inappropriate…Flag idea as inappropriate…· Delete… · Admin →Include Activity in Contact ReportWould like to have the option when exporting Contact list into CSV to include activity for Contacts as well.1 voteVoteVoteVoteSign inprestineYour nameYour email address(thinking…)PasswordSign in with: Facebook GoogleForgot password?Create a passwordI agree to the terms of serviceSigned in as (Sign out)CloseCloseVoteWe’ll send you updates on this idea0 comments · Custom Reports · Flag idea as inappropriate…Flag idea as inappropriate…· Delete… · Admin →Meta audit logMeta audit log, to track changes in JN and who made the changes1 voteVoteVoteVoteSign inprestineYour nameYour email address(thinking…)PasswordSign in with: Facebook GoogleForgot password?Create a passwordI agree to the terms of serviceSigned in as (Sign out)CloseCloseVoteWe’ll send you updates on this idea0 comments · Custom Reports · Flag idea as inappropriate…Flag idea as inappropriate…· Edit… · Delete… · Admin →freeze report headersReport headers should be able to be frozen and locked so you can scroll down without losing the column title.2 votesVoteVoteVoteSign inprestineYour nameYour email address(thinking…)PasswordSign in with: Facebook GoogleForgot password?Create a passwordI agree to the terms of serviceSigned in as (Sign out)CloseCloseVoteWe’ll send you updates on this idea0 comments · Custom Reports · Flag idea as inappropriate…Flag idea as inappropriate…· Delete… · Admin →Jobs report including option to separate contact information columnsJobs report should include option to separate contact information columns, ie Address Line 1, Email, Main phone (similarly to how Contacts report works)2 votesVoteVoteVoteSign inprestineYour nameYour email address(thinking…)PasswordSign in with: Facebook GoogleForgot password?Create a passwordI agree to the terms of serviceSigned in as (Sign out)CloseCloseVoteWe’ll send you updates on this idea0 comments · Custom Reports · Flag idea as inappropriate…Flag idea as inappropriate…· Delete… · Admin →automationI would like a report that lists all automations that are active, including parameters and actions.1 voteVoteVoteVoteSign inprestineYour nameYour email address(thinking…)PasswordSign in with: Facebook GoogleForgot password?Create a passwordI agree to the terms of serviceSigned in as (Sign out)CloseCloseVoteWe’ll send you updates on this idea0 comments · Flag idea as inappropriate…Flag idea as inappropriate…· Edit… · Delete… · Admin →Reports - return to where you left offWhen going through a report, we click on a job on page 3 of the report...when we want to return to the report, we'd like to return to spot where we left off as opposed to returning to the first page of the report.

Add a way to see the names without having to hover over the bar on the report or zoom in.

The numbers that are extracted are NOT NUMBERS – so you cannot do numerical formulas with them. It would be very helpful if at least the numbers would work, otherwise, someone has to go each cell and convert each cell to a number.2 votesVoteVoteVoteSign inprestineYour nameYour email address(thinking…)PasswordSign in with: Facebook GoogleForgot password?Create a passwordI agree to the terms of serviceSigned in as (Sign out)CloseCloseVoteWe’ll send you updates on this idea0 comments · Custom Reports · Flag idea as inappropriate…Flag idea as inappropriate…· Delete… · Admin →Description field used as job number entry linePlease add the Description field from Contact page (suggestion: field is used as job number) to work orders, reports, production boards so that when that field is used as the job number, it can be added to those reports to easily view the job number or customer name.1 voteVoteVoteVoteSign inprestineYour nameYour email address(thinking…)PasswordSign in with: Facebook GoogleForgot password?Create a passwordI agree to the terms of serviceSigned in as (Sign out)CloseCloseVoteWe’ll send you updates on this idea0 comments · Flag idea as inappropriate…Flag idea as inappropriate…· Edit… · Delete… · Admin →Add Job Type to the Budget ReportsFor the love of all that is holy :)Can you please add a column for job types to the Budget Report creator in Reports in Job Nimbus.Sincerely,Every Contractor Everywhere :)2 votesVoteVoteVoteSign inprestineYour nameYour email address(thinking…)PasswordSign in with: Facebook GoogleForgot password?Create a passwordI agree to the terms of serviceSigned in as (Sign out)CloseCloseVoteWe’ll send you updates on this idea0 comments · Custom Reports · Flag idea as inappropriate…Flag idea as inappropriate…· Delete… · Admin →Edit Multiple Records at One Time on DashboardIt would be great if we could just select multiple records on a dashboard report and update/edit those records at one time, similar to a bulk edit but with a more user-friendly option of clicking to select the records you need to change and then being able to update the data in a column for those records.3 votesVoteVoteVoteSign inprestineYour nameYour email address(thinking…)PasswordSign in with: Facebook GoogleForgot password?Create a passwordI agree to the terms of serviceSigned in as (Sign out)CloseCloseVoteWe’ll send you updates on this idea0 comments · Flag idea as inappropriate…Flag idea as inappropriate…· Delete… · Admin →Material Order Report - Option to Display Purchase/Price AmountsI need the material order report to show totals of amounts purchased, quantity and total price3 votesVoteVoteVoteSign inprestineYour nameYour email address(thinking…)PasswordSign in with: Facebook GoogleForgot password?Create a passwordI agree to the terms of serviceSigned in as (Sign out)CloseCloseVoteWe’ll send you updates on this idea0 comments · Custom Reports · Flag idea as inappropriate…Flag idea as inappropriate…· Delete… · Admin →Material Order Report Filter - Supplier/Line itemUser would like to have the ability to filter line items (products/services) as well as Suppliers in order to accurately view the cost per job as it relates to different suppliers.
