Tech unemployment started 2020 at 3% and ranged from a low of 2.4% to a high of 4.6% during the year.Tech Sector Hiring Led by Services, Software JobsDecember hiring within the IT sector was paced by the addition of 20,300 jobs in the IT services and custom software development category in the employment category, an important indicator of small and medium-size business activity.Also in positive territory were the categories of data processing, hosting and related services (+ 2,600), computer, electronics and semiconductor manufacturing (+ 1,600) and other information services, including search portals (+ 200). Telecommunications employment declined by 2,500 jobs.During 2020 the U.S. IT sector recorded six months of employment growth and six months of job losses. IT occupation employment experienced seven months of growth and five months of declines in 2020. Last month’s addition of an estimated 391,000 new positions represented the largest monthly gain last year.Tech Job Postings UpAnother positive sign was a modest increase in the number of employer job postings for core information technology positions, to nearly 207,000 in December.
