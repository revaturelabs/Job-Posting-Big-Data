Haley Barbour told Fox News on Sunday about the Labor Department’s jobs report for June.The employment rate has hovered at 8.2 percent for the second straight month – adding only 80,000 jobs in June. It’s an increase from May’s 77,000 jobs.“In the last quarter we added fewer jobs than during the Reagan recovery after the ’82 recession we were adding more jobs every month than we added in the last three months,” Barbour said. “And how can you say it is progress when last month more people signed up for Social Security disability than got a job.”However, it’s the finger pointing that has prevented the economy from truly being repaired, he also said.Fox News7/8/12FacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsAppPrevious articleBarbour: A lot to love about RomneyNext articleHearing today in Zach Scruggs’ appealYallPolitics StaffThis article was produced by Y'all Politics staff.RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOREducationTeacher pay raise bill moves forward in Mississippi SenateElected OfficialsHinds County opposes landfill in Madison CountyHeadlinesPascagoula’s Sarah Thomas to be first female to officiate in a Super BowlBlock titleBusinessCORDER: No, Joe!
