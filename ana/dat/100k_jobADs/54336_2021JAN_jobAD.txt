If required, we also use this to process your DBS check certificate.Key Care & Support incur costs from our training providers for Mandatory Training Day, supplying your uniform/badge and (if required) your DBS check. We only ask for the small amount of £60 to ensure that we do not loose out if we process all your application materials and pay for your Mandatory Training then you decide not to continue your application.Unfortunately, we have, in the past, had Care staff wish to join us, benefited from our free training, uniform and (if required) DBS check, to then go on to another employment without working for us, taking advantage of the excellent opportunities that have been given them by Key Care & Support.The £60 is a commitment from you that you will continue your application with us until we get you working.CLOSEWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.
