Every Monday we bring you the best stories and guests from around the world relating to technology, psychology, and society.Podcast Subscription Menu	Visit WebsiteRSS FeedChanging The 'Chatter' Of Our Inner Voice From Destructive To Productiveby Sam Brake GuiaAs Elon Musk’s Neuralink and other implantable brain-machine interfaces continue to advance, it seems like we will soon be living in a world where our mind can control everything.But before we reach this future, it is important for us to first understand our own minds, how they work, and how to control them. In this episode, we will explore the power and importance of our inner voice.To better understand the chatter in our heads, we are joined by Ethan Kross, an award-winning professor at the Psychology department of the University of Michigan. He is also the author of the new book CHATTER: The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It, which comes out today.In this episode, we discuss the TED talk “Mind Control: How to win the war in your head” and why our inner voice can often be very negative. We also look at how we can change this, shaping our inner dialogue to become more positive, thus creating the basis of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).In addition to this, you will learn how meditation influences our inner voice, his work relating to social media and well-being, why using our name when talking with ourselves can help us overcome difficult situations. Kross also explains how he uses mental time travel to put problems into perspective.Search EpisodesClear SearchChanging The 'Chatter' Of Our Inner Voice From Destructive To ProductiveJanuary 26, 2021Sam Brake GuiaSocial Media and our Psychology (Don't Worry, We'll Talk It Out)January 19, 2021Sam Brake GuiaBrain Plasticity: How Technology, Environments, and Language Change Our BrainsJanuary 12, 2021Sam Brake GuiaSoftware That Predicts Employee Burnout Through LanguageJanuary 5, 2021Sam Brake GuiaBrains Byte Back: The Best of 2020December 29, 2020Sam Brake GuiaIncreasing Happiness With Evidence-Based TechniquesDecember 22, 2020Sam Brake GuiaHeuristics: How Our Mental Short Cuts Can Mislead UsDecember 15, 2020Sam Brake GuiaThe gift-giving AI for businesses that increases sales by 40xDecember 7, 2020Sam Brake GuiaBuilding A More Efficient, Privacy-Focused Future With Smart CitiesNovember 30, 2020Sam Brake GuiaUnderstanding the Dangers of Social MediaNovember 23, 2020Sam Brake GuiaLoad MoreSearch Results placeholderPrevious EpisodeShow Episodes ListNext EpisodeShow Podcast Informationpopular postsNeurodata Lab, partners with Promobot demonstrating important strides towards the goal of developing empathetic AI2 years ago‘Selfitis’: Obsessive selfie taking as a real disorder and the fake news stories that inspired its research3 years agoThe Economic Impacts of Innovation3 years agoRecent postsChanging the ‘chatter’ of our inner voice from destructive to productive (podcast) January 26, 2021Globalists embrace leveraging social media, location & behavioral data for alternative credit scoring January 22, 2021Work with Us	Jobs @ Espacio Media Incubator2018 Espacio Media Incubator, All Rights ReservedCopyright © 2017"
