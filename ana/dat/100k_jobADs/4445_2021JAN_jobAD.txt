The parent company is now Haier Electronics of China.Background to the current consultationThe company explained the background to the ongoing and statutory consultation and the company’s decision to centralise a number of functions to Warrington. The consultation involves 45 job roles, and the company is having a series of consultation meetings with the staff and staff representatives about their personal situations. If the plans move forward, then the changes would take place by around spring 2020.Sadly, the staff group affected do not have trade union recognition. The company unfortunately would not “facilitate” a meeting we had hoped to have with some of the staff on the site today. We are making alternative arrangements to meet staff in the near future. We do not propose to make detailed comments until we have spoken with those staff.Hoover is in contact with the Welsh Government and depending on the final outcome from the current consultation, a range of advice and support will be offered to staff.Distribution remains in Merthyr TydfilIn better news, the company did confirm that the distribution operation will remain in Merthyr Tydfil, and the business plan hopes to see growth in this activity in future. The company is currently investing in the warehousing facilities on Hoover’s Merthyr Tydfil site. Unite the Union represents the warehousing and distribution staff.We understand that consultation about redundancies is a sensitive and upsetting issue for those involved, and so we hope to speak with any staff who would like to meet us in the near future.Gerald Jones MPOldway House, Castle Street, Merthyr Tydfil CF47 8UX01685 383739[email protected]Dawn Bowden AM110 High Street, Merthyr Tydfil CF47 8AP01685 386672[email protected]Comments for this post are closed.USEFUL LINKS (LOCAL)Gerald Jones MPNational Assembly for WalesWelsh GovernmentMerthyr County CouncilCaerphilly County CouncilUK ParliamentUSEFUL LINKS (OTHER)South Wales PolicePolice and Crime Commissioner South WalesGwent PoliceGwent Police and Crime CommissionerSouth Wales Fire and Rescue ServiceGET IN TOUCHGet in touch by completing my online contact form here.Alternatively, you can contact my office using the details below.Address:110 High StreetMerthyr Tydfil , CF47 8APTelephone: 01685 386672Email: [email protected]ONLINE CONTACT FORMCopyright © 2019 Dawn Bowden MS / AS | Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney | Developed by ePolitixDesignNeither the National Assembly for Wales, nor Dawn Bowden, are responsible for the content of external links or websitesThis site uses cookies: Find out more.Okay, thanks"
