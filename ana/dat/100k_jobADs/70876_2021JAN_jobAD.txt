We have been awarded a Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award grant for 3 years to identify ways of improving the efficacy of malaria prevention in an insecticide resistant Africa. The project is inter-disciplinary with a strong focus on economics.Impressive reductions in malaria have occurred throughout sub-Saharan Africa over the past 12 years. However progress has not been geographically uniform and there are some high-burden countries where, despite good coverage with long lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), parasite prevalence rates and mortality from malaria remain obstinately high. Burkina Faso falls into this category. This project will collect extensive empirical data and use models of malaria transmission to quantify the level of protection provided by LLINs and investigate the potential efficacy and limitations of alternative malaria control tools. The aim is to identify the most cost effective, complementary interventions that would drive malaria transmission towards zero.The post holder will collect, collate and analyse data to estimate the economic cost of delivering malaria control interventions in Burkina Faso. Then, in collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team s/he will develop cost effectiveness estimates for alternative malaria intervention packages considering acceptability, affordability and financing options. The output from this work will be of critical importance for advising country programmes and donors on strategies to maintain vector control in the face of increasing insecticide resistance.You will be a highly motivated individual, possessing MSc level or above in health economics or related discipline e.g. microeconomics, development economics or agricultural economics. You will have experience of economic evaluation, preferably cost effectiveness analysis with well-developed research skills and the ability to present research findings. Experienced of living and/or working in Africa would be a distinct advantage.The ability to understand complex trade-offs and clearly articulate these to guide-decision making is essential so you must have proven communication skills. Experience with mathematical models and informing policy at national or global level is desirable. The candidate must be able to work productively as part of a multi-cultural, multidisciplinary team. You will be expected to show tenacity and tact when dealing directly with country partners, policy makers and funding agencies.A working knowledge of French is essential for this role, as is a willingness to travel to the study site in Burkina Faso.Further details of the post can be found by visiting our website at: www.lstmed.ac.uk/vacanciesIf you are interested in applying, please return your completed Application Form, Personal Details Form and Equal Opportunities Monitoring Form together with a copy of your CV, stating vacancy reference number (083), via email to jobs@lstmed.ac.uk, or by post to HR, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Pembroke Place, Liverpool L3 5QAClosing Date: 31 March 2016, 12.00pm UK TimeLSTM actively promotes an Equal Opportunities PolicyDon't forget to mention MalariaWorld when applying for this position!Tags:job; vacancy; malariaMalariaWorld Jobs's blogLog in or register to post comments1966 readsNewsletterReceive the free weekly MalariaWorld newsletterSubscribe hereAuthor InformationMalariaWorld JobsOfflineLast seen: 1 year 11 months agoJoined: November 20, 2012 - 20:04Most Popular on MalariaWorldToday's:Modern Explanation for Plasmodium vivax Malarial RecurrencesBreaking news from clinical trials with Artemisia plantsVitamin C and malaria: beware!About UsArtequick: programmed for failureArtemisia against malaria: efficient but banished.LLIN, new products and the impact of/ on insecticide resistanceWhy screening houses is more cost-effective than bednetsAll time:Why should I log in to the MalariaWorld platform?6th MIM Pan-African Malaria Conference in DurbanForum Guidelines & RulesNEW!
