For machinery and equipment operators, it provides a solution that reduces fatigue often caused by enclosed wearable headphones.“What we achieved for this ANC headrest/chair is that the ANC performance is significantly improved over the current state-of-the-art result. In particular, some of the high-pitched noise, previously difficult to cancel out, can now be reduced,” said Tong Xiao.Attempts to deliver a practical ANC headset have been decades in progress.The system they describe is a remote acoustic approach using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) and a small, lightweight and retro-reflective membrane pick-up placed in the cavum concha of a user’s ear.LDVs typically have very high sensitivity with commercially available instruments able to resolve vibration displacements down to pm and velocities down to nm/s resolution. The membrane pick-up can be designed to be small and lightweight and have a wide dynamic range.“The results show that more than 10 dB sound attenuation can be obtained for an ultra-broadband frequency range up to 6 kHz in the ears for multiple sound sources and for various types of common environmental noise,” said Xiao.“This virtual ANC headphone system has significantly better performance than any other virtual error sensing solution in the published literature thus far.”Pump down the volume: Study finds noise-cancelling formulaMore information:Tong Xiao et al.
