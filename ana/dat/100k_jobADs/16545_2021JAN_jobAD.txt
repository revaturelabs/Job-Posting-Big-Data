The upcoming move by Nadella could see as many as 6,000 jobs cut within the week, reports Bloomberg news agencyIn a recently penned memo to all employees, CEO Satya Nadella stated, “Finally, every team across Microsoft must find ways to simplify and move faster, more efficiently. We will increase the fluidity of information and ideas by taking actions to flatten the organization and develop leaner business processes.”Many online commentators believe this to be Nadella’s forewarning of the upcoming job cuts.“Nothing is off the table in how we think about shifting our culture to deliver on this core strategy. Organizations will change. Mergers and acquisitions will occur. Job responsibilities will evolve. New partnerships will be formed. Tired traditions will be questioned. Our priorities will be adjusted. New skills will be built. New ideas will be heard. New hires will be made. Processes will be simplified. And if you want to thrive at Microsoft and make a world impact, you and your team must add numerous more changes to this list that you will be enthusiastic about driving,” noted Nadella, who took over Microsoft’s top position earlier this year, in the memo.The layoffs could greatly affect the UK, which houses 1,000 Microsoft employees in London, along with several other countries, reports UK-based The Independent.Posted in News.Post navigationEricsson to upgrade Etisalat Egypt network – Al-Tahrir News NetworkChinese hackers target Iraqi experts over oil interests – Al-Tahrir News NetworkSearch	CategoriesNewsRecent PostsSeven surreal places to visit in Marsa AlamA trip to Mount SinaiTop 10 travel destinations to celebrate New Year’s EveWashington Institute: significant economic reforms in Egypt ahead of economic summitRepublicans say any Iran nuclear deal signed by Obama will be void after he leaves officeAbout usContact usCommunity GuidelinesAdvertise with usTerms of usePowered by WordPress.
