The BES was originally scrapped and was only restored following relentless lobbying by the ICT sector in Ireland.The investigation by the European Commission is expected to take at least a year. It is unclear at present if there will be any retrospective implications of the schemes which have cost the exchequer hundreds of millions in foregone tax over the last 20 years.Last night, Hogan lashed out at the European Commission’s investigation. “The decision by the European Commission to suspend the Business Expansion Scheme and Seed Capital schemes generally is a serious blow to innovation. Many software companies were set up under these schemes and have contributed enormously to employment in this country.”Hogan continued: “BES schemes have helped to create around 500 new software jobs every year, and the suspension of this scheme is bound to damage growth in this vital sector of industry. This is a very serious matter for entrepreneurs who are in the process of launching new start-ups. Speed to market is critical for many start-ups, particularly in the hi-tech sector. If Irish companies are not being formed to launch new products, you can be sure our competitors in the US and Israel will be.”Hogan said it was regrettable that Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy did not seek prior approval for the extension of the schemes before the completion of the Finance Act 2004, which prompted the EU investigation. He urged McCreevy to use his position as Ecofin president to bring the investigation to a conclusion within weeks and not months in order to restore investor certainty. “Many projects may now have to be suspended or delayed until the European Commission completes this unwieldy and unnecessary investigation,” Hogan warned.Earlier this week Enterprise Ireland said it was working closely with the department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance to ensure the continued operation of the schemes as a priority. “If the current position persists in any protracted way it will create a serious barrier for entrepreneurs at a point when the development of their businesses and securing international sales requires early stage risk finance not available from other sources,” Enterprise Ireland said in a statement.By John KennedyRelated: Enterprise Ireland, EVsYou May Also LikeYou May Also LikeStart-upsZipp Mobility teams up with Luna on ‘smart’ e-scooters1 day ago238 ViewsStart-upsE-scooter start-up Zeus raises €2m to expand European operations4 days ago593 ViewsInnovationIrish Government allocated €869m to R&D in 20205 days ago876 ViewsStart-upsFingal County Council lays the groundwork for e-scooters6 days ago553 ViewsStart-upsGalenband: A small wearable that could have a big impact on stroke risk18 Jan 2021837 ViewsStart-upsEnterprise Ireland backs regional centres for life sciences and industry 4.022 Dec 2020634 ViewsLatest NewsCould Australia’s news media bargaining code break the internet?2 hours agoWould you buy an antibacterial smartphone?3 hours agoScientists shed new light on how stars are born3 hours agoEdtech start-up Esme Learning Solutions raises $7.5m4 hours agoWhat it’s like to work as a ‘data science evangelist’4 hours agoExploring the value of makerspaces in 21st-century education4 hours agoBirdwatch: Twitter’s new fact-checking programme8 hours agoTU Dublin partners with Autodesk on new construction education centre8 hours agoInsurtech firm EverQuote to hire 70 in Northern Ireland9 hours agoGrindr could be fined almost €10m for violating GDPR10 hours agoEuropean investment hit record high in 2020, despite Covid-1911 hours agoPersonio to hire 140 at new business and engineering hub13 hours agoDraper Esprit leads $20m funding round in quantum computing firm1 day ago15 new jobs for Fermanagh amid £1m investment1 day agoLiving with Covid has failed, it’s time to try living without it1 day agoHow to bring your team on board with AI in the workplace1 day agoDrone company Wingcopter raises $22m1 day agoSurvey: One in four firms want to make Covid vaccine mandatory1 day agoZipp Mobility teams up with Luna on ‘smart’ e-scooters1 day agoUnibuddy: A scale-up with big goals for human-centred decision-making1 day agoE-scooter start-up Zeus raises €2m to expand European operations4 days agoFirst premises connected in National Broadband Plan roll-out4 days agoBerlin-based HR start-up HiPeople raises $3m4 days agoGet your job search off to a great start this January4 days agoMore from BusinessLatest NewsMoreMoreHomeAboutContactAdvertiseSubscribePrivacy PolicyAll content copyright 2002-2021 Silicon Republic Knowledge & Events Management Ltd.
