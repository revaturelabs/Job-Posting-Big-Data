It was probably long ago. If you got one now, would it make an good impression on you? Do you think a potential employer might pull your resume out from the pile for a second look after receiving a handwritten thank you note in the mail? We bet they would.A thank you note provides one more opportunity for a potential employer to remember you and leave a lasting impression. Even if you don’t think you will get the job you could be on their mind for another one.Here are some other tips for making an impression with a thank you:-Be sure that the envelope and message inside is all handwritten. No labels or typing, it definitely loses impact.-Start with “Dear” and how you addressed them in the interview. Usually you can’t go wrong with Mr. or Mrs. Last name.-Always thank them for their time and the opportunity to interview for the position. Express how interesting the organization and the job sounds and that you are looking forward to hearing from them soon.-End the note in a positive and friendly tone, like “Thanks again!”Drop the thank you note in the mail just after the interview. It really could make all the difference!Do you send handwritten thank you notes?
