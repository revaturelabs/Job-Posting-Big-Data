The colleges are still churning out clerks and the degrees which they pass out with are no use in the private sector. Till the time no steps are taken to strengthen technical and proffessional education this situation is going to continue.ReplyRVS says:	December 9, 2007 at 17:38The vision of leaders in Himachal is very limited. The main reason for it is aged leadership. We can hear every leader making claims/announcements to open degree colleges. Their vision beyond it is blocked. They cannot ever understand the nature of job market.ReplyLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
