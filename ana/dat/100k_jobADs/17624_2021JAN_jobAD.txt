Job Projection Data is developed following the rules and jurisdiction of the US Department of Labor’s Employment & Training Administration. Indiana occupations score a rank from 1 to 10 in the categories below to produce a both short term and long term outlook rating. Once the outlook scores are calculated, the scores are averaged to assign a flame ranking (1 to 5) to each occupation.Total Openings (2 & 10 year projected openings including new and backfill positions)Growth Openings (growth openings by occupation)Percentage Change (from base year to projected year)Real Time Labor Market Information, (job posting data from online job boards collected by Burning Glass Technologies)Wages (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2018 Wage Estimates)As new projections and wage data is received, the flames are recalculated.
