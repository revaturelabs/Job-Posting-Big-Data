As model validators we safeguard the quality of ING’s models, which are used for all kinds of decision making purposes. We also contribute to the Model Risk Management (r)evolution that is picking up worldwide, given that models are imperfect representations of reality and hence may lead to financial losses and/or reputational damage. To effectively achieve these challenges, our Model Validation teams have been substantially growing in size lately and will further grow, also internationally.We are responsible for validating ICAAP and ILAAP models used by ING in about 40 countries all over the globe. We cover an interesting, wide and evolving model scope across several main risk areas, e.g. IRRBB (“Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”)/ALM (“Asset & Liability Management”), Liquidity Risk, Operational Risk and Business Risk. These models vary from those having a technically advanced quantitative orientation to those displaying strong expert judgment (in case of e.g. limited data availability). Our core business consists of independently assessing whether a particular model is fit for the purpose it was designed for, based on the business context, academic theories, empirical evidence, regulations, best practices & technological innovations. Effective challenge is key in our role.
