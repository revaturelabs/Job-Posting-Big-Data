When cops asked Walker for his ID, the passenger said he didn’t have any, prompting the officers to resort to ruthless violence in response.

The reason for the firing is “excessive use of force.” The investigation would be referred to the Clayton County Sheriff’s Office, which will ultimately decide whether criminal charges are warranted.But the press release also said that even though “The Sheriff ordered a signature bond courtesy for Mr. Walker 48 hours ago,” that still would not get him released immediately because “Mr. Walker has a felony probation warrant out of Fulton County for Cruelty to Children, Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon, and a Failure to Appear warrant out of Hapeville which resulted in Magistrate Court denying him a bond.”SHERIFF VICTOR HILL Acts On Internal Investigation Concerning Excessive Force On Social Media Video. https://t.co/bFy4gYVAbB— SheriffVictorHill (@SheriffVHill) September 13, 2020Lastly, the press release added that despite the vicious nature of the police brutality, there were “no fractures detected” after Walker’s head was x-rayed.
