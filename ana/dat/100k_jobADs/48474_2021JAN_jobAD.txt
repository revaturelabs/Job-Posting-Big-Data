(B.C. government)B.C. Indigenous rights overhaul first job of 2020, John Horgan saysPremier speaks to Assembly of First Nations in Ottawa next weekTom FletcherNov. 29, 2019 12:00 p.m.BusinessGiving royal assent to B.C.’s latest batch of laws this week, Lt. Governor Janet Austin singled out one for special mention – the world’s first official adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.That’s unusual, and it is for good reason, Premier John Horgan told reporters after the fall session of the B.C. legislature adjourned.“It will transform how we do business in B.C. for the better,” Horgan said. “Unanimous support in the legislature, business interests around the province, in fact around the country, looking to B.C. as a leader in how we better make all of the people of British Columbia benefit from the extraordinary bounty we have here.”Work begins in January to start amending B.C. laws to meet the dozens of objectives of UNDRIP, and the first set of changes is expected in the spring session that begins in February, Horgan said.Premier @jjhorgan says @scottfraserndp begins work on #UNDRIP in January, after “200 years of colonial activity” #bcleg #bcpoli pic.twitter.com/5xsvoDNoqY— Tom Fletcher (@tomfletcherbc) November 29, 2019RELATED: B.C. environmental law overhauled to comply with UNDRIPRELATED: B.C. to transfer $100M from gambling to Indigenous people“I think the patience of Indigenous communities has been well demonstrated over the 200 years of colonial activity here in B.C. and across Canada,” Horgan said. “I’ve been invited to speak to the Assembly of First Nations in Ottawa next week about what we’ve been able to accomplish here, and I’m sure I’ll get some advice from elders and others about how we proceed in the new year.”Horgan praised the B.C. Liberal and Green Parties for joining his government’s support for the change, after detailed questioning of its implications over the past two weeks.“I want to ensure that the public understand that this is not just the NDP who’s doing this,” Horgan said.B.C. Liberal MLA Mike de Jong, a former minister of finance, Indigenous relations and justice, led the opposition questioning on Bill 41, described as a “framework” bill committing the province to dozens of clauses in the UN document.De Jong asked about UNDRIP Article 39, which states: “Indigenous peoples have the right to have access to financial and technical assistance from states and through international cooperation, for the enjoyment of rights contained in this declaration.”Indigenous Relations Minister Scott Fraser said UNDRIP “does not create a positive obligation on the part of the state, but there will be conversations about funding from the provincial government.”B.C. has already signed an agreement to share seven per cent of B.C. Lottery Corporation net income, which the province estimates will amount to $100 million over the 23-year term of the deal.Environment Minister George Heyman has completed a rewrite of B.C.’s Environment Assessment Act, after a consultation tour including mining, forest industry and union representatives.@tomfletcherbctfletcher@blackpress.caLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.BC legislatureGet local stories you won't find anywhere else right to your inbox.Sign up herePrevious storyAmazon pulls Auschwitz ‘Christmas ornaments’ after protestNext storyB.C. craft cannabis growers wind through layers of governmentJust Posted‘We’re still in it’: Wet’suwet’en push forward on rights recognitionThe 670-km Coastal GasLink pipeline was approved by B.C. and 20 elected First Nations councils on its pathEmployers might be able to require COVID-19 vaccination from employees: B.C. lawyer‘An employer must make the case’ using expert science, explains lawyer David MardirosCOVID-19 outbreak at Coastal GasLink worksites declared overIn total, 56 cases were associated with the outbreak in the Burns Lake and Nechako LHAsHaida activist calls for hefty fines, jail time against those who claim to be IndigenousFilmmaker Tamara Bell proposing the Indigenous Identity Act – to dissuade ‘Indigenous identity theft’Kitimat RCMP searching for man wanted on several warrants province-wideJones is described as a five-foot 10-inches Caucasian man, with blond hair and blue eyes.QUIZ: How much do you know about hockey?Test your knowledge of Canada’s national winter sportDrug users at greater risk of dying as services scale back in second wave of COVID-19It pins the blame largely on a lack of supports, a corrupted drug supplyTop doctor urges Canadians to keep up with COVID measures, even as vaccines roll outMore than 776,606 vaccines have been administered so farB.C.
