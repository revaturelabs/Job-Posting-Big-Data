Instead, the following NODES permit should be used:TSS PERMIT(userid) NODES(*.USERJ.userid) ACCESS(READ)Replace 'userid' in 2 places with the actual name of the userid that has PROPCNTL. This will result in the job failing with DRC007, which is what happens on a local job. This suggestion is based on the RACF instructions for the same situation, although, of course, the actual steps being recommended are somewhat different because of different internals between the 2 products.Additional Information:Please see the CA Top Secret Command Functions Guide for more information on PROPCNTL.EnvironmentRelease: TOPSEC00200-15-Top Secret-SecurityComponent:Feedbackthumb_up Yesthumb_down NoPowered by"
