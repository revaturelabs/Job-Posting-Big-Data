Photo by Brian Kent/Vancouver SunÂI was lucky enough this fall to be invited to observe two people receiving cochlear implants. I felt some of their excitement and nervousness and was duly impressed with the state of medical science that allows such a complex procedure. But I was also struck by the joy experienced by the audiologists who help patients learn to hear again.DistroscaleOften not right away, however. The first sounds heard through the device can be shocking and overwhelming.Cindy Gustin, head of B.C.’s adult cochlear implant program at St. Paul’s Hospital in Vancouver, tells patients that it’s like walking from a darkened room into intense sunlight, uncomfortable at first.“Whatever you’re hearing now, I guarantee you it will get better. I promise,” she tells them.Patients wince and sometimes want it turned off when they heard loud, unfamiliar sounds. It can take months or years for them to learn to use it to its full advantage. Yet most people do get there over time.Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Audiologist Sipke Pijl worked with the first cochlear implant patients in Canada in the early ’80s at St. Paul’s and seemed like an old friend to them at a reunion of recipients held there in late October. Despite the poor sound quality of the early implants (and I get a kick out of photos of the equipment he used at the time, with all the knobs and dials), it still gave people a way to connect to the hearing world.“To hear any sound make people less isolated,” he said. “One patient told me, ‘When I take it off, my head feels dead and when I put it on, I feel alive,” said Pijl.Gustin used to work with children and worried whether moving to the adult program would be less rewarding. Not so. Children using a cochlear implant will experience enhanced hearing for the first time.“Here, were giving people back their lives,” said Gustin.See the full storyhere and a photo essay by Ward Perrin documenting the process from surgery to cochlear implant activation here.
