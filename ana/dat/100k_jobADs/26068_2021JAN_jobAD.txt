As a result, two young people will shortly begin work at Preston and a further nine will begin apprenticeship training in September 2014 at Submarines.The employer-led Movement to Work scheme was begun by the Government and the Prince’s Trust and aims to help long-term unemployed young people into jobs. Under Movement to Work, young people complete a four-week training programme including a two-week work placement provided by employers. The programme aims to involve 100,000 young people across the UK by the end of 2015 and BAE Systems is offering 100 work experience places across its UK sites through Movement to Work in 2014 with a further 100 in 2015.Katy Evans who worked in the Finance Services Team at Preston said: “Getting work experience in a busy, complex environment such as the Finance Services office in Preston is invaluable when you are seeking your first job, which is surprisingly hard to find.”Catherine Robinson, HR Manager for Shared Services added: “I am so proud that our teams in Preston were the first within BAE Systems to take part in this scheme, providing advice plus vital hands-on practical experience. I am particularly delighted that at the end of the programme BAE Systems has been able to offer temporary positions to four of the young people within our Shared Services organisation, with the possibility of another two positions coming up shortly. In addition, one person has now secured an apprenticeship with his local county council and another has obtained a place at college.”At Barrow Jonathan Hughes, 23, had previously applied for an apprenticeship with BAE Systems but failed at the interview stage because he was unable to talk about specific projects he’d worked on. Jonathan said: “I’ve applied four times and it’s been frustrating because I’ve never been able to talk about a project I’ve worked on before.“The best thing about the placement is we weren’t treated like kids. We were given a job, taught how to do it then left to get on with it – like you would in the workplace. This has definitely helped me. I’ve logged everything I’ve done and have a better understanding of the business now, so I feel optimistic.”And Ted Creighton, Head of Learning and Development at BAE Systems Submarines, said: “We are pleased to be part of the Movement to Work initiative and I’m delighted that at the end of the programme, we were able to offer Jonathan and eight others a place on our apprenticeship scheme, starting in September.“There has been a fantastic response to the initiative and every single participant seemed to get a lot out of their time within the business. They all impressed their mentors with their positive, can-do attitudes and got stuck in, picking up important skills and practices that you’d only get in the working environment.To find out more about Movement to Work see http://www.movementtowork.com/Movement to woekRSSPrintContactKate Watcham Head of Media UK Head OfficeManages UK media activity+44 (0) 7793 420731ContactContactKate Watcham Head of Media UK Head OfficeManages UK media activity+44 (0) 7793 420731ContactTwitterLatest updatesAccessibilityTerms & ConditionsPrivacyCookie policySitemapCookie SettingsCopyright © 2021 BAE Systems.
