Passport, hard copy of B.A. diploma, a resume -- even if there is nothing on it relevant to teaching ESL? All these things, other stuff as well?Also, for Bogota, will a cashmere top coat sometimes be appropriate for the weather?Back to topLaLaDivinaJoined: 21 Dec 2013Posts: 33Location: ColombiaPosted: Sat Nov 08, 2014 3:12 am Post subject:I'm wondering this as well. I think there is a thread somewhere, perhaps in the general forum, about what documents you should bring. I would think a resume is required whether or not you have teaching experience. Did you complete your CELTA or TEFL yet? If you have, that should be on there.Back to topleretif9Joined: 24 Mar 2013Posts: 152Posted: Sat Nov 08, 2014 7:24 am Post subject:The resume: what if you've been out of work for a while? Like, a long while? There has been sustained mass unemployment in the US since the financial collapse of 2008.What do employers want to see on a resume?Back to topLaLaDivinaJoined: 21 Dec 2013Posts: 33Location: ColombiaPosted: Sun Nov 09, 2014 11:00 pm Post subject:Remember, in Colombia they use a CV, not a standard American resume. Even if you haven't worked in a while I would still suggest you create you resume in CV form with the dates and names of your employers, job title and one or two sentences outlining your job function(s). You should also be listing your education, certificates, awards, etc, not to mention your objective, which in this case I would assume is to be an English teacher. I'm not sure how old you are but I imagine you have some type of work history you can add.Back to topallencraigJoined: 16 Dec 2014Posts: 5Posted: Tue Jan 06, 2015 4:56 am Post subject:A CV IS a resume. Same thing, only in Colombia they like to see a small headshot photo on the CV.An ESL interview is just like any other interview, only specific to teaching English. Think about what information might come up and bring anything that may support what you imagine will be discussed or will be asked for. A coupla sheets of paper that you end up not needing isn't a problem.Back to topBakerStreetSaxSoloJoined: 28 Dec 2012Posts: 7Location: Bogota, ColombiaPosted: Mon Jan 12, 2015 4:22 am Post subject:Colombia really isn't as formal as the US when it comes to job interviews (or many things). For some places the interview will be a formality, as they'll see a foreigner with an English degree as a potential star employee, so just be polite and enthusiastic. For better jobs obviously the standards are higher but don't sweat it, basically.Back to topDisplay posts from previous: All Posts1 Day7 Days2 Weeks1 Month3 Months6 Months1 Year Oldest FirstNewest FirstJob Discussion Forums Forum Index -> Colombia All times are GMTPage 1 of 1Jump to: Select a forum Where to Begin----------------General DiscussionNewbie ForumCurrent Events ForumTechnology ForumOnline Teaching Forum Africa Forums----------------General Africa Forum Asia Forums----------------CambodiaChina (Job-related Posts Only)China (Off-Topic)Hong KongIndiaIndonesiaJapanMalaysiaPhilippinesSingaporeTaiwanThailandGeneral Asia ForumVietnam Caribbean Forums----------------General Caribbean Forum Europe Forums----------------Czech RepublicFranceGermanyGreeceItalyMacedonia and the BalkansPolandRomaniaRussia & C.I.S.SpainTurkeyUkraineUnited KingdomGeneral Europe Forum Latin America Forums----------------ArgentinaBrazilChileColombiaCosta RicaMexicoMexico (off-topic)PeruGeneral Latin America Forum The Middle East Forums----------------BahrainEgyptIsraelKuwaitOmanQatarSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesGeneral Middle East Forum North America Forums----------------General North America Forum Oceania----------------Australia/New ZealandYou cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forumThis page is maintained by the one and only Dave Sperling.Contact Dave's ESL CafeCopyright © 2018 Dave Sperling.
