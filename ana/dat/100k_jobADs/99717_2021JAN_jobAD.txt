Many other KPs who are either on the panel or have some influence over the appraisal will also be working closely with the officer, like committee heads and 2ICs, HOD/CCA, IP head for officer's CS2, other KPs in the officer's department(s), KPs in charge of special projects, etc etc.If you shine, you shine. Unless the whole school is conspiring against you, in which case it is time to seek a change in environment and a fresh start.You must remember who chairs the ranking board?If the RO is not on good terms with the officer, other who wished to fight for higher ranking for their subordinates will not face any objection from the RO.Also, when the P recommends a certain grade for the officer, who dares to stand forward to object?As long as the RO wants his/her JH to get lower ranking, it can be done. The rest of the KPs will not voice out because they want their own JH to rank higher. What is writing a report to a RO who wants to eliminate his/her JH?Unregistered 27-11-2020 10:13 PMQuote:Originally Posted by Unregistered (Post 150028)I got my GEO 5 (then GEO 1A3) at the age of 33.

This especially if newly minted geo5 officers join the pool.On a related note, there are even vps who step down to become HOT again...Don’t know if they’re seo1 or geo5 pay grade; then again it seems the same anxiety shows up in a more intense form given their above average background. Perhaps because seo1 could be ranking intra-cluster versus intra-school...?Would think the general advice for the real HOTs is to keep an arms length from these voluntary down-graders in terms of being in their team. Won’t be surprised if more work cascades down to justify their longer yis at that sub-grade, relatively higher pay at the ceiling, and existential need to remain competitive in the ranking pool.Just a 2 cents worth.Unregistered 28-11-2020 01:14 PMQuote:Originally Posted by Unregistered (Post 150076)Why did u give up a higher salary appointment?I worked my ass off to get to a SH position (even given high CEP by the interview panel) and sent to MLS (HOD/KP), led to believe that I would be given the HOD post when the current holder retires the next year. However, the P stabbed me in the back and gave it to junior officer who was just geo 1A1. Suffered terrible pre & post natal depression as a result (guess God decided to give me a baby to replace the position )Realised that I did not work smart and no one is irreplaceable.. so not gonna make that same mistake again and decided to step down to focus on core duty of teaching and family.Unregistered 28-11-2020 06:32 PMApplaud you for your courage. I will definitely prioritise my family, a permanent setting in my life rather than a transient one (i.e. work) in my life.Used to hunker after leadership roles, but I realised all these leadership roles are just carrots dangled to entice young officers into doing **** work.So I figured, I will just be happy maxing out at geo 5, earning 7.7k.wont die of hunger and can still live comfortably.I reached geo 4 at age 31, male. 7 years in service. I guess considered average performed. Past 5 perf grades have been Bs C+ and CUnregistered 29-11-2020 01:07 AMQuote:Originally Posted by JustAnotherPrimaryTeacher (Post 149166)That will be true, going by your context. However, it is also impossible that every achievement is not recognised or that his calibre will not be shown. He may 'shine' less but he will still shine. RO does play a part but if an officer is getting C- or D, there are definitely good reasons for that because reports have to be written to justify the grade (same as A).So albeit human factors come into play. If you are a diamond, you will still shine eventually.I did not know in order for an officer to get C-, a report has to be written. Heard that it was still considered a good grade, and only a D needs a report.I supposed a RO needs to inform the officer of his performance grading during work review and give the officer a chance to improve; otherwise, it would be unethical for the RO to let the officer only know in Apr.Unregistered 29-11-2020 04:36 AMQuote:Originally Posted by Unregistered (Post 150030)How hard is it to get GEO5 by 33?I worked my ass off actually. headed a committee and subject in school (in the 1st year i led, I improved the results from 60% to 90%) organized cluster events and even headed a community of practice at cluster level. Got the school the Innergy award for one project that I led with one of the school VPsI did not work smart though.. focus too much on work and tasks.. don’t be like me — work smarterUnregistered 29-11-2020 12:03 PMPls don't say such things.
