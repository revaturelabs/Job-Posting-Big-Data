Previous project|Next project ?1 of 61 of 6Qianhai Shimao Financial CenterShenzhen, ChinaGensler’s winning design competition entry comprises a 150,000-square-meter, mixed-use highrise in the booming Qianhai special economic zone.? Aspiring to become not only a Shenzhen landmark but also a vital connection to nearby Hong Kong, the tower embraces the two distinct cultures while serving as a symbol of unity, with each of two volumes representing its own identity yet inextricably intertwined. The tower tapers and rotates, creating a striking image while exuding a structural soundness by dispersing powerful wind forces common in the area. The pedestrian-oriented complex will be its own self-sufficient core, housing retail, restaurants, gardens and a rooftop observation deck with magnificent views across the Pearl River Delta.ExpertiseArchitecture ?Developer ?Related ContentPublicationDesign Update: Shanghai...Inspired by Shanghai’s tradition of parks and...Gensler Research InstituteDesign PremiumCan we quantify architecture’s contribution to building...Dialogue issueDialogue 28: The Why and How of the New...Workplace Now Research: Balancing Acts In the Mix...Dialogue ArticleUnder the Hood: Office...The pressures that drive workplace change, especially...ProjectAVIC International...On a prime site in Chengdu, this mixed-use development...ShareTwitterFacebookLinkedInEmailContactGensler Fact SheetSite MapNewsletterDiversityTop of page© 2020 Gensler, All Rights Reserved Privacy Statement & Cookie Policy Transparency StatementPlease enable JavaScript to experience the full functionality of www.jobs63.com一本之道高清无码视频_韩国三级电影_香港三级韩国三级日本三级"
