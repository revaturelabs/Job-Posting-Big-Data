Its growth sustainability depends on people like you who can give her the final push to break free of the gravity of corruption and mediocracy thats restraining her.It is time. The Mother awaits.There are a hundred reasons why India won’t suit your career. Probably there are a thousand more if you take into consideration, the future of your family too, who have probably put down roots and adapted into a western way of life. Not to mention a million difficulties, irritations, insects, nags, stressful situations, health concerns and so on. The list, like our poverty stricken population can seem overwhelming.BUT not hopeless. The burdens can be lightened, difficulties – overcome. You will prevail. Like the future of India was bleak when she was born again, yet she rises today to hold her head straight and high, it is possible that you can come back to give back to our Mother some of your life’s strength. Not as a old man who comes back after exhausting all effort, energy, youth and scientific temper and knowledge in service of other Nations, but in time.We don’t promise you anything. Except perhaps, the smell of the soil after monsoon rains. Please come back.The Mother awaits.ReplyLeave a Reply to Jagan Mohan Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
