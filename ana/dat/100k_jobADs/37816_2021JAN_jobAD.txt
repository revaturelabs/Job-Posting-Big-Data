This was the first job interview in a long time and I was running late. Entering through the rusty doors I saw an elevator. I pressed the button and the elevator doors slowly creaked open. I hit the button for Main Lobby and the elevator started to drop down, down, down at a terrifying rate. I clutched the rail on the wall bracing for the inevitable crash. It screeched to a stop and the doors opened to total darkness except for all those glowing red eyes.
