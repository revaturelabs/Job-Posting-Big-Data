A tiered process can give communities initial training, progress to creating a downtown network and then onto becoming a designated Main Street.Why all of the emphasis on downtowns?Whether they are in large cities or small towns, downtown areas often account for 30 percent of jobs and up to 40 percent of the tax base of a community, Helmer said.Nurturing businesses to start or grow downtown, therefore, can become long-term successes.Working with entrepreneurs is one area Main Street Alabama helps communities, she said.“Entrepreneurs are passionate about what they do,” Helmer said. “In my experience, entrepreneurs almost never have business experience and they never have money.”Main Street can help those entrepreneurs in areas where they may be lacking so they can put the passion to work for themselves and their community, she said.Downtowns can’t usually count on major economic development projects like a Mercedes-Benz auto plant or an Airbus jet factory, but they can get the small businesses that can be just as vital, Helmer said.“We all like the homeruns,” she said. “But what really makes a community grow are the singles, the doubles and the triples.”February 27, 2014By Michael Tomberlin | mtomberlin@al.comSmall BusinessREV Birmingham Offering Small Business Workshops Throughout MarchStay connected to what's happening in Alabama now.Email*Enter your email address to receive periodic updates on the evolution of business in Alabama.Ready to start your company's next chapter in Alabama?Alabama may be small in size, but its ability to accommodate businesses seeking success is vast.
