This forecast is strengthened by other findings from the poll such as, 96 percent of employers worldwide concur that graduate business school hires create value for their companies.The annual Poll was conducted in late 2014, and provides an early look at hiring plans based on responses of 169 employers in 33 countries. The results serve as an early view into the 2015 job market for MBA, master of management, accounting, finance, and other specialized business master degree-holders.The greatest hiring demand for b-school talent remains recent MBA graduates, while the largest increase in hiring demand is projected to be for Master in Management talent, reflected in the eleven percentage point increase in firms who hired this category of graduates in 2014.Employers’ plans to hire newly-minted bachelors graduates are projected to be slightly lower in 2015 (78% planning to hire bachelor’s degree holders, compared with 82% that hired them in 2014).In addition, more than half of employers (54% to 74%) plan to increase starting annual base salaries at or above the rate of inflation in 2015 for new MBA and business master’s hires.“The solid job prospects for b-school talent seen over the past several years and again reflected in this poll, give prospective students good reason to consider pursuing these degrees as part of a strategy to drive their career goals,” said Rebecca Estrada Worthington, GMAC’s Survey Research Manager. “Our data show that even in the depths of the recession, business and management degrees can provide a measure of job protection and opportunity. Today, in a recovering global economy, management degrees can be a powerful driver of confidence and provide fuel for an individual’s career growth,” Estrada Worthington added.2015 RECRUITINGBusiness Schools looking to gain additional insights into the 2015 employment landscape for their management graduates can register to have their students and employers participate in upcoming Global Management Education Graduate Survey as well as the Corporate Recruiters Survey conducted in partnership with EFMD and the MBA Career Services and Employer Alliance.
