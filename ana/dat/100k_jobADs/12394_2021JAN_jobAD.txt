It also backed the creation of thousands of new affordable homes through long-term debt financing and its affordable housing arm. Its most recent housing commitment was agreed at the end of December 2020 in Bristol, where it secured consent to deliver 185 homes through modern methods of construction. The energy efficient scheme has been developed with Bristol City Council in Bonnington Walk, Lockleaze and will have half of its homes as dedicated affordable.

Through its investments in later living housing this year alone, Legal & General has created around £4.3 million of saving for the NHS each year, whilst freeing up thousands of hospital beds.
