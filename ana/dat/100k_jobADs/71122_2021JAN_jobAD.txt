Hiring usually grows before the holidays and falls after.AdvertisementThe number of Virginians still receiving traditional claims week after week stayed virtually flat at 63,588.The figures don’t account for Virginians in non-traditional employment, like gig work and independent contracting, that’s been covered by federal relief programs like Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation. Counting both of those programs, there was about 340,000 Virginians collecting some form of unemployment benefit during the week ending Dec. 26.AdvertisementNationwide, new unemployment claims during the week dropped by 3,000 to 787,000.
