On January 3, 2014, Fidelity National Financial acquired Lender Processing Services and renamed it to Black Knight Financial Services. On October 2, 2017, upon the completion of a distribution by Fidelity National Financial of its equity interest in Black Knight Financial Services, Inc., the company rebranded as simply Black Knight. The mortgage business segment of Fidelity National Information Services was spun off in 2008 to become a fully independent, publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol LPS Jeffery Carbiener, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Fidelity National Information Services at the time of the divide, became the first President and Chief Executive Officer of LPS. The 2010 robo-signing scandal exposed questionable behavior on the part of employees of a small subsidiary of the company. In addition to the federal government, states such as Nevada filed legal proceedings against these employees. The investigation of these business practices were featured in an episode of 60 Minutes. Eventually LPS settled with the federal government and other states and ceased operations of the problematic subsidiary. Some controversy surrounded the resignation of two attorneys who had investigated LPS as part of their work for Florida's Economic Crime Division, as they claimed to have resigned under pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi, who had received campaign contributions from LPS.Total Jobs:59Total Experts:5Average Pay:$125,760Total value of jobs:$17,355,000% Masters:28%Learn More About Black Knight Financial Technology Solutions LLC* Ladders EstimatesMore Jobs at Black Knight Financial Technology Solutions LLCAppraisal Modernization and Innovation Manager$100K — $150KBlack Knight Financial Technology Solutions LLC•Remote10 days ago.NET Development Manager$150K — $200KBlack Knight Financial Technology Solutions LLC•Denver, CO 8021410 days agoServicing Digital Integration Consultant$80K — $100KBlack Knight Financial Technology Solutions LLC•Jacksonville, FL 3209910 days ago.NET Developer III (Remote)$100K — $150KBlack Knight Financial Technology Solutions LLC•Jacksonville, FL 3209910 days agoProduct Manager III$150K — $200KBlack Knight Financial Technology Solutions LLC•Jacksonville, FL 3209910 days agoSimilar JobsProduct Support Supervisor$80K — $100KBlack Knight Financial Technology Solutions LLC•Overland Park, KS 6622410 days agoProduct Support Supervisor$80K — $100KThe Home Depot•Austin, TX 7870117 days agoProduct Support Supervisor- Technology Operations Command Center$80K — $100KThe Home Depot•Atlanta, GA 3030317 days agoProduct Support Engineer$80K — $100KImpervia•Plano, TX 750234 days agoProduction Support Engineer$80K — $100KPayPal•Omaha, NE 681014 days agoMore Enterprise Technology JobsPrincipal Software Engineer - C#, .NET, WPFConfidential Company•Remote2 days agoSenior Software Engineer - C#, .NET, WPFConfidential Company•Remote2 days agoSenior DevOps Engineer - SaaS, Cloud, Java, DockerConfidential Company•Austin, TX 787412 days agoChannel Sales Rep - iPaaS Software (Alliances, OEM's VAR's)$150K — $170K + no cap, equityCube Management•South San Francisco, CA 940803 days agoSenior Accountant - Accounting Policies / SEC$110K — $120K + $25K bonus + all benefitsNew York, NY 100013 days agoFind similar product support supervisor jobs:NationwideOverland Park, KSNews & Career AdviceJob SearchThese are the 5 college majors that will make you a top earner for lifeCW HeadleyThese people will get hired in 2021Kyle Schnitzer4 digital tools that will help you stand out to recruitersBella WananaLegal Privacy Press & Media Work at LaddersHighest-Paying Jobs Highest-Paying Companies Highest-Paying Careers Highest-Paying Industries Cities & States Expert Network News & Career Advice DirectoryFAQs Member Help Recruiter Help Contact Us Unsubscribe© Ladders, Inc.Legal | Privacy | Press & Media | Work at LaddersHighest-Paying Jobs | Highest-Paying Companies | Highest-Paying Careers | Highest-Paying Industries | Cities & States | Expert Network | News & Career Advice DirectoryFAQs | Member Help | Recruiter Help | Contact Us | Unsubscribe© Ladders, Inc."
