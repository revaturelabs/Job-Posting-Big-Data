This means that you no longer have to use antiquated keyword search to find a job. You simply enter your skills and preferences, find perfectly matching jobs, explore career opportunities all the while remaining anonymous.In addition, PandoLogic is based on a network of thousands of partner sites from a variety of locations and industries. This means that you will receive a great variety of job matches from the locations and occupations of your choice.Q: How can I remain anonymous while looking for a job?A: PandoLogic does not ask you to submit your name, address or any other indentifying details. You can remain anonymous throughout your job matching process. The only time that you are required to identify yourself is when you apply to a job. Even then, your information is sent directly to the employer and not kept in your online account. Resumes can be kept confidential and not shown to employers. As a candidate, you can even specify which employers to exclude (ex: your current employer).Q: How can I get the best job matches?A: PandoLogic is using three elements to create a job match: your skills, your job preferences and the job requirements. To get the best result you need to add as many details to your profile and refine your preferences until you get exactly the type of jobs that you want and qualify for.Skills and preferences can be added in the “My Match Profile” tab. Every time you apply to a job the system will ask you about missing skills and allow you to add them to your profile to improve your matching. Since candidates are graded according to how well they qualify for the job, then candidates with more skills and employment history are more likely to be noticed by employers.Q: What does the match grading method mean?A: Job Matches are ranked according to: Great Matches, Good Matches or Basic Matches. Basic matches are jobs that simply belong to the job categories and locations that you selected. They match what you are looking for but not necessarily what the employer is looking for. Good and Great matches take into account your skills and employment history and how well you qualify for the job. The more details you add for skills, education, and work experience, the more likely you are to find Great Matches.Q: What is the “Improve Your Matchability” module?A: This is a unique module that asks you about your skills and preferences in order to help you improve your match level and see more jobs that you qualify for. Each time you answer a question, you are likely to see the number of job matches increases or at least improve in quality.Q: Why is adding job titles important?A: PandoLogic is unique in its ability to match you with a job based on specific job titles that you are interested in. You can add several job titles to your preferences and the system will give priority to jobs that have these exact job titles.Q: What do I do if I am unhappy with my job match results?A: Unsatisfactory matching can stem from several reasons:Your skills and preferences need refinement (additional details)There are not enough jobs that are of interest to youYou do not qualify for enough jobsAs a first step, try to add more skills to your profile and refine your preferences. If you still do not receive quality matches don’t worry. As soon as we have new good matches for you we will alert you via e-mail and invite you to look at such jobs.Q: Why is it important to upload a resume?A: While job posting is free on this site, employers pay to view your resume and contact you. An employer is not likely to open your profile and contact you if there is no resume attached to it.Q: What do I do if I forgot my password?A: click on the “Forgot Password” link below the login box and get a new one.Q: How do I stop getting notifications from my account?A: You do not need to delete your account from PandoLogic. You never know when you will need it to find you a job again and may want to be notifies again about new opportunities.
