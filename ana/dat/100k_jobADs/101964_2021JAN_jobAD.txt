It is the basic need of humans to have people around them that this poem stresses. To see the world slowly moving away from the value that others play in our lives is a very sad thing indeed. God made us for relationship and of utmost importance is our relationship with Him.For the cancer patient it is extremely important to recognize that he/she needs to have people who will come along side and be there for them. This is not a time to be alone. It is healthy to verbalize what you are feeling and talk about it with someone you can trust. I recognize that there may be times when you do not want to talk. And that's okay! There is always someone who is ready and willing to listen when you are ready. Just having people around that care is extremely helpful to your well being and ultimately your healing. Choose wisely and surround yourself with people who will encourage and support you in whatever you do.Posted at 06:13 PM in Cancer | Permalink | Comments (0)Reblog (0)CommentsYou can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post.The comments to this entry are closed.PagesA Cancer SurvivorAbout MeMy BookOtherQuotesCategoriesArticles (5)Cancer (46)Faith (13)Food and Drink (20)Health (61)Life (23)Pets (1)Rambling (6)Recipes (4)Travel (7)Weblogs (63)See MoreRecent PostsGod is Good!Be Encouraged!AloneDo No Harm..
