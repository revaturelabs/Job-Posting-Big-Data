This is opposed to forcing returners to undertake a course that can take between three and twelve months to complete.These proposed changes will make it ‘as straight forward and cost effective as possible for people with the right skills to join it’s register’, the NMC said.This announcement follows the release of a report by the Health Foundation, Kings Fynd and Nuffield trust, which found that the NHS will face a shortfall of 108,000 full-time equivalent nurses in ten years’ time, on current trends.Chief Executive and registrar at the NMC, Andrea Sutcliffe, has expressed that ‘by proposing a new way for even more people to get back to work after a break, and reducing the cost of the overseas test, we can enhance the numbers of professionals with the right skills coming onto our register. These are people we know are committed to providing the best and safest care possible.’Ms Sutcliffe hopes that both of these changes demonstrates that the NMC is playing a part in positively addressing the nursing and midwifery shortages that exist in health services across the UK.This announcement is fantastic news for overseas nurses wanting to work in the UK, and returning registered nurses alike.If you’re considering a move to the UK, get in touch with our specialist team here.Share this article on Twitter Share this article on Facebook Share this article on LinkedIn Shared this article on Google+ Forward this article by emailPost a commentForename: * Surname: * Email address: * Spam Prevention: *Comment: *You confirm that by submitting your personal data that you have read and understood our privacy notice.
