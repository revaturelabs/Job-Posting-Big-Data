His career has spanned professional yacht racing, tech start ups and ‘future of work’ consulting. Here, he picks the five things he couldn’t do his job without1 TrelloI love the flexibility of Trello as it can be a Kanban, a project plan, an ideas board or just a simple set of lists. Working with many tech businesses and projects, I find it particularly good at tracking complex, agile projects collaboratively and very visually. I often drive to work early, which is great thinking time. Using an IFTTT integration to link Trello to Google Assistant voice control means all those great ideas are captured and easily sorted when I get to my desk.2 -3D printersAs a high-tech engineering business, we are constantly wanting to test ideas. I love the fact that we can quickly CAD these up (we use SolidWorks) and within a few hours have a 3D-printed prototype in our hands. There is something magic about having a physical object in your hands and being able to offer it up to other components. It certainly helps make the creativity and problem-solving juices flow. We also have a full spec CNC unit with 5 axis milling machines running at £100,000 plus each, so we can get the final pieces machined and in production quickly too.Standing desk3 A standing deskI haven’t sat down at work for almost a decade – I’m absolutely certain it keeps me fitter, sharper and more productive. It certainly encourages me to move around more, helping with energy levels and better posture.Interestingly, it’s also contagious. When I started at Parajet I was the only one standing. Now, I’d say 80% of the team are at standing desks and they love it too. We have the type that can be lowered if need be, but most people opt to keep them raised.4 Parajet Maverick ParamotorA bit like a company car scheme, we really do have a fly-to-work scheme at Parajet. Here, staff can buy discounted gear, paid for monthly via salary sacrifice. Over half our team are on the scheme. For me it’s actually faster to fly to work from a field near my home than to drive, and in the summer months there is no better way to put a grin on one’s face at the start of the day.5 LoomWhen I was a professional yacht skipper, I realised that constant briefings were essential to get everyone on the same page. Now, with a worldwide dealer and supply network, the ability to record asynchronous presentations, sharing data and pictures, but with the human touch of the team actually seeing me is a real boon. Loom makes this easy and quick.To find out more about Parajet and learning to paramotor, visit:www.parajet.comPlease follow and like us:Post Views: 79Published in News3D printersA standing deskLoomParajet Maverick ParamotorSimon Walker is Managing Director of ParajetTrelloEditorial ContentMore from NewsMore posts in News »Dataworkout launches its first film: the quest for super intelligenceDataworkout launches its first film: the quest for super intelligenceHow COVID-19 has changed the UK retail landscapeHow COVID-19 has changed the UK retail landscapeThe Earth’s atmosphere has been modelled in Microsoft Azure as part of a project to tackle climate change caused by aviation, reports MicrosoftThe Earth’s atmosphere has been modelled in Microsoft Azure as part of a project to tackle climate change caused by aviation, reports MicrosoftUniversity Print Shop accelerates growth with Konica Minolta’s AccurioPress C3080University Print Shop accelerates growth with Konica Minolta’s AccurioPress C3080A sign of the digital times…..A sign of the digital times…..Latest Magazine IssuesRead the latest issue of Managed.IT magazine online now (Issue V59)Read the latest issue of Managed.IT magazine online now (Issue V59)Read our latest issue of Managed.IT magazine issue 58Read our latest issue of Managed.IT magazine issue 58Read our latest issue of Managed.IT magazine issue 57Read our latest issue of Managed.IT magazine issue 57Managed.IT Magazine Issue 56 Read online now, or downloadManaged.IT Magazine Issue 56 Read online now, or downloadManaged.IT Magazine Issue 55 Read online now, or downloadManaged.IT Magazine Issue 55 Read online now, or downloadInnovationsKodak Alaris offers free one-year Capture Pro Software subscriptionKodak Alaris offers free one-year Capture Pro Software subscriptionRISO introduces new ComColor FT rangeRISO introduces new ComColor FT rangeViewSonic’s On-the-Go Second Display TD1655, named as CES 2021 Innovation Awards HonoreViewSonic’s On-the-Go Second Display TD1655, named as CES 2021 Innovation Awards HonoreCharge everything at once..and on one device!!Charge everything at once..and on one device!!Rugged mobile LiFi power at your fingertips from GetacRugged mobile LiFi power at your fingertips from GetacProductivity at your fingertips with the portable, 10-point touch-sensitive USB-C display 16T2Productivity at your fingertips with the portable, 10-point touch-sensitive USB-C display 16T2RS Components introduces Safe Distancing Assistant from Pathfindr to help people maintain safe social distancingRS Components introduces Safe Distancing Assistant from Pathfindr to help people maintain safe social distancingPerfect for Sync-ing those Teams meetingsPerfect for Sync-ing those Teams meetingsTrack and trace wearables…Track and trace wearables…Surface Hub goes large with an expanding family…..Surface Hub goes large with an expanding family…..Latest PostsDataworkout launches its first film: the quest for super intelligenceDataworkout launches its first film: the quest for super intelligenceJanuary 23, 2021How COVID-19 has changed the UK retail landscapeHow COVID-19 has changed the UK retail landscapeJanuary 22, 2021The Earth’s atmosphere has been modelled in Microsoft Azure as part of a project to tackle climate change caused by aviation, reports MicrosoftThe Earth’s atmosphere has been modelled in Microsoft Azure as part of a project to tackle climate change caused by aviation, reports MicrosoftJanuary 21, 2021Tweets by ManagedITMagThe Managed Tech Services Magazine & News Site for B2B UK IT Directors, IT Managers & Tech Buyers: Featuring ICT, Print, IP-Comms, Cloud, Software, AV & Security2020This site uses cookies More infoNo problem"
