There is a chimney opening that goes up 2 floors, through other people's flats and out the roof chimney. We are on the ground floor in a large Victorian house that has been divided into flats. The fireplace opening is probably the original one. However, we don't know if the current black flue goes all the way through the roof.The Aga is a gas Aga, so gas is already running to that space.Any information you can give will be greatly appreciated. Once we are sure we can go ahead with the plan and will ask for quotes for the installation.Thanks.Asked by Linda on 26th Jan 2020Share this questionJb renovation\"Hi, you will need to fit a new flue to suit the new cooker for its regulations and safety.\"Answered on 27th Jan 2020 - Member since Jul 2019 - reportWas this answer helpful? 1Ck plumbing and maintenance\"You would probably require the chimney lining.
