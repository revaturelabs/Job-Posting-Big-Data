"The benefits of using miniature remote controlled underwater vehicles for survey and inspection - Offshore Oil & Gas Exploration, Drilling, Construction, Fabrication & ProductionThe benefits of using miniature remote controlled underwater vehicles for survey and inspection	Local authorities, insurance companies or anyone that has had to hire in teams of professional divers to Inspecting underwater structures, sea protection barriers and water tanks, know only to well it can be a very costly business indeed. These modern days of health and safety awareness bring many problems associated with working underwater in poor conditions and with it the extra costs involved. Breathing compressed air in water has time limiting restrictions for divers and depending on the depths the diver has to work, the danger of air bubbles becoming trapped in their blood stream increase. Professional divers therefore have to stick stringently to following dive tables or dive depth computers that limit the amount of time that they can spend working underwater.It is now possible to carry out underwater inspection while at the same time removing the time constraints that divers have when working underwater buy using a small remote control vehicle fitted with video, powerful lights and a camera on board. Videoray ROV can provide clear colour images in real time to the pilot on the surface and makes inspection and underwater surveys safer and more cost effective. For underwater inspections, the Videoray can be equipped with a high-resolution camera, wide-angle lens and sonar. Since Videoray weighs only eight pounds, and is highly maneuverable it can easily fit into smaller areas than a diver could, such as pipes, drains, hulls and in between structures.The images are clear and in colour and will show damage, corrosion, defects and underwater structural problems up-close. In order to control future damage and to prove that regular inspections have taken place, video footage of the inspection can be kept on record for future examination. If there is extensive damage to an underwater structure, identification is usually quicker and if necessary divers can be called in to carry out repairs in a shorter time period. Future inspections can be conducted to prove that the necessary repairs have been made to meet all current safety standards. This is particularly important when it comes to public places or structures used by people on a daily basis.May 13, 2015 Dave_McBrideExploring the World of Oil and Gas - Possible CareersLearn Oilfield Jobs At Oil Rig SchoolYou Might Also LikePETRONAS STARTS PRODUCTION FROM BLOCK 5A IN SUDANPETRONAS AND PROTON TO EXPLORE USE OF PETRONAS ENGINE, NGV SYSTEM FOR PROTON’S CARSComments: 3?????? ??????3 years ago?????? ??????! http://wson.de/?url=https://vam-groshi.com.ua/&info=1ReplyCancelNazirul2 years agoSaya nak bekerja,ReplyCancelMuhammad Husaini1 year agoAlso, when there are interviews on oil & gas plant interviewsReplyCancelLeave a Reply to ?????? ??????
