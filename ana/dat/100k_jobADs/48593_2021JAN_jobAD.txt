I go for things like dumbbells, kettlebells, and lots of bodyweight options. I feel like this makes fitness more accessible to people who may not have access to a huge gym with every possible piece of equipment. Exercise can be done anywhere and you can make it as hard or as easy as you want!I came up with the following bodyweight workout, but I also provided some modifications to make the moves easier or harder. As written, it’s a 30 minute workout, but feel free to add or subtract how many times you go through it if you need to modify the time. Enjoy!Intermediate Bodyweight Circuit WorkoutPerform each movement for 45 seconds, followed by 15 seconds of rest. Move to the next movement and repeat, cycling through the circuit 5 times for a total of 30 minutes.Box jumpsTricep dipsPlank shoulder tapsCurtsy lungesBurpeesPush upsBox JumpsThis can be performed on a bench, box, or stable raised surface. Start with feet a couple inches behind the box, squat slightly with your weight in your heels, then jump to reach the top of the box, making sure that both feet are entirely on the box.Land softly in a quarter squat, and make sure to stand up completely to extend the hips before stepping down.Modifications:Easier: shorter box or do step upsHarder: increase the height of the boxTricep dipsUsing a bench or chair, place hands on the outside of hips, fingers pointing forwards. Slowly lower your upper body down, making sure that your back is as close to the bench as possible (think about going straight down vs out at an angle which can place stress on your shoulders). Lower until arms are at 90 degrees, then use triceps to push yourself back up to starting.Modifications:Easier: Keep legs bent at 90 degreesHarder: straighten your legs or try only keeping one leg on the ground at a timePlank shoulder tapsStart in a high plank with your hands directly underneath your shoulders and back flat with core engaged (no back arch). Widen your feet to help with stability as you lift one hand off the ground and tap the opposite shoulder, then do the opposite side. Try to limit the amount of rocking back and forth when shifting your weight from side to side by maintaining a tight core.Modifications:Easier: Take out the shoulder taps and hold a plankCurtsy lungesWith one leg, take a step back diagonally (resembling a curtsy) and lunge down to touch your knee to the floor. Make sure that you step back far enough so that your front knee stays behind your front toe. You should feel like you are shifting your weight into your back leg as you lunge down. Repeat on the other side.Imagine your hip bones are two headlights and they should point forwards at all times. Do not rotate your whole upper body as you step back diagonally.Modifications:Easier: perform a shallower lunge (don’t go all the way to the floor)BurpeesStart standing, jump down into a plank and then quickly lower yourself to the floor. Push yourself up from the floor, jump your feet towards your hands as you stand up, finishing the move with another standing jump at the top.Modifications:Easier: jump back into a high plank and don’t lower yourself all the way down or even step back into a high plank rather than jumpPush-upsStarting in a high plank with a flat back, lower your chest to the floor by bending your arms and sending them back at a 45 degree angle (think back at an angle and not straight out from the sides). Keep your neck in a neutral position, meaning it hang down towards the floor. Think about looking a few inches in front of you on the floor as you lower. Press everything back up in a straight line, breathing out as you lift.Modifications:Easier: Perform push-ups on your knees, making sure that your entire body is in a rigid line as you lower yourself to the floor. Tuck your butt as you lower.fitness workout	Previous Post | Next Post3 comments on “Intermediate Bodyweight Workout”	Rosey Rebecca says:	October 10, 2018 at 11:37 amLove this workout- although the burpees are making me cringe. haha Thanks!Rosey Rebecca recently posted…The Frantic Fantastic Flea Fiasco of 2018™ReplyKaitlyn McQuin says:	October 11, 2018 at 1:08 pmDEM MUSCLES, THO.

This will definitely get your heart rate up. If someone didn’t have a box for box jumps I’d substitute the movement with a cardio exercise like jumping jacks or high knees.Keeon recently posted…Survival Advice From 10 Fitness Experts For The holidaysReplyLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
