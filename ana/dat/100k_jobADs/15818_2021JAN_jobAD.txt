Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”Written By Steve Jobs	| Tagged The misfits, The rebels, The troublemakers	| Leave a commentPost navigationSearch A QuoteSearchSearch By Writers…Abraham Lincoln Albert Einstein Anonymous Anuj Somany Anusha Goenka A P J Abdul Kalam Aristotle Arnold H.
