Thanks to his vision, diversity became a part of our value system.Today, we have one of the most diverse workforces in the world. Through diversity of backgrounds and perspectives, we gain the benefit of different ways of looking at our business, leading to innovative breakthroughs for our customers and more engaging work for our people.And we continue to learn and adapt every day.
