It is not required to do the whole web, only the template page.The design must be as similar as possible to the attached image:- Side menu that shows by default only the mother pages (pages), the children (subpages) will be seen only when clicking.- The side menu will be fixed, it will not scroll when scrolling on the screen. Only the content will scroll. If the menu options are too many to appear with the fixed menu, the menu will scroll, but independent of the content section.As seen in the attached image.- Although it is not necessary for the design to be exactly like the image, it must be clear and clean. I have tried with Wordpress menu plugins and they are not clear and with good design.- It must be responsive, and the menu must work on tablets and mobilesThank you.Category: IT & ProgrammingSubcategory: WordpressWhat is the scope of the project?: Custom developmentIs this a project or a position?: ProjectI currently have: I have specificationsRequired availability: As neededPublished by: V.
