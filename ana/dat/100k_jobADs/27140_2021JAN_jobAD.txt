Design: A cross-sectional design was used to collect data from a sample of 207 nurses working in a public hospital in Muscat, Oman. Methods: An electronic survey was used to assess nurses’ perceptions of work environment, burnout, job satisfaction, turnover intention, and quality of care. Findings: Participation in hospital affairs, a foundation for quality of care, and staffing adequacy were predictors of burnout among nurses and perceived quality of care. Logistic regression analysis revealed that working in a favorable environment was associated with less turnover intention, but only when job satisfaction was high. Conclusions: Improving nurse job satisfaction is a mechanism through which future interventions could enhance working conditions and promote better nurse retention. Clinical Relevance: Organizational strategies are needed to increase nurse job satisfaction by empowering nurses to take more active roles in hospital affairs as a strategy to reduce turnover intention and enhance the quality of patient care.Original languageEnglishPages (from-to)95-104Number of pages10JournalJournal of Nursing ScholarshipVolume52Issue number1DOIshttps://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12528Publication statusPublished - Jan 1 2020KeywordsBurnouthealthcare qualityjob satisfactionturnover intentionwork environmentASJC Scopus subject areasNursing(all)Access to Document10.1111/jnu.12528Link to publication in ScopusLink to the citations in ScopusFingerprint Dive into the research topics of 'Nursing Work Environment, Turnover Intention, Job Burnout, and Quality of Care: The Moderating Role of Job Satisfaction'.
