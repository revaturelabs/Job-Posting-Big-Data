May 2015RELATED POSTSHad a walk alone i Copenhagen Zoo today on assignment for a client. The Zoo have been closed for some time now due to coronavirus, and have just been given funds from the government to help keep the animals alive which is why I was there. During my walk around it struck me that the animals were completely different from when you visit normally. From the smallest critters to the large bears every single animal just longed for interaction and came as close as they could investigating me- so I spent an extra hour there just enjoying our small but important time together. (note before any Zoo haters out there start bashing on Copenhagen Zoo, there were plenty of staff there taking good care of the animals….and me).8. April 2020Home. #vestjylland15.
