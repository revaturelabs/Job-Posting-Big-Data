Did you then join Jobs at Apple?33 ReactionsChrisJuly 10, 2018 at 7:57 PMThanks, wxwax. I've always wondered if Steve's interaction with General Magic influenced him at Apple. Maybe Tony or Andy would know.I helped my young sons start SmugMug, thinking the most important thing I could do in life was to help them achieve their dreams, and then Apple called me several times to see if I was interested in running MobileMe. It wasn't Steve or an offer, just an opportunity to interview.When I declined, another group called to see if they could acquire SmugMug. We had a couple of really good meetings but in the end we wanted to keep it as a family company.6119 Reactions"
