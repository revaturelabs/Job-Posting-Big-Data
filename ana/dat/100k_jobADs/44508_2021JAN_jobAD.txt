Final deadline for the first round is 9:00 pm AEST April 10, 2013 (7:00 am PST, April 9, 2013).Tourism Australia Managing Director Andrew McEvoy said the competition provided an excellent platform to entice more young people from around the world to come to Australia to holiday and work.“We’ve taken one of the most successful tourism campaigns in recent times – “Best Job in the World” – and made it bigger and better by coming up with a competition which represents the very best of our country – our breath-taking landscapes and scenery, our unique nature and wildlife, great food and wine and, of course, our huge sense of fun,” Mr McEvoy said.Ben Southall added: “A few years ago I won “The Best Job in the World” – being an Island Caretaker on the Great Barrier Reef. Unfortunately for me, my time is up. But luckily for the world ‘The Best Job in the World’ is back. This time there’s not one, but six amazing jobs in Australia up for grabs.”Jane Whitehead, Tourism Australia Vice President, Americas added that the competition was expected to appeal to youth travellers’ sense of fun and adventure and also those seeking a gap year and international experience.“Australia, with its quality of living, wage levels and job opportunities offers attractive options for those that want to strengthen and round out their resumes while having the time of their life experiencing a beautiful and dynamic country.”For those who are interested in exploring work and travel opportunities beyond the competition jobs, Tourism Australia has secured industry partners to support the campaign and help make it easier for young travellers to find jobs and make travel arrangements.Virgin Australia and STA Travel are providing travel deals and travel options. For job opportunities, recruiter Monster.com has created an online ‘jobs board’, advertising temporary jobs within the Australian tourism industry that are suitable for travellers visiting the country on a Working Holiday or Work and Holiday Visa.Other partners supporting the campaign include Citibank, DELL, IKEA, and Sony Music.The youth segment contributes A$12 billion annually in total tourism spending and delivers nearly 1.6 million (26%) of Australia’s international arrivals. In 2012, Working Holiday Makers contributed A$2.5 billion to the Australian economy.For further details of the campaign and competition visit Tourism Australia’s Working Holidays Facebook page, www.facebook.com/australianworkingholiday or www.australia.com/bestjobsTwitter: www.twitter.com/TourismAusSOURCE: Tourism AustraliaShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...RelatedThis entry was posted in: NewsTagged with: Australia, Best Job in the World, Great Barrier Reef, Tourism, Tourism Australia, Tourism Queensland, Working Holiday Makerby TravelBloggers.caTravel, Vacation & Holiday Blog Focusing on Tourism and Photography1 Comment	Pingback: Winners Unveiled For Australia’s ‘Best Jobs In The World’ | TravelBloggers.caWe welcome and value all comments, but due to the bombardment of spam we request that you comment via our 'Contact' page.
