Not shockingly, my most popular private workshop for girls’ nights in, bachelorette parties, etc, is my Suck on This: Adventures in Fellatio workshop. Why? Because people talk about these types of workshops, because some companies offer them en masse, and because people don’t realize you can have just as fun of an evening with a cunnilingus (oral sex on a woman) or anal sex class.However, my blow job workshops, here in the beautiful state of Colorado, are more unique than they are run of the mill (but really, are blow job classes really ever run of the mill??). Yes, we all get to practice and dildos and/or zucchinis (with flavored condoms) to really nail down the tricks and techniques discussed. That is not all though – we talk about anatomy, we talk about how to get yourself off (or at least stimulated) while giving a blow job, how to converse with your partners about blow jobs, oral action, and really, sexuality in general. Plus, everyone at my fellatio workshops gets lube to take home, and the host/hostess gets a little extra present as a thank you for setting them up.All of my workshops are on a sliding scale, and I ask people to pay what they can afford. I can teach to groups as small as 4 or 5, or as big as 20 plus, in the comfort of your own home, your friend’s home, or even a private room at a bar, community center, etc. Also, unlike many companies that put on blow job classes with a rule that it is for women only, my sexuality workshops (all of them, not just fellatio) are open to people of all genders and all orientations.Interested in booking a blow job party? Or one of my other sexuality workshops? Whether you want to book it for this month, or for a year out, I’m happy to get you on my calendar for an evening of fun, information, and a great time to be had by all. I offer my blow job classes in the Denver Metro area, including border, and for a travel fee, I’m happy to travel anywhere in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, Wyoming, and even nation wide if my plan tickets are covered. Head over here and contact me through my contact form, and we’ll set up a night to remember for you and your friends!PinterestFacebookTumblrGoogleTwitterEducational, Site News 10 Responses » Tagged with: blow job bachelorette party, blow job class, blow job class colorado, blow job class denver, blow job girls night in, blow job girls night out, blow job workshop, blow job workshop colorado, blow job workshop denver, colorado blow jobs, denver blow jobs, giving a blow job, how to give a blow job, how to give a blow job colorado, how to give a blow job denver, sex ed class colorado, sex ed class denver, sex ed workshops denver, sex edw workshops colorado, shanna katz blow jobsContactSearch the SiteKink AcademyAlong with more than 100 other educators, I offer video instruction across the spectrum of sexuality. 18+Enter Kink AcademyAmazon.com WidgetsFTM Packers, Binders, EtcRecommended Sites 18+Recent PostsNew to Kink: Beyond 50 ShadesPoly Weekly 409 Podcast TranscriptionHear me on Sex Out Loud Radio!Sex Toy Review: Lelo Gigi 2Sex Toy Review: Minna Ola (and Discount Code!)CategoriesCalls for SubmissionsEducationalFunInteresting LinksIntern CornerQ and AResearchReviewsSex Educator ProfileSite NewsThoughtsWorkshopsResourcesGLADISNANCSFNCTEOpening UpPFLAGPlanned ParenthoodRAINNSafe 2 PeeScarleteen (For All Ages)© 2013 Shanna Katz M.Ed, ACS -- Board Certified Sexologist and Sexuality Educator Suffusion theme by Sayontan Sinha"
