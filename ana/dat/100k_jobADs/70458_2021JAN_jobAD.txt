These include richly valued asset prices, fragile investment funds, the sustainability of sovereign and corporate debt, and weak bank profitability.ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos said: “The pandemic has caused one of the sharpest economic contractions in recent history, but wide-ranging policy measures have averted a financial meltdown.“However, the repercussions of the pandemic on bank profitability prospects and medium-term public finances will need to be addressed so that our financial system can continue to support the economic recovery.”	Thematic ReportsAre you worried about the pace of innovation in your industry?GlobalData's TMT Themes 2021 Report tells you everything you need to know about disruptive tech themes and which companies are best placed to help you digitally transform your business.Find out moreHSBC chief China economist Qu Hongbin wrote on the company’s blog that by April, only 76% of Chinese SMEs were back in business compared with 99% of larger companies in China.Qu Hongbin wrote: “That means an estimated 56 million workers had not returned to work – many in locked-down retail or catering firms.“Unlike in countries such as the US and UK, mainland China has not implemented a wage-protection scheme for furloughed workers.“This means most of the estimated 81 million Chinese, or 18% of urban workers, who became ’employed, but not working’, were not receiving income.”Hongbin believes that propping up domestic demand to support jobs thus remains a policy priority for China.Related CompaniesAlpex PharmaOral Drug Delivery Systems28 Aug 2020Visit ProfileDFE PharmaInhalation Product Development for the Pharmaceutical Industry28 Aug 2020Visit ProfileGuardtech CleanroomsCleanroom Design and Controlled Environments for the Pharmaceutical Industry28 Aug 2020Visit ProfileTop 5 Most ReadAnalysis 2 daysEnter Amazon Pharmacy: the beginning of a great online pharmacy fight?1Sponsored 4 daysA standard approach to drug development for accessing the globe2Analysis 6 daysGenomics and Covid-19: UK’s real-time surveillance system to track viral mutations3Analysis 6 daysDisease-cancelling drugs: Immuneering raises $62m in Series B round4Analysis 1 weekBiopharma M&A: EY analysts optimistic for 2021 deals after a mixed 20205Up NextCovid-19GlobalData Epidemiologist Report: US Covid death toll nears 400,000 – UK deaths exceed 90,00019 Jan 2021Covid-19International update: Global Covid infections pass 95.6 million – WHO slams vaccine profiteers19 Jan 2021Covid-19How Biden’s $1.9t stimulus package will help tackle Covid19 Jan 2021Covid-19GlobalData Epidemiologist Report: Global Covid deaths exceed 2 million as WHO asks for greater co-operation18 Jan 2021Powered byAbout UsEditorial ApproachContact UsTerms & ConditionsPrivacy Policy© Copyright 2021 Verdict Media Limited.Lost Password Back ⟶LoginRegisterGet new passwordLost Password?LoginRegistration is disabled.We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.
