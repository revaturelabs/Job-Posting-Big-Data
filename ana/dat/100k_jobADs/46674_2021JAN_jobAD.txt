"SCS Software's blog: Trucks & Trailers - our job is not over yetMonday, May 30, 2011Trucks & Trailers - our job is not over yetAs the various retail distribution masters are finalized (in the game industry jargon, the game is said to \"go gold\"), we still have some work to do. We are also working on new digital distribution strategy, using a new payment partner, so hopefully it should be possible to purchase the game not just with a credit card, but also with PayPal, and as we are told with additional no-so-usual payment methods as well. We still need to do some additional programming to make this happen, but we hope to be ready with the online time-limited demo version at the same time as the game hits the store shelves in CD editions.Our mind is still focused on T&T, and we thought we may do something to keep the game on your radar as well. So here we are with a Trucks & Trailers wallpaper! Several most popular screen resolutions are available for download...Published by SCS Software at 5/30/2011 11:02:00 AMEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestTags: Public Relations, Trucks and Trailers54 comments:Janos May 30, 2011 at 11:12 AMNice, thanks!ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyWrighty May 30, 2011 at 11:14 AMThis comment has been removed by the author.ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyMark May 30, 2011 at 11:16 AMThank you very much SCS :D Perfect!!ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyEvgeniy May 30, 2011 at 11:22 AMSweet!Wallpapers with ETS2 would be nice too :PReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous May 30, 2011 at 11:31 AMYes!
