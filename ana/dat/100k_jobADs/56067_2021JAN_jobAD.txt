I had long held the view, I said,that the churches had become irrelevant because they had allowed themselves tobe corrupted by new age secular humanism and political correctness.They had, I insisted, by trying to be all things to all menso compromised themselves that they no longer knew what they believed let alonepreached it.They had tried to hang on to their members and keep the fundsflowing in by watering down the gospel message so it more comfortably sat withmodern worldly beliefs and didn't offend anyone.But the result was the opposite. Churchgoers voted with theirfeet and walked out in their thousands. And that was because people had gone tochurch to be told what was true and what was lies, what was right and what waswrong, what was good and what was evil - in short, what was sin and what wasnot.They had gone to hear that Satan was roaming the world like aravening lion seeking to consume whom he would; but that God through JesusChrist was alive and ever ready to extend salvation to the repentant sinner andto hold out the promise of eternal life.That was not to say that all those who heard that messagewere likely to obey. But at least they knew there were limits on human behaviourand that if you went beyond them and got caught there was a penalty to pay.They kept going back to church week in and week out becausethey wanted to hear that message repeated over and over again to give them afocus and a sense of security in a world more and more rapidly becoming insecureand unfathomable economically, morally, politically and socially.Particularly was this so of children who in Sunday Schoolsthroughout the country heard the simple Christian message of be good for Jesussake, obey mum and dad and the teacher, be kind to others and try to live by theTen Commandments.Many a child went to Sunday School whose parents were neverseen. But that was okay by the church folk, who knew that the kids had been sentso mum and dad could have a bit of time to themselves on a Sunday morning.They didn't mind for they were devotees of the proverb:\"Train a child in the way he should go and he will not depart fromit.\"But when the ministers and priests and pastors stood by andwatched while the entire moral fabric of this nation was systematically rent,and began to eschew the black and white message of the gospels in favour of thegrey philosophies so beloved of the secular humanist and situational ethicist,there was no reason to go to church any more.But wait. Since I was asked the question I have thought aboutit a lot and have concluded that while some churches have been sidelined thereal Church - that body of born again, Spirit-filled believers who can be foundin every denomination - is today stronger than it has ever been in this countryand is going about the Lord's work with commitment and vigour.I am persuaded that if this were not so, our country would bein much direr straits than it is; that the salt and light being spread in allwalks of life by committed Christians is slowing down the putrefaction andholding back the darkness to which the powers of evil would condemn us.Many of them have taken to heart Jesus' words to hisdisciples: \"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be yetherefore as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves.\"They know that the battle is \"not against flesh andblood but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of thedarkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places\".So they beaver away quietly doing their best to show Christ'slove by living exemplary lives rather than by talking about their faith -\"walking the talk\" as modern idiom has it - and spend hours in prayeron behalf of others.They are not just to be found in the obvious places - thehigh-profile Christian charities, agencies and missions - but in schools,hospitals, welfare agencies, the armed forces, the police, prisons, the courts,national and local government politics and bureaucracies, sportingorganisations, every trade and service and in all manner of businesses.And on Sundays many of them will be in their churches,recharging their batteries with praise and worship. They will be more numerousthan all the spectators at all the sporting events in the country on anyweekend.So to my minister friend I now say this: Take heart. TheChurch has not been sidelined. It is alive, it is vital, it is carrying out thegreat commission and it cannot fail.Jesus said: \"I say unto thee that thou art Peter, andupon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevailagainst it.\"I can't put it plainer than that.(NZ Herald -– used by permission)About Garth GeorgeFiled Under: ArchiveLeave a Reply Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment.Subscriber LoginUsername or Email:Password:signup now | forgot password?Remember MeArchiveTHE TIME OF BEGINNING OF SORROWS AND THE RAPTURE Part 1 Posted on: Jun 19th, 2015 By Brian HayI had written this article some time ago and…SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: PUBLIC MEETING - Thursday 10th June 2010 - Gold Coast, Qland, Australia Posted on: Jun 9th, 2010 By Site AdminSPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: PUBLIC MEETING - Thursday…NEWS: The End of the old Omega Times Website Posted on: Mar 28th, 2010 By Logan AndersonA New Web Site for OMEGA TIMES has been under…Human Sacrifice, the Talmud, and the Moloch Problem Posted on: May 1st, 2009 By Carol A.
