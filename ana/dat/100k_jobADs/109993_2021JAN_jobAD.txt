After over 9 months delays in the formation of the RTGoNU, the President after consultation returned the country to 10 state and three administrative areas. This paved the way to the formation of in February 2020, which has brought renewed hope of setting South Sudan on the path towards peace and development. Even so, South Sudan remains highly fragile and the risks of relapsing into conflict are present, persistent as the country continues to face political, institutional, social, and economic challenges. The Greater Pibor Administrative Area (GPAA) and Jonglei State are entwined in protract inter and intracommunal violence often perpetrated by youths. Three major violent conflicts have been witnessed between GPAA and Greater Jonglei since February 2020, resulting in loss of many lives, abduction of children and women, huge displacement, loss of sources of livelihoods and destruction of shelters.The President, in response, has established a High Leve Committee to investigate the cause of conflict with a view to providing the President with recommendations on how to resolve it. UNDP is supporting this committee to visit GPAA to assess the effects of the violence as well as conduct consultations with local communities, to collect the views on how the conflict can be transformed peacefully. On the other hand, GPAA Chief Administrator has expressed the immediate needs of the area, being one of the most underdeveloped areas in the country.The protracted conflict in Greater Pibor Administrative Area is resource driven, as it is characterized by cattle raids, child abduction, competition over water points & pastures, highway robberies and ambushes. Thus, the sustainable peace and development cannot be achieved in the region without strategic community development of GPAA to address development deficit that form the basis and root causes of the structural violence. Thus, UNDP is seeking to engage a consultant to guide the process for the development of: 1) the Greater Pibor Administrative Area Strategic Community Development Plan with an implementation matrix/plan and budget; 2) GPAA Strategic Community Development Monitoring and Evaluation framework.
