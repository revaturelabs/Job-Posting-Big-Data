A New York Subway Tape	Snow Job: The Media Hysteria of AIDSBarbara Hammer1986, 7:42 min, color, sound\"I first heard of AIDS in 1985 when I was teaching at Columbia College in Chicago. I noticed the strange and inflammatory articles in the newspapers and I asked my students to collect hysteric headlines for me. And so I began my work on Snow Job: The Media Hysteria of AIDS. I examined the public ignorance, stigmatization, and just plain wrong attitudes towards this new illness. By making a snow storm of newspaper clippings I could show what a 'snow job' the media was making.\" — Barbara HammerElectronic Arts Intermix 535 West 22nd Street, 5th Flr New York, NY 10011 (212) 337 0680©1997 - 2021, Electronic Arts Intermix"
