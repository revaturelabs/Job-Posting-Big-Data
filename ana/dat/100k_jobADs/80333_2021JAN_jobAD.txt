THB, I don’t always know.First, if I share a job lead I typically include the rate if there is one in the original job posting. If not, then I don’t know.If it’s a publication I have written for, my answer is still likely to be “I don’t know”, because rates can vary significantly depending on a writer’s relationship with the publication, experience level, type of writing, and various other things.So what’s a writer to do? Well, you could reach out to the publication/organization and ~politely~ ask about rates, or you can try to find it on one of the many online freelance writer rates databases.I have a couple of go-to sites that I use:The Freelancer by Contently Rates DatabaseWho Pays WritersBoth are anonymous crowd-sourced lists where writers submit the rate they’ve been paid by a publication. Both lists regularly updated, include hundreds of online and print publications, and are FREE. FYI: You shouldn’t have to pay for this information, IMO.I hope that helps!If you have a resource for finding out how much publications pay freelance writers, please do share in the comments!Share this with your writer friends!Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)MoreClick to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...RelatedPublished by Writer for HireFreelance writer and published author always up for new writing opportunities.
