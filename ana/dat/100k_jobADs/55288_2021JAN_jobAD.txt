The unique way in which we deliver services and offer everyone who works here a voice, means that your career with us will be rewarding.Next employerCoca-Cola European PartnersOverviewFrom health visiting to district nursing, school nurses to specialist nurses, our nursing services help new parents to care for new born children and older people to continue living at home through care and support. We also have a wide range of therapy services for adults and children, including speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy whilst our specialist services focus on preventing diseases and supporting those living with specific conditions such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or diabetes.Bromley Healthcare is an independent provider of community health services like community nursing, children’s and adults therapy services, health improvement and intermediate care.At Bromley Healthcare, we work with the NHS, and quality is our top priority. We are guided by three simple values:To constantly improve our servicesTo treat others as we would like to be treatedTo hit our targetsWe support people at home and in the community and help them to live independently by supporting them in their own homes as far as possible. We have a long history of doing what we do, which makes us a safe pair of hands. But there’s an important difference between us and many other healthcare providers: we are a staff-owned Community Interest Company (a social enterprise).We are passionate about holding on to what’s best about the NHS—its dedicated staff committed to their patients and the quality of the services they offer. But we are also passionate about losing as much of the bureaucracy as we can, and developing our services to the highest possible standard for our patients. We are also able to reinvest any money we make in making the services even better. It’s an exciting way to work and to grow our business. This makes us a truly different kind of healthcare organisation to work for: one where everybody has a voice, and where we are better together. Read on to find out why Bromley Healthcare is a great place to work and to build your career…What benefits can you expect from us?As well as being a vibrant and stimulating place to work, Bromley Healthcare offers some generous staff benefits:PensionOur pension is provided as part of a bespoke package of benefits for our employees. It comprises the following benefit arrangements for members of the pension scheme. Group Personal Pension (GPP) Life Assurance One of the key benefits we provide is a sponsored pension arrangement—the Bromley Healthcare Group Personal Pension (GPP).Planning in advance for your retirement is very important because, for many people, it brings a major change in financial circumstances and lifestyle. Broadly comparable to the NHS Pension, our GPP has been established to help you save for your retirement.We will pay contributions on behalf of our employees, in addition to your normal salary. Compared to most public sector pensions our GPP gives you much more choice over your pension. As an employee, you will have your own plan within the group arrangements and have control over how much you contribute, where your money will be invested and when you start to receive your pension.Holidays and flexible workingRest is as important as hard work. We offer our staff a generous holiday allowance of 27-33 days depending on length of service, as well as paid bank holidays. We also recognise that the pressures of life are different for different people, and they change over your career.We are committed to supporting our staff in achieving a work-life balance. To support this, we offer other types of leave such as maternity and paternity leave, carers leave, study leave and career breaks. Where operationally practicable, flexible working options from job sharing to mobile working and working from home are available to staff.We already support many of our staff in working flexibly, allowing them to be able to perform to their best. However, while flexible solutions will be sought, it is also very important that we continue to recognise the needs of our patients.Training, development and career progressionAt Bromley Healthcare, we believe that our staff are our greatest asset, and we cannot provide excellent and innovative care without them. We are committed to supporting our staff to be the best that they can be, through substantial investment in education and training.

It includes internal courses; and external opportunities such as clinical courses at universities; clinical conferences and updates; essential business and IT skills; NVQs; and performance management courses.Looking to the future, we offer staff opportunities to be sponsored for professional registration training. We also offer apprenticeships, graduate internships and work experience placements for people who are looking to work in healthcare. While we are keen to bring new skills and experience in to the company, we also believe in growing our own talent.All of our staff have an annual appraisal where they are able to discuss their development needs and aspirations.
