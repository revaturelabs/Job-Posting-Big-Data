"Assessing Assessment – Fresh and CrispySkip to contentFresh and CrispyMore (or less) original insights from an old bloggerMenuHomeAboutTwitterFacebookGoogle+GitHubWordPress.comAssessing AssessmentAs noted in Innovating e-Learning 2011 : JISC and Poacher turned gamekeeper I am attending the Innovating E-Learning Online Conference during the gaps in my full calendar. Today there was a quite large gap between the morning session (on Work-based Learning) and the final plenary session on Theme 1: Learning Landscapes and I was able to fill in a locally arrange Swansea Academy of Learning and Teaching (SALT) seminar lunchtime seminar on Multiple Choice: The smart choice or dumbing down?During this session we learned about a local HEA funded project that is looking at the value of single selection versus elimination-style multiple choice questions in the life sciences and this was followed by an excellent presentation from Steve Draper of Glasgow University called Improving deep learning with Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and Electronic Voting Systems (EVS).Following on, as it did quite by chance, from an excellent Activity-Week introduction to PeerWise (mentioned in Steve’s talk) and conference sessions on Assessment and Feedback and Students as Agents of Change (at which EVS came highly recommended by students in the Business School at Exeter), I feel justified in struggling with computer-based assessment and eager to try some of the new-to-me techniques mentioned by Steve and my colleagues from life sciences here at Swansea.Having been excused from a staff-student committee by my Head of Teaching in order to attend this session, I hope that I will also be able to pass back the message that MCQs and EVSs are legitimate and powerful learning tools when used correctly.Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInLike this:Like Loading...Author: cpjoblingSenior lecturer, College of Engineering, Swansea University	View all posts by cpjobling	Author cpjoblingPosted on November 23, 2011 Categories Uncategorised	Post navigationPrevious Previous post: my bookmarks 11/23/2011Next Next post: my bookmarks 11/24/2011Recent PostsHopes and fears for the future May 21, 2020Resurrection Day April 1, 2020#virtualcoffee March 20, 2020Domain of Mine Own January 3, 2018Chris Jobling’s Stories December 21, 2017Search for:SearchMy TweetsMy TweetsNovember 2011MTWTFSS1 2 3 4 5 67 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 19 2021 22 23 24 25 26 2728 29 30« Oct Dec »ArchivesMay 2020April 2020March 2020January 2018December 2017October 2017September 2017July 2017June 2017April 2017March 2017January 2017December 2016November 2016October 2016September 2016July 2016April 2016February 2016January 2016November 2015December 2014October 2014September 2014August 2014July 2014June 2014April 2014November 2013October 2013August 2013July 2013December 2012September 2012June 2012May 2012April 2012March 2012February 2012January 2012December 2011November 2011October 2011August 2011July 2011June 2011April 2011March 2011February 2011January 2011December 2010November 2010October 2010September 2010August 2010July 2010June 2010May 2010April 2010March 2010February 2010December 2009November 2009October 2009September 2009August 2009July 2009June 2009May 2009March 2009February 2009January 2009December 2008November 2008October 2008September 2008August 2008July 2008June 2008May 2008March 2008February 2008January 2008December 2007October 2007September 2007August 2007July 2007June 2007May 2007April 2007March 2007February 2007January 2007September 2006July 2006June 2006May 2006April 2006August 2005July 2005May 2005April 2005March 2005February 2005January 2005December 2004November 2004September 2004August 2004July 2004June 2004May 2004Category Cloud#12AoC #AdaLovelaceDay #byod4l #codesign16 #FLble2 #GuildChat #HEAChat #HEblogswap #LTHEChat #OpenEdMOOC #SocMedHE16 #susalt17 audience response Blackboard Learn Blog cpd JISC Moment online events OpenEdMOOC open education Photography reflection storify student engagement Swansea technology enhanced learning twitter Uncategorised vleHomeAboutTwitterFacebookGoogle+GitHubWordPress.comFresh and Crispy Website Powered by WordPress.com.%d bloggers like this:"
