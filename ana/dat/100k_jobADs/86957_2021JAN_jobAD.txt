Recipes, Reviews, Culinary Musings.Search:Perks of the Job08 Thursday Nov 2007Posted by snackingkitchen in Uncategorized	‚âà 2 CommentsNow that I‚Äôve been at the Cuisine for over a month, I thought I‚Äôd share some of the perks of the job.Aside from a very well stocked office supply cabinet (who can resist color sharpie pens, highlighters and post-its, to name a few), the biggest perk of working here is food!Now, as I have mentioned before, most Cuisine employees eat breakfast and lunch at work. I thought it‚Äôd be fun and eye-opening to share some of these meals.Today, when I came downstairs to the test kitchen for coffee, I saw the most beautiful sight ‚Äì a gorgeous, tall, dark (what are you thinking?), layered carrot cake! I am usually not a big fan of carrot cakes (too much cinnamon), but this one was honestly THE best carrot cake I‚Äôve had. Moist, rich, perfectly balanced in flavors, the cake was a perfect way to start my morning.Here are some other meals (notice the emphasis on ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù items! ‚Äì we have been actually in the editing process during the last couple of weeks, as a result the recipe testing no longer takes place and meals are prepared by one of the editors for the whole staff)Tomato bisque with grilled cheese sandwiches ‚Äì to my surprise, the sandwiches had mustard inside ‚Äì a delicious twist on a traditional grilled cheese. Apparently, people in the Midwest eat their grilled cheese sandwiches dipped in ketchup.Baked macaroni and cheese topped with breadcrumbs.Bologna sandwiches ‚Äì who would‚Äôve thought? (I skipped on that one)Chocolate cake, chocolate chip cookies, brownies, rice crispy treats, caramel apples.Baked meatballs in tomato sauce with garlic breadHearty soupsPizzaThai food take-outMore to comeBon appetitWant to share?TweetEmailLike this:Like Loading...RelatedPost navigation‚Üê Previous post Next post ‚Üí2 thoughts on ‚ÄúPerks of the Job‚Äù	Olga said:	November 8, 2007 at 4:02 pmSO totally jealous!
