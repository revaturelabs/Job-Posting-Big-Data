If you can create a solid recruiting culture, you’ll learn that your employees can be your best recruiting and hiring tool.Employees who grasp the value of hiring and what hiring the right talent truly does are employees that can refer great people they know to open jobs, help promote job openings online in their network, and help keep those new hires engaged and motivated.A hiring culture can be built in a few ways.Allocate the right resources.Give the people who are interviewing the time and resources that it takes to recruit and hire your top talent.Sometimes interviews are seen as a distraction from real work when they are quite the opposite.When the value of interviews is expressed employees will take their role much more seriously.This also extends to those that are being interviewed. Give them the right amount of time to be interviewed and make sure to follow up with them on a timely manner. If you need a few people to sign off on your hire, make sure you express the time table to anyone interviewing for your open positions. Candidates have many options right now so making it a priority to expedite the interview and follow up process can mean the difference between top talent working for you or someone else.Make hiring efficient.Make sure you have an efficient hiring procedure in place.This can mean a lot of different things to different businesses but generally you want to focus on clear pre-screening questions, great interviewing practices, a standard followup procedure, and a conscious effort to expedite the entire process from interview to job offer makes both those interviewing and those being interviewed much happier.Great pre-screening questions include things like:What kind of work environment do you enjoy most?What are your salary and benefit requirements?How would you describe your skills when working in a team?How important is customer satisfaction to you?Why are you looking for a new job?Why do you think you’d be a good fit at our company?Interviewing processes and practices should be standardized so you can accurately and fairly compare candidates to one another. Having a set list of questions per person interviewing, a grading scale, and a de-brief meeting after you interview means honest and open discussions within your team to find the right placement in your organization.Follow up should look the same between all candidates and include a procedure to alert someone when they did not get the job. Too many times candidates are left wondering if you filled the position or not – so make sure they know as soon as possible that you did.A conscious effort to expedite the process could mean a few things – cutting down the length of each interview, or the number of interviews candidates are expected to take part in, and better pre-screening all make the entire process more streamlined.Make it know that everyone should spend time recruiting.It should not be left up to just the person or department tasked to hire to recruit top talent alone. Make it known that everyone, even your leadership team at the top, should be spending time recruiting.This can mean using their network, getting out in front of people, and making sure to reinforce the big-picture recruiting strategy whenever possible. A key to making this work is also making it as frictionless as possible. Allow time during work hours to attend networking meetups, learning lunches, and events that can get employees in your organization in front of potential job seekers.Leadership and executives should be eager to help champion the cause, and everyone else should know that recruiting and hiring is a serious task that requires everyone to live a “hiring culture” each day.There is great value in finding the right talent and everyone who works at your business should know and understand that.Creating a purpose-driven culture that is excited about recruiting helps a business achieve it’s strategic goals. A culture that promotes hiring and recruiting encourages your entire team to remain active and engaged in a hiring process and creates a deeper buy-in.This shows that anyone in your company has a say in hiring and can influence decisions in staff – and everyone can reap the benefits.Anyone in your company has an impact on hiring and ultimately key decisions that impact the growth and success of the company.
