But fact is, most fresh grads that join small firms these days are underpaid. That's the reality. Employers who can opt for cheaper alternatives won't pay you more than if they choose not to. Especially smaller firms who's sole focus is on PnL and nothing else.#933 (permalink)14-07-2015, 01:00 PMUnregisteredGuestPosts: n/aQuote:Originally Posted by UnregisteredHi peeps.

Please do not tell me big four all that .. haha.2.2k (at a small firm) is slightly underpaid, but not by much. Probably just missing the mark by 200 to 300.Nevertheless, do take into consideration other factors, e.g. whether you like the nature of the work that you will be doing at the small firm, how the experience at the small firm could potentially propel you into other more lucrative jobs etc.SG Bus Timing App - the best bus app - available on iOS and AndroidSGX Stocks [Android] App - check latest share prices on the goSGX Stocks [iPad] app | SGX Stocks [iPhone] app#934 (permalink)14-07-2015, 04:38 PMUnregisteredGuestPosts: n/aCheaper better faster#935 (permalink)14-07-2015, 06:03 PMUnregisteredGuestPosts: n/aQuote:Originally Posted by Unregistered2.2k (at a small firm) is slightly underpaid, but not by much.

Why I say will that is because if you dont like procurement and you still want to go in, most likely you will do a career switch after one or two years later. then you will have to start from zero again.Do consider this carefully.#938 (permalink)17-07-2015, 08:47 PMUnregisteredGuestPosts: n/aHi currently 25 fresh grad from Singapore Poly with dip in mech engine. Don't see myself in the engineering sector and would want to equip myself with a degree from another sector.I also seek your opinions regarding whether to pursue full time or part time studies. As I'm a late bloomer upon completion of full time studies I would be 28-29 and I'm old for a fresh grad without experience.At the same time also considering working on a full time basis while completing a part time degree, as I really feel guilty burdening my parents at such a mature age already, I would be able to earn my own pocket money, build up some savings and also help my parents with the fees.If I'm doing full time, will get a casual part time working maybe once or twice a week to earn some money, but the negative is it's not real work experience.Upon completion of the part time degree, I would also have at least 3 years of working experience and I should be able to transition to a better job probably within the same industry much easily.Look forward to your thoughts and opinions.#939 (permalink)17-07-2015, 10:59 PMUnregisteredGuestPosts: n/aQuote:Originally Posted by UnregisteredHi currently 25 fresh grad from Singapore Poly with dip in mech engine.

Considering your age and financial situation, you might find in the end buying a part time degree doesn't really help much in your career.#940 (permalink)18-07-2015, 12:20 AMUnregisteredGuestPosts: n/aQuote:Originally Posted by UnregisteredMaybe you should try to work in the industry that you are interested in for a few years before deciding whether to study. Considering your age and financial situation, you might find in the end buying a part time degree doesn't really help much in your career.Hi there, my family financial situation is relatively stable, they have set aside funds for futhering my stdies but I already view myself as a mature adult so I feel bad burdening my parents with this responsibility.Have strong interests in the aerospace industry, but I don't really see myself as an LAE or to be or an a.craft technician. Other non-technical positions comes largely from CAAS and CAG and it's no secret they value scholars and local uni grads much much more. So that explains why I feel very lost now at this juncture.I personally feel that working full-time while studying at night is a very viable option and it's also important to find a job that tallies with the degree that I will choose to study, otherwise it will come to naught.Page 94 of 401 « First < 44 84 92 93 94 95 96 104 144 194 > Last »BookmarksDiggdel.icio.usStumbleUponGoogleTagssim, starting pay, uol« Previous Thread | Next Thread »Thread ToolsShow Printable VersionEmail this PagePosting RulesYou may not post new threadsYou may post repliesYou may not post attachmentsYou may not edit your postsBB code is OnSmilies are On[IMG] code is OnHTML code is OffTrackbacks are OffPingbacks are OnRefbacks are OffForum RulesSimilar ThreadsThread Thread Starter Forum Replies Last PostStarting pay for fresh uni grad with partial acca geeokleiv Income and Jobs 86 Yesterday 03:53 PMStarting pay for fresh grad? k3vin Income and Jobs 19 30-03-2018 01:39 AMFresh Grad with Masters starting salary in banking Novice Income and Jobs 18 09-02-2016 08:57 PMFresh Engineering Grad want to switch to Banking rampa001 Income and Jobs 53 17-09-2011 10:42 AMFresh Grad working as software engineer earning 10k/month megasoma Income and Jobs 7 28-07-2011 10:23 AM» 30 Recent ThreadsHow is life as a doctor in...
