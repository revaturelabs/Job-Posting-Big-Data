Collectively they are referred to as “Andover Summer”. Our flagship program, Summer Session, challenges students in an innovative five-week, residential program. More than 60 courses are offered, ranging from computer science to marine biology, from ethics and philosophy to economics. Summer Session students bring the world into the classroom by virtue of their enormous diversity of geographic origin, religion, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background. With strong academic records and a serious desire to spend the summer in a residential community, our students enjoy challenging themselves and one another through disciplined study. eSummer, our online alternative to the on-campus experience offered by Summer Session, focuses on personalized, mastery-based experiences for students working at their own pace and following their own interests. Courses are designed to run primarily asynchronously, with weekly 1:1 meetings between the teacher and the student to discuss their Personalized Learning Plan, as well as weekly full-group synchronous sessions. Every summer Phillips Academy hires a number of visiting teachers to teach, coach, and house counsel in its summer program. Mathematics & Science for Minority Students – better known as (MS)2 – is a residential, STEM scholarship program for underrepresented students of color that runs concurrently with Summer Session. A Summer Session faculty member’s experience is rigorous and thoroughly challenging, for Phillips Academy requires superior classroom performance of its teachers, TAs, House Counselors, and students alike. Regardless of program, An Andover Summer is short, intense, and strongly academic.About the RoleTAs are paired with experienced Mentor Teachers for the duration of the summer, collaborating closely to execute on the syllabus designed by the Mentor. Together, TAs and their Mentor Teachers are charged with ensuring that students in their classes have a challenging and academically rigorous summer experience, while also making learning incredibly fun. We see teaching in Summer Session as an opportunity for teachers to innovate and experiment; there is no strict curriculum to which teachers must adhere (outside of following the general guidance provided by the course description). Project-based, hands-on, authentic learning experiences are encouraged, and TAs should be prepared to support their mentors in leading students through an intensive and highly engaging exploration of their chosen content. With the support of their mentors, TAs work towards planning and leading at least one complete lesson over the course of the summer.Typically, TAs are hired to support in two courses, to house counsel and to coach an afternoon activity; assignments may vary slightly depending on the program. TAs should expect to have roughly 35-40 hours per week of assigned duties, including ~ 3 hours of class (Monday-Saturday), ~1 hour of coaching or club facilitation (Monday-Friday), and ~2.5 hours of evening study hours supervision (Sunday-Friday). Absences from assigned duties are not permitted. Few exceptions are made to this policy, although unusual circumstances may determine that an applicant’s situation should be handled on an individual basis. TAs are also expected to chaperone at least two on-campus social events and at least two off-campus trips during the summer. TAs live in Academy-provided housing, either in student dorms (if serving as house counselors) or in faculty-only dorms, and have full access to all Phillips Academy facilities for the duration of the summer.In addition to working collaboratively with the Mentor Teacher to complete all instructional duties described above, TAs are responsible for ensuring that their own developmental needs are met and that they engage with the opportunities provided for skill-building and support.TAs’ Responsibilities and DutiesPre-Summer· Become familiar with all materials sent in advance for your review.· Complete required pre-employment activities including HR paperwork, background checks/fingerprinting, and completion of online trainings.· Communicate with the Mentor Teacher about personal/professional goals, expectations, and desired level of engagement during the summer.· Become familiar with the preliminary course syllabus created by the Mentor Teacher.· Attend faculty orientation.· In collaboration with the Mentor Teacher, prepare classroom for summer.
