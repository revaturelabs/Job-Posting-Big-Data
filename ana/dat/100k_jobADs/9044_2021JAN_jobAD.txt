This is happening to many job seekers applying for various jobs in Ethiopia through job portals such Ezega Jobs, EmployEthiopia, EthioJobs, Mjobs, etc. In many cases, the reasons are simple and common.Regardless of whether you are applying from mjobs or employethiopia or any other, the hiring manager normally gets many resumes to review. The number one question in the mind of the hiring manager is who among the many applicants can best handle the job at hand. The only way to tell prior to interviews is through resumes and cover letters. The hiring manager would normally look for someone who has done something similar or at least one who showed interest in the work being advertised. If your cover letter so generic (the same for all jobs), you will be talking about something else not related to the job you are applying - which means, in the eye of the hiring manager, you are not suitable for the job you are applying. So, it is extremely important that you edit the cover letter for each job you are applying to show interest in the job, and to mention something related that you have done or studied in the past. The main point is that you are conveying a message to the hiring manager that you understand what the job needs and you have done or studied something related to the job you are applying.You may also edit you resume for each job you are applying to highlight any study or work you have done that is a requirement for the job. That way the hiring manager doesn't have to look hard to find it. Remember, hiring managers barely have a few minutes to spend on each job application. So, putting up front or highlighting the relevant skills or knowledge you have increases your chance of getting called for interview.Also, please answer any questions the hiring manager is asking in the vacancy announcement. If it was asked that you must have certain computer skills, please state that in your cover letter and resume. If the vacancy post asks to state your typing speed in words per minute, you should state that in your cover letter. That will be greatly appreciated by the hiring manager for any jobs here, ethiojobs net or mjobs. If you ignore any requests or questions like these that the job post requests, it means you are not giving any attention to details of the job application requirements, and the chances of you getting called for interview becomes very low.Finally, please send only what is asked in the vacancy announcement. If the job post asks you to send only cover letter and resume, just send the cover letter and resume - not all documents you have.For more advice on crareers, please visit our Ezega Employement and Career Center in our Entertainment/Blogs section.
