By using job posting structured data markup and sitemaps, Avionté will be able to directly integrate with Google to ensure the best visibility for clients’ job postings.“Through client feedback and our agile development process, we were able to take immediate action on something that is vital for our clients,” said Jami Klotz, Vice President of Product Management at Avionté. “We know the importance of our clients being able to connect with candidates wherever they are actively seeking out jobs, which is why we made this a priority on our roadmap.”With 77.43 percent of the search engine market share globally and more than 34 billion monthly searches in the U.S., Google is the search engine leader. This product update ensures Avionté job postings will show up in one central location for candidates, where they are likely already actively searching for and seeking out jobs. It also ensures Avionté clients’ job postings have prominent placement in the search results, leading to increased discovery and more conversions.The Google for Jobs product update will pull in both clients’ job postings and the logo used on the Job Board Module, which will provide clients’ better branding and visibility on Google for Jobs. Avionté plans to continue this momentum through the remainder of 2017 and into 2018, providing the best functionality and continuing to stay ahead of industry trends.“This is just one example of what Avionté has planned for future product updates,” Klotz said. “Keeping ahead of industry trends and technologies to enable our clients to be more successful is of utmost importance to us and this is just the start.”About AviontéWith over a decade dedicated to the staffing and recruiting industry, Avionté offers front and back office enterprise software with a strong focus on service and retention.
