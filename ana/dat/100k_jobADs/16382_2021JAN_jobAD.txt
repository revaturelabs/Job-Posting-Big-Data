the ‘OUTSTANDING’ award with her team in the gardens of the care home.Staff and residents at Red Oaks Care Home in Henfield, West Sussex, are celebrating their recent Care Quality Commission inspection rating, where they scored an overall ‘Outstanding’ after being reviewed for a safe, effective, caring, responsive and well-led service.Currently only 2.4% of England’s care homes, domiciliary care agencies and hospitals have an overall ‘Outstanding’ rating , so Red Oaks has been ranked among the best in the country for the quality of the services it provides.The CQC inspected the home on 16th and 18th January (the report was released on 6th April) and rated the home, run by Barchester Healthcare, as ‘Outstanding” in two key assessment areas (‘Caring’ & ‘Responsive’) and ‘Good’ in three (‘Safe’, ‘Effective’ & ‘Well-led’).The report stated that “People using the service, their relatives and health and social care professionals were highly complementary about the standard of care provided. People consistently spoke positively of the kindness and compassionate manner of staff towards them. People using the service and their relatives experienced a care delivery that was inclusive and empowering. This resulted in people enjoying spending their days at the home and an improvement of their well-being.”Linda Ryan, General Manager at Red Oak Care Home said: “We are ecstatic! Our team at Red Oaks work so hard to provide the highest possible standard of care for everyone who lives at the home and we are so delighted to be recognised for our work by the CQC, and to be rated ‘Outstanding’ overall.“I’m very proud of the whole team. From our hospitality teams, to our activity co-ordinators and our dedicated carers and nurses contribute to the level of care we are able to provide. Passionate about the residents in our care are the key to our fantastic result”.Red Oaks Care Home is run by Barchester Healthcare, one of the UK’s largest care providers, which is committed to delivering high-quality care across its care homes and hospitals.
