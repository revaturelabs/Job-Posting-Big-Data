"SCS Software's blog: Paint jobs for our Brazilian fansWednesday, June 11, 2014Paint jobs for our Brazilian fansBrazil's economy depends to a large extent on truck transportation. Truck manufacturers from all over the world are competing for the Brazilian market intensely. Brazil is a big country, and it has come a long way to becoming a major global economical power.So obviously it is not a coincidence that we have a lot of players playing and buying our truck sims in Brazil. There is a very strong fan community there, many people making mods, uploading YouTube movies, sending us e-mails with suggestions. Even though there is a language barrier for us at SCS to understand what our games' players at the various community websites are talking about, we understand that this is a country with a big potential for our games in the future, and that we should pay more attention to it.As a way to say \"thanks\" to our fans in Brazil, and also to celebrate the upcoming World Cup football championship just starting in Brazil, we are releasing a new truck paint job pack for Euro Truck Simulator 2 today.

At least in Chile there are lots of international truck brands and a Wide variety of landscapes and weather conditions (the exception is the tropical one). Chilean highways look extremely similar to the european ones (in fact, we use the same traffic signals) because there are direct european invest in road infraestructure.

You can make longer and heavier trailers which would be more interesting to hauling. I really appreciate as a STEAM user all the effort you put in the game for a game that is 2 years out.

How old is passed away and managed to not want to put additional trucks we buy at the map, we would like to see our employees. About American Truck, not launch, will be a failure. We want to see new things. You're not going to escape to create a multiplayer version, you can not close the doors. If you really do not want to be forgotten hear the voices of his fans.

That's why ProMods became so succesful, there was demand for some new roads and they ceated Scandinavia, pieces of France and even Spain and Portugal is upcoming there, for free. Why can promods do this part-time with custom junctions and SCS not, with the probably standard prefabs and full-time?? Or is France, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Scandinavia ready and in huge test-fase we don't know of.Hopefully the last is fact, but fortunately, there's ProMods for some good extentions on the map. SCS is just to follow before every area is already covered and people willm not buy paid map DLC anymore because every ares is available free of charge then made by some good modders.ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous June 12, 2014 at 3:11 PMOh for gods sake, stop it.

Last week a new Nordic DLC appears to be in progress. Definitely not a coincidence!Why didn't they call the TSM team or the Hungarian team to \"thank\" them too?But, the ProMods team won't give their work for free. That's why they sell the many small DLC packs.Anyway, that's my theory.

The most Fuck all the same, is that SCS puts a lot of information about what's to come, this is your big problem, in my opinion should do first then publish something, and do not post that has, alas is fuck. marketing ..? ... wrong right ... sell one thing it does have is fuck.! Now we need to wait, drive through the cities of Europe, see the bus stop, see empty terminals, seems even abandoned cities, knowing that one day we will have something like buses in the game? I think not ... wait for new trucks, for 2015 it absolutely. ETS2 make a really cool game, great graphics, but put 50,000 updates is bad, we are in the era of 1.10.x, what comes? 1.11.1? and there goes until when?? 1,100. ? 2.1.0? all mods like bug that fans do not work on a new version, so why put tools to do mods? if in 3 months or more will have a new patch, and fudeo all over again? Makes a game ends and puts a full pacth, or is 2 or 3 updates at most, oh yes we do an improved game, modelers.ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyMADxMAX June 16, 2014 at 7:59 PMIf you currently do not own the full version of ETS2 but would like to, the TSGmods.com forums is currently running a competition to win the full version of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and the Going East DLC, for your chance to win, simply follow this link here:http://www.tsgmods.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=3050ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyUnknown June 18, 2014 at 8:46 AMWhen will quit the game American Truck Simulator?
