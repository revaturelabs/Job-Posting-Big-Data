However, I received a Big 4 job offer and will be starting that job in the fall.I plan to take two months off to breathe before I start in the fall, but I know that eventually I will take the CPA exam. Should I work a little bit and get used to my new job or take the exam as soon as I can? – MaggieDear Maggie,Congrats on the new degree and the new job!
