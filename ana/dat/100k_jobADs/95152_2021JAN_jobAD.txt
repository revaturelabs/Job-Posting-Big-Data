It has undergone significant transformation in the past decade, with remarkable increases in retention and graduation alongside reductions in the achievement gap. Drawn by an increasingly rich academic and social experience and competitive pricing, students increasingly seek a URI education, with applications up 40 percent since 2009. Fifty-two percent of URI students come from Rhode Island and 48 percent from out of state and 75 countries. URI has nearly 1,200 faculty members, two-thirds full-time, with more than half of the full-time faculty hired in the past decade. This increasingly vibrant and scholarly faculty have propelled steady improvement in sponsored research, growing from $65 million in 2010 to over $104 million in external awards in 2020.URI has also been an astute steward of its finances, leveraging public support to make over $900 million in capital investments in the past 10 years. In Fall 2020, URI publicly launched its most ambitious capital campaign to date, a $250-million effort that has already raised over $180 million. In an act of abiding public trust, the state reorganized the University's governance, creating an independent seventeen-member board composed of both self-perpetuating trustees and public appointees.As it turns to the next decade, URI desires an innovative leader who can sustain and accelerate the University's impressive trajectory-someone with experience managing complex budgets and multiple constituencies in a higher education setting. URI aims to provide the finest holistic student experience available and to do so at a competitive cost. The president should be a scholarly and interdisciplinary leader capable of promoting and elevating faculty-driven research and who can persuasively communicate campus accomplishments to new and existing supporters. Moreover, the University's success must be premised on equity and justice. The president must be a champion for all faculty, staff, and students, especially the most historically marginalized members of our society. Unimpeachable ethics and commitment to transparency and shared governance are essential. The URI community seeks a president who can harness their pride and enthusiasm and lead them toward another transformational decade.The University of Rhode Island has retained the national executive search firm Isaacson, Miller to assist in this important search.
