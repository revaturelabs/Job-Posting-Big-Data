Information about the future concerns the entire group.The future situation of the occupational group on the labour marketThe employment prospects for this occupational group in the 2009-2013 period will be as follows:PoorVery goodThe chances of finding employment for this occupational group in 2009-2013 are slightly above average. As compared to the development in the 2003-2008 period these chances will remain about the same. The most severe shortage of workers is expected in the operation of power facilities where the average age is over 50 years. Many employees will retire and the supply of graduates to replace them will be insufficient in the following years. However, the largest subgroup within this occupational group consists of drivers of motor vehicles who are employed in ground transport and other industries. Their employment prospects for the near future have been severely worsened by the economic downturn and the reduction in industrial output - the volume of freight transport has considerably decreased in the CR. Operators of metalworking machine tools also face unfavourable prospects. The fact that the employment prospects for this group as a whole are above the average is the result of both the age structure (over one quarter of drivers are older than 50, and the same is true of as many as one third of metalworking machine tools operators) and the declining number of graduates of the relevant study programmes. It will be rather difficult to replace the leaving employees.Development of the employment in the occupational group (in thousands):Total employmentDevelopment of employment in this occupational groupThe current situation of the occupational group at the labour market:The occupational group consists of the following subgroups:ISCO 832 - Motor vehicle driversISCO 812 - Metal-processing plant operatorsISCO 816 - Power-production and related plant operatorsISCO 731 - Precision workers in metal and related materialsISCO 832ISCO 812ISCO 816ISCO 731Motor vehicle drivers (ISCO 832)Development of employment in this occupational subgroup (in thousands)Total employmentDevelopment of employment in this occupational subgroupOccupations in this subgroup are most frequently found in the following industries:Land transport (59 %)Construction (8 %)Wholesale trade and sale and repair of motor vehicles (5 %)Other community, social and personal service activities (4 %)The food and tobacco industries (4 %)In 2008 the median age of employees in this subgroup was 40 years, in the economy as a whole it was 41 years.The age structure of employees in this occupational subgroup:Employees in this occupational subgroup most frequently have the following qualification:Secondary (3c) - vehicle maintenance, mechanical engineering, metallurgy (49 %)Secondary (3c) - building (11 %)It is expected that by 2013 the following number of graduates with qualifications suitable for this occupational subgroup will enter the labour market:EducationNumber of graduates entering labour market by 2013Development of graduate numbers in 2009-2013Secondary (3c) - vehicle maintenance, mechanical engineering, metallurgy 31 180 slight decreaseSecondary (3c) - building 11 300 rapid decreaseThe development of the number of graduates is ranked using a five-degree scale: rapid decrease - slight decrease - stagnation - slight increase - rapid increase.Metal-processing plant operators (ISCO 812)Development of employment in this occupational subgroup (in thousands)Total employmentDevelopment of employment in this occupational subgroupOccupations in this subgroup are most frequently found in the following industries:Manufacture of basic metals (60 %)Manufacture of metal structures and fabricated metal products (19 %)Manufacture of motor vehicles (10 %)In 2008 the median age of employees in this subgroup was 38 years, in the economy as a whole it was 41 years.The age structure of employees in this occupational subgroup:Employees in this occupational subgroup most frequently have the following qualification:Secondary (3c) - vehicle maintenance, mechanical engineering, metallurgy (45 %)It is expected that by 2013 the following number of graduates with qualifications suitable for this occupational subgroup will enter the labour market:EducationNumber of graduates entering labour market by 2013Development of graduate numbers in 2009-2013Secondary (3c) - vehicle maintenance, mechanical engineering, metallurgy 31 180 slight decreaseThe development of the number of graduates is ranked using a five-degree scale: rapid decrease - slight decrease - stagnation - slight increase - rapid increase.Power-production and related plant operators (ISCO 816)Development of employment in this occupational subgroup (in thousands)Total employmentDevelopment of employment in this occupational subgroupOccupations in this subgroup are most frequently found in the following industries:Generation and distribution of electricity and heat (33 %)Collection, purification and distribution of water (16 %)In 2008 the median age of employees in this subgroup was 50 years, in the economy as a whole it was 41 years.The age structure of employees in this occupational subgroup:Employees in this occupational subgroup most frequently have the following qualification:Secondary (3c) - vehicle maintenance, mechanical engineering, metallurgy (31 %)It is expected that by 2013 the following number of graduates with qualifications suitable for this occupational subgroup will enter the labour market:EducationNumber of graduates entering labour market by 2013Development of graduate numbers in 2009-2013Secondary (3c) - vehicle maintenance, mechanical engineering, metallurgy 31 180 slight decreaseThe development of the number of graduates is ranked using a five-degree scale: rapid decrease - slight decrease - stagnation - slight increase - rapid increase.Precision workers in metal and related materials (ISCO 731)Development of employment in this occupational subgroup (in thousands)Total employmentDevelopment of employment in this occupational subgroupOccupations in this subgroup are most frequently found in the following industries:Manufacture of electrical machinery and manufacture of medical, precision and optical instruments (24 %)Retail trade, repair of personal and household goods (21 %)Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c.
