When it comes to additional module electronics versus lean system design with modern inverter technology, Hannes Knopf is in his element. The expert in modern string inverter features knows why module optimizers are a safety risk. He explains how operators and installers can benefit from greater efficiency and safety over the entire system life with the integrated SMA ShadeFix software.by Anke Baars, 7. May. 2020 , 2 CommentsSolutionsBattery repowering for SMA off-grid systemsOver 800 million people in the world have no access to an electricity supply. A sustainable solution is available in the form of off-grid systems. These produce renewable energy from sun, wind or water in the exact places where it is needed. SMA off-grid systems are extremely robust and can therefore be modernized, even when the batterie´s lifecycle ends. Replacing old lead-acid batteries now with modern lithium-ion technology increases the efficiency and service life of the off-grid system.by Anke Baars, 4.
