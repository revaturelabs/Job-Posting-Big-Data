"Jobless Recoveries: The Interaction between Financial and Search Frictions | NEP-DGE BlogNEP-DGE BlogDiscussion about the latest research in Dynamic General Equilibrium theoryHomeAboutJobless Recoveries: The Interaction between Financial and Search FrictionsBy Dennis Wesselbaumhttp://d.repec.org/n?u=RePEc:otg:wpaper:1603&r=dgeThis paper establishes a link between labor market frictions and financial market frictions. We present empirical evidence about the relation between search and financial frictions. Then, we build a stylized DSGE model that features this channel. Simulation excercises show that the model with this channel generates a strong internal propagation mechanism, replicates stylized labor market effects of the Great Recession, and, most importantly, creates a jobless recovery.Nice to see a paper that ties together the jobless recoveries of the last few cycles with the financial frictions that have been so important in the last one.Share this:TwitterFacebookMoreEmailRedditPrintTumblrLinkedInLike this:Like Loading...RelatedThis entry was posted on Thursday, February 16th, 2017 at 4:31 pm and is filed under Uncategorized.
