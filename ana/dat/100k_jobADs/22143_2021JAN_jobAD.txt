Suicide doesn't solve problems. Condolence to his family members. May his soul rest in peace. D M'sian govt shouldn't extend d RMCO, which wl create more unemployment, mental health problems, loss of business and more bankruptcies. Does it justify to shut down d country's economy just because of a small no. of people having a viral infection? D Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 killed some 50 million people bt no shutting down of economy by countries thn. So no unprecedented economic collapses like what's happening nw. Leaders of countries should reflect and have d courage to do what's right for their country n people. May God bless everyone.ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAdd commentLoad more...Popular PostsSriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 crashes five minutes after take-off from Jakarta Airport, Indonesia - Aero WorldJanuary 09, 2021Air Canada Boeing 737 MAX Suffers Inflight Engine Shutdown, Forced to Divert - Aero WorldDecember 27, 2020World's Most Lavish Qatari Boeing 747-8 Private Jet On Sale (Features, Aircraft Tour)July 09, 2020A British Pilot Who Murdered His One-Year-Old Daughter Has Been Jailed For 20 Years - Aero WorldDecember 28, 2020A Former AirAsia Pilot Commited Suicide After Losing His JobAugust 06, 2020Search This BlogFeatured Postbest airlinesTop 10 Best Airlines for 2020by Aero World - December 29, 2019Air New Zealand is the Airline of the year for 2020 according to the Western Australia bas…Read moreWikipediaSearch resultsArchive202112020153201912Popular PostsWorld's Most Lavish Qatari Boeing 747-8 Private Jet On Sale (Features, Aircraft Tour)July 09, 2020A Former AirAsia Pilot Commited Suicide After Losing His JobAugust 06, 2020Air Canada Boeing 737 MAX Suffers Inflight Engine Shutdown, Forced to Divert - Aero WorldDecember 27, 2020Airbus A350 & A330 Can Now Be Converted For Pure Cargo Operations In 2 DaysMay 01, 2020Email SubscriptionEnter your email address:Delivered by FeedBurnerAirbus, Boeing, Aviation News, Aviation, Aero World,Aero WorldAirbusBek AirBoeinglongest flight in the worldmissile hitting ukranian planeMenu Footer WidgetHomeAboutContact UsCrafted with by Aero WorldⒸ Aero World| Keep SupportingPowered by Blogger"
