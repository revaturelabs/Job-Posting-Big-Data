If you don‚Äôt know, I am in school. If you haven‚Äôt yet, check out my post all about my life at college. Coming to terms with the fact that school must come first has been really hard for me. Even though blogging is one of my jobs, getting through college is the job I cannot neglect. I hate to say that I neglect my blog, but to be honest this quarter has taken a lot out of me, and when I do have a moment of down time I have learned that I need to use it to recoup for my own mental sake. That being said, I am beyond happy the quarter is almost done. I am officially done on December 6th and of course what am I doing the day after? Going to NYC, of course! The moment I can start focusing on what I love again, I don‚Äôt hesitate.Back to the title of this blog post, I swear it wasn‚Äôt just click bait. As a junior in college there is a lot of pressure to find internships, jobs, have your life together, make money, and be successful, most of which I am very confident about. The one thing that had been hard for me the past couple months is hearing professors say you need experience to put on your resume, meaning jobs and internships. As a blogger I know I have had SO many experiences and real experience in the field, but none that is your traditional resume material like ‚Äúinterned at Nordstrom.‚Äù I know I have gained so many skills and a great knowledge base thus far, but I couldn‚Äôt get over the fact that I didn‚Äôt have a resume like everyone else; mine was different because most of what I have done has been working for myself. Thinking about it now, I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.In the midst of anxiety and panic about how am I ever supposed to find an internship or a job, I found my dream position. Before all of this, I had really started to lean into God and realign my focus on what really is important in this life. I took my fear and stress to Him.‚Ä¶a little back story. I have gone to Christian school my whole life and I have always had a relationship with The Lord. I go in and out of focusing on building that relationship that I know deep down is really important. It can be hard and often I find myself only realigning in the midst of hurt, anxiety, or desperation. #realtalk. A couple months ago though I decided to make it a goal of mine to really put that first in my life. After all, you can‚Äôt cultivate a relationship if you aren‚Äôt putting any effort in, same goes for God. So, that was my goal for myself.So, I took my anxiety and stress to God about this whole finding a job thing and I really asked Him what was meant for me and why have I been placed in the position I am in. I have learned over the years that asking for what I want is not the right question to ask, so instead I pray for clarity, understanding, and grace. Fast forward a couple weeks later and I am invited to an event for Butter London. I actually wasn‚Äôt able to make the official event but they invited me in earlier to check out the new salon and get a manicure. I met the marketing director and we got to talking and it resulted in a job! So, I am now working for Butter London on their influencer marketing team and I LOVE it. I knew I really wanted to focus on influencer marketing but thought I would have to start out just in basic marketing with a company not necessarily in the fashion or beauty industry. It was EXACTLY what I was wanting and I am beyond happy. What are the chances?You could easily say that I made that come to life through my own ability and the path I have created for myself, but I firmly believe that God had the upper hand in it all. It was such a reminder to me that He really does listen to me and he always will provide whether that be what I want, or something I will learn to love. I just wanted to share that little story with you since I don‚Äôt really go into things like this. May it be encouragement for you, a reminder, or even just a fun little story.Thank you so much for taking the time to read my thoughts and allow me to share these things with you.
