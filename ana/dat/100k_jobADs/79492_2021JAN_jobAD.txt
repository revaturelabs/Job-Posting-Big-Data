Here are a few more ideas to get you in the mood which Earnshaws Fencing Centres can help you create.Help the bees!We all like to feed the birds, but have you ever thought about helping our declining bee population? The lesser known mason bee is a solitary insect, and during springtime the female needs a particular environment in order to lay eggs – a bee hotel! All that you need is four planks of untreated wood made into a frame and plenty of hollow stems (from bramble, reed or bamboo) to fill it with. See more details on how to build your own bee hotel here.Decorate your garden with containers!One of the easiest ways to brighten up your garden area is to use planters, which can filled with many species of plant life from seasonal to permanent, herbs or even small trees! We supply a range of timber planters at Earnshaws Fencing Centres for you to choose from. See here for further details.Build a compost cafe!By making your own compost heaps, not only are you helping reduce landfill sites but you’re also providing a place of shelter and food for small mammals such as hedgehogs, as they can’t resist a fat slug or juicy beetle for lunch! To help get you started we supply a range of composts at Earnshaws Fencing Centres including farm manure, wood chips and forest mulch. You can see details and prices here.To see these ideas and more check out the ‘Things to do’ page on the National Gardening Week official website here.Posted by Earnshaws on 16-Apr-2015Brands We Stock...ProductsFencingTimberGatesDeckingGarden LandscapingSheds & CabinsGarden FurnitureFirewoodFittings & ToolsQuick LinksPrice ListsLoyalty CardVideosDownloadsNewsAbout EarnshawsEarnshaws HistoryServicesOur CentresVacanciesContactTrade ServicesOpening Hourstoday 01 autumn 10 spring 03October - FebruaryMidgley CentreWeekdays: 8:00am – 4:30pmSat: 8:30am – 4:30pmSun: 10:00am – 4:00pmWentworth CentreWeekdays: 8:00am – 4:30pmSat: 8:30am – 12:30pmSun: CLOSEDBrigg CentreWeekdays: 8:00am – 4:30pmSat: 8:30am – 4:30pmSun: CLOSEDVisit Our Ebay ShopKeep In TouchVisit Our CentresWest Yorkshire CentreStocksmoor Road,Midgley, Wakefield, WF4 4JGCall: 01924 830055Serving Wakefield, Huddersfield, Holmfirth and DewsburySouth Yorkshire CentreBarrowfield Lane,Wentworth, Rotherham, S62 7TPCall: 01226 742206Serving Barnsley, Rotherham, Sheffield and StocksbridgeNorth Lincolnshire CentreBridge Street,Brigg, DN20 8NQCall: 01652 653165Serving Scunthorpe, Grimsby, Gainsborough and Market RasenAll of our centres accept:FAQsSitemapTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCOVID Risk Assessments© 2021 Job Earnshaw & Bros.
