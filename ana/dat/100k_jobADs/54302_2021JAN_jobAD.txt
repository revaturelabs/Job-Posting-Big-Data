Claims may also further clarify parts of other claims (e.g., dependent claims). Initial rough claims are written to describe the important characteristics of intellectual property that will be examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Finalized claims provide the framework for legal arguments (Patent Defense and Patent Prosecution) and help determine marketability (Freedom to Operate).The number of claims can vary (Design and Plant patents can have just 1 claim along with a figure) and require at least 1 broad (independent) claim followed by several narrow (dependent) claims that pertain to the IP. Claims can define the method of use for the invention (utility) and what the invention is made of (composition).The ProcessReview Invention Disclosure.Draft Rough Claims from Invention Disclosure.Perform a prior art search using rough claims.Perform patentability analysis using rough claims.Finalize claims and submit U.S. Provisional Patent Application.The ExerciseRough claims are written using information from the client’s invention disclosure. Your task is to draft and write a description and claim(s) section pertaining to your client’s IP. This will include a description of the object or method along with claims, and at least 1 independent claim. You will need to familiarize yourself with your client’s IP and the terms-of-art (ToA) of the field. These ToA can be used in your claims and will be included in the mock invention disclosure form. For this exercise, you are an intern for a patent attorney.Task 1: Draft rough claimsStep 2 from the process. Draft between 5 to 20 rough claims for your client who wants to patent a new method to use an inhibitor that they have been researching, fidgetin-like 2. For this task, write at least 1 independent claim that identifies the important characteristics of said object or method, and several dependent claims. Remember, claims can define utility and composition.Imagine you were writing claims for a pita sandwich. It would look something like:What is claimed is:(Independent) A sandwich comprising of: a first bread layer, a filling, and a second bread layer.(Dependent) The sandwich of claim 1, wherein the filling is adjacent to the first bread layer and the second bread layer.(Dependent) The sandwich of claim 2, wherein the filling is edible.(Dependent) The sandwich of claim 3, where in the filling comprises a meat, a sauce, a cheese, and at least one vegetable.Etc.Below are the IP links that you will need:Real Fidgetin-like2 patent, filed 2012Real Fidgetin-like2 patent, filed 2014Real Fidgetin-like2 patent, filed 2016The DeliverableThe deliverable will be a mock patent description (background section only) along with claims. Generally, the description comes after the claims. A statement such as “What is claimed is:” precedes the claims which are numbered. Examples are shown. Focus on the claims and description sections. Do not worry about the summary of invention, figures section, or data section.Sample Deliverables:Coming soon!Resources:Patent it yourself, slides by David Pressman – introduction to intellectual property and practical guidanceHow to read a patent by Way Better PatentsLinks for patent databasesUS Patent and Trademark OfficeGoogle PatentsUSPTO Manual for Patent Examining Procedures (MPEP) Guidelines on UtilitySkills used to perform this task:StrategyMarket researchTechnical writingSkills used in this field:Technical expertise (STEM field)Legal complianceProject managementCollaborating with clientsDealing with conflictTo view detailed lists of skills in job descriptions for policy careers, please see workforce data generated by Boston University’s BEST program.Additional responsibilitiesA professional in the field of intellectual property may also perform these activities:Patentability searchesPerform due diligenceFreedom to operate analysesInterview scientists about their technologiesRead more about careers in intellectual property and patent law in this resource generated by Duke University.You are viewing a job simulation.
