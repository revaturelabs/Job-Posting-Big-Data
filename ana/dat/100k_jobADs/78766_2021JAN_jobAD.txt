They come in compact, efficient sizes that allow you to easily maneuver in any tight space in your yard.The key to getting the best bang for your buck is in knowing what features you need to make your lawn look its absolute best.If you intend to use mulch in your yard and add back vital nutrients to the soil for a more healthy and greener lawn, then a mower with mulching abilities is a must. Something else to consider is whether or not a side discharge option is important and whether or not you need a rear collection bag.Many manufactures of small mowers have combined all three cutting systems and offer them as a part of the complete package on their mowers.Husqvarna 7021PFor homeowners looking to purchase small lawn and garden equipment, powerful, more compact models like the Husqvarna 7021P stand out at the top the list. These types of models are just the right fit for homeowners who have just enough yard to do the job themselves, but not enough to warrant hiring a landscaper.Nowadays, the familiar old term of “horsepower” has been replaced by the term “torque” when it comes to discussing engines.Horsepower is no longer the gold standard for describing the power of a small gasoline engine powered motor. Instead, you’ll find most push lawn mowers rated by torque. Torque is a simple way to measure the force required to turn something, namely a lawn mower blade.Most will find that it’s a better way to measure a lawn mower’s ability to cut grass. With all this in mind, you can make smarter decisions when it comes to choosing the better, smaller version of a push mower to cut your grass this season.What Do Real People Say About The Small Lawn Mower?A small lawn mower like the Husqvarna 7021P walk behind mower can turn out to be an exceptional model that can help you to produce an exceptional yard.

It starts easily and rolls smoothly and easily; is easier to push than my previous push-mower; & has plenty of power. It is simple to switch from using the bag attachment to the mulching function, too. I’m not 100 percent sure the plastic wheels will last for a bunch of years, but the big rear wheels do help me maneuver the mover with little effort. The mower has been a great investment so far.”– Richard (Testimony from amazon.com)“The mower looked great and fired right up. I won’t be using it until the Spring, but I was very impressed with how easy it starts, and also how well balanced it is. I never realized how heavy and unbalanced my old mower was until I got this one. Bang for the buck, with a Honda motor, I would definitely recommend it.”– M.M. (Testimony from amazon.com)What Else Should You Know About The Small Lawn Mower?Aside from must-have features like fine mulching, rear collection and side discharge, your small lawn mower should also have the kind of handle that makes folding easy for storage and quick transportation.
