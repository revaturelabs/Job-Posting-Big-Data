Our hands are our primary tool at our disposal, where they’re used to drive our cars, type on our computers, and use our tools on the construction site. Nearly every task we perform requires the use of our hands. With such an important function to our daily routine, it’s imperative to protect our hands from environmental and work hazards with the right equipment.Hand ProtectionAccording to the CDC, 70% of workers who injure their hands are not wearing gloves. Of every hand injury, two in every five hand injuries are from cuts and punctures. On the jobsite, there are many hazards that can injure our hands in the form of cuts, bruises, and lacerations. Wearing the proper gloves on site will help prevent hand injuries from occurring. Gloves are so effective, that overall risk of injury is reduced by 60% when wearing the proper gloves.Ergodyne730 Proflex Hand Fire RescueKeep Your Hands Safe from FrostbiteIf you have to work outside in the winter, chances are your hands will get cold pretty quickly. It is important to wear warm gloves during the winter months, where temperatures will go below the freezing point and precipitation will be primarily snow and sleet. If your hands are exposed to the cold for too long, you could get frostbite. Frostbite is when the outer layers of your body, primarily the skin, literally freeze from being exposed to cold temperatures. If you feel a tingling sensation in your hands, find warmth for them immediately. This is the first stage of frostbite, referred as frostnip, which won’t cause any serious or permanent damage to the hands. Later stages will require a medical visit and surgery to remove the affected parts of your hands. Make sure your gloves keep your hands warm enough over a long period of time. It is also helpful to wear gloves that are waterproof, especially if there is ice or snow on the jobsite.Prevent Cuts and BruisesWearing gloves can help prevent you from getting cuts or bruises on your hands. On the jobsite, hazards such as misuse of equipment to environmental factors play a risk to cuts and bruises. Be sure to wear the right gloves with the proper cut resistance level. This rating scale is from 1-to-5 and is determined by the greatest risk to your hands. the higher the level, the greater the risk and the more cut resistant the glove is.What Type of Gloves Do I Need?Many people do not know what type of gloves they should be wearing.

Consider if you need gloves with a firm grip, as gloves come in a variety of grip strengths and will prove vital when operating hand tools or carrying equipment. Make sure that your gloves allow you the level of dexterity that you need to get your job done safely. A high-dexterity glove will improve the handling of tools while wearing gloves, and create a greater sense of control while wearing them. Also, consider the temperature of your site when choosing a glove. Winter weather requires heavier gloves to protect from the cold, while warmer weather allows the use of thinner gloves but with dexterity and cut resistant grades. If you are going to being wearing gloves for a long period of time, you will want to choose the right pair of gloves that provide the most protection and comfort while at work.Purchase Gloves From SSUPrev 1 of 1 NextSSU GETS GOOD GLOVESWhether indoors or outdoors, keep your hands safe throughout the winter.
