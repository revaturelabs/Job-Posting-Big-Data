A creative director must be an accomplished juggler, nimbly switching between projects with big picture overview as well as careful attention to detail. They‚Äôre often the face of the studio, pitching to and liaising with clients, before developing a vision and relaying it back to their team of designers. The role requires you to be an eternal fountain of ideas that can quickly sketch out numerous routes in response to a brief, steering a project back on track when it starts falling apart. Depending on level, a creative director will also head overall studio strategy, with all the responsibilities ‚Äì and paperwork ‚Äì that running a successful business requires.Please Note: The world of creative careers is broad and ever-evolving. While our descriptions aim to capture the essence of a role, we appreciate that no two jobs will be the same. We‚Äôre always looking to grow, expand and add to these roles, so if you feel we are missing something please let us know!Creative LivesCreative LivesFind what you care about and stand up for it: Global Brand Narrative Director at Nike, Lydia Pang09 September 2020Creative LivesAdidas designer Nick Hussain explains how moving from London to rural Germany redefined his career05 December 2019Creative LivesMultidisciplinary creative Daniel Baragwanath on art directing for Dua Lipa and developing 3D code26 September 2019Creative LivesKitsch, colour and humour: Inside Charlotte Audrey‚Äôs whimsical creative direction17 July 2019Creative LivesHow to design for meditation: Designer Anna Charity on developing the Headspace brand30 January 2019Creative LivesMahaneela: ‚ÄúThe idea of being good at one thing is redundant now‚Äù18 September 2018Creative LivesWell-timed emails and helicopter photoshoots: Associate creative director Mark Lee‚Äôs road to Uniform15 August 2018Creative LivesBrand consultant and ping pong specialist Algy Batten on closing one business to start a very different one16 May 2018Creative LivesDon‚Äôt accept average: Greenspace creative director Lee Deverill02 May 2018Creative LivesUniversal Everything founder Matt Pyke: From designing album covers to lighting up Sydney Opera House13 November 2017Creative Lives‚ÄúSurround yourself with people better than you‚Äù Sam Wilkes, packaging creative director at LOVE24 October 2017Creative LivesGetting things started: co-founder and director of Warriors Studio, Beth Wilson27 September 2017Creative LivesCreative director and Fiasco Design co-founder Ben Steers on pitching, persistence and making your own job13 September 2017Creative LivesLondon-based creative director and designer Bruce Usher on running his own one-man studio02 May 2017Creative LivesCreative director, studio founder and lecturer Craig Oldham: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not enough to just make things look good‚Äù25 April 2017Creative LivesDiscovery is not desk-bound for TEMPLO‚Äôs intrepid creative director, Pali Palavathanan18 April 2017Creative LivesCreative director Charlotte Heal on discovering the missing link between graphic design and photography20 March 2017Creative LivesNB Studio creative director Nick Finney on ‚Äòcreative courage‚Äô and twenty years in the design biz14 March 2017Creative LivesCreative director at Sunhouse Creative James Giles: ‚ÄúMaster being a great designer, the rest will just fall into place‚Äù10 March 2017Creative LivesCreative Director Jaco Justice: ‚ÄúClients don't think like you.
