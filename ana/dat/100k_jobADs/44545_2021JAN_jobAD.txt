He said this will make the lower rung cops understand their duties and remain aware about measures to be taken while investigating or pursuing any case till the end, including the judicial proceedings.He said it has been seen in the Bikru case that negligence and lacklustre approach as well as unawareness about their duties helped Dubey carry out his nefarious activities despite being convicted in a murder case and having multiple case registered against him.He said the suggestion to the state government was to ask the rules and manuals wing of the state police to prepare a handbook about police functioning. The official said the handbook should also be included in the recruitment training process as well.The SIT member said another suggestion was to prepare a job chart for constable to ADG rank officials to fix accountability in case of any incident.He said SIT found in the enquiry that every officer tried to pass the buck on to the other in taking action against Dubey and his gang. He said the job chart should have detailed work profile of everybody from top to bottom in the police department.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ONTopicsHandbook SIT recommendation Kanpur ambushOPEN APPThis site uses cookiesThis site and its partners use technology such as cookies to personalize content and ads and analyse traffic.
