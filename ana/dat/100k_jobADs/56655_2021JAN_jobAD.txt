Can you lead and develop a team of Quality, Health and Safety and GDPR / RP compliance specialists across a number of sites in the UK to deliver a best in class level of Quality and Compliance for the organisation? This will be a highly visible and key role within the UK arm of a global business that gives compliance across its organisation the highest level of support and influence.The Head of Quality and Compliance will be a leadership position within the organisation and reports directly to the UK MD and with a dotted line into the VP of Europe and will lead a motivated and experienced team in order to deliver the appropriate level of Quality and Compliance across the operation while being the Responsible Person (RP) and Data Protection Officer (DPO) in charge of GDPR for the business. You will ensure the company is conforming to all aspects of Quality and Compliance within the pharmaceutical and medical device healthcare industry, leading the systems, methods and processes in accordance with regional and global requirements. This is a proactive role, ensuring that both the company and its employees are competently trained, educated and compliant within the relevant regulation frameworks and will also be the point of contact with Customers, Clients and EU residents, supervisory authorities and internal teams.Midlands based but with travel across both the UK and Ireland and perhaps on occasion into Europe, flexibility and an ability to be both hands on and strategic where required will be a significant challenge in this role. The incumbent will be required to have working knowledge of General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018, Information Security Management (ISMS), Be-Trade along with all other compliance requirements for the business. As Health and Safety will report into this role, there will be overarching responsibility for this in terms of compliance but it will not need to form a part of the daily tasks for this individual.Coming from a healthcare / pharmaceutical background is a must in this post due to the nature of being the RP for the business and a good understanding of both quality systems and audits for ISO9001 will be essential. Best practice and legal compliance will be the daily tools of your trade and you will need to rally the support of the other teams within the business in order to deliver against both the clients and the internal best in class compliance expectations.Hands on systems and quality process skills coupled with a level of energy and determination will be the key assets of the post holder in this case and a strategic mindset to deliver against the companies targets and expectations will be key. This role will be highly autonomous and so an ability to develop your team and drive for results is critical.If you feel that you have the required skills and approach to add value in this exciting and challenging role within a successful global organisation then please contact Matt Harris to discuss in more detail.By applying you will be registered as a candidate with Gleeson Recruitment Limited.
