Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” ― Howard Thurmandetroit20Posted: June 11, 2018 10:46 AMPermalinkIsn't Lion to you.London, UKAgreed. That looks like another iteration of the 'Souls' formula.A couple of observations:There was no HUD visible in the gameplay footage, so it's not clear to me what the combat system actually is. I didn't play Dark Souls 3, but I understand that there were three gauges to manage: HP; magic/battle and stamina. I'd actually welcome something a little less complicated this time around.There was no indication of any multiplayer elements. I've certainly welcomed having the ability to summon help in previous Souls games when I've reached the limits of either my abilities or my patience. No co-op might be a deal-breaker for me. I'm not a nightly gamer anymore, so I don't think I'd ever finish a single-player only Souls game.PSN: Detroit20HobearPosted: June 11, 2018 2:22 PMPermalinkSmarter than the average Bear….HoPraise the SunCertis wrote:Watch when he pushes open a big door.

There are no stats to level up and no armor or weapons to collect and equip. There are no classes to choose from. There is no multiplayer of any kind. You'll have no souls to reclaim after dying, and—from the looks of it—no checkpoint bonfires to kindle.Not to say it wont be good or anything, but definitely a larger departure from Soulsborne than it initially seemed like.This is very much in line with rumors before E3 though. Rumors that also said there was another actual souls-like in development at From, so hope wont dieMore stuff:Kill Ingeniously – From Software delivers their best in class combat in this fast-paced, action-adventure game featuring all new mechanics.Exploration is key – Players will experience the thrill of exploration and discovery in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice like never before. Through exploration, players can uncover new items, meet new characters, and encounter hidden enemies.Armed – Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice gameplay is centered around sword combat, enhanced by a variety of prosthetic arm attachments that supplement or change the way a player fights. Achieving strategic mastery of “Sekiro” or the “one-armed wolf’s” techniques and abilities, from prosthetic tools, swordplay to stealth and the grappling hook is no easy feat. To overcome difficulties and bring each situation under control, gamers must discover, integrate and use a variety of new tools when heading into combat.One-armed wolf – Play as a highly talented shinobi in the service of a young lord raised in isolation. After suffering defeat at the hands of a shadowy Ashina samurai seeking the unique heritage of your master, the two of you are separated. Deep in the mountains, in a dilapidated temple, you reawaken to your fate. You must take back your master and exact revenge on your enemy at all costs.Hard to the core – Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a hard-core game worthy of the name From Software. Miyazaki designed Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice this way! Fans of From Software will find the gameplay challenging, yet fun and rewarding. The quality of combat, level of challenge, and creative enemies and bosses are something that can only be found in a From Software title.Reimagined world – This reimagining of Japanese aesthetic blends a withered, yet vivid, world of the late 1500s Sengoku Japan as the age of warring states nears its end. Witness a world brought to its knees by constant bloodshed; a ravaged world on the brink of destruction. Explore these environments, rich with FromSoftware’s intricate design and steeped with secrets to discover.TheGameguruPosted: June 12, 2018 9:45 PMPermalinkHere to save you allPistolvaniaThere are no stats to level up and no armor or weapons to collect and equipThrough exploration, players can uncover new items, meet new characters, and encounter hidden enemies.Huh?

But not weapons, armors etc. that all serve the same purpose, but have different stats.But who knows what it really means. Like in Bloodborne you had the runes which essentially was a replacement of rings. Could easily have buffs and what not that replaced the concept of weapons and armors. But if the goal is not to have those things... maybe not. Bloodborne already took one step in that direction, by mostly removing spells and shields as well as reducing the significance of armor, so it doesn't seem that surprising.I dont mind From experimenting at all. Just so few developers making this type of game (and the few that does, haven't been particularly succesful at it), so would be really sad if they completely abandoned it.What I might miss most actually might not be the weapons/armors themselves, but a potentially lowered reward for exploration. Gear serves that purpose nicely.TheGameguruPosted: June 12, 2018 10:19 PMPermalinkHere to save you allPistolvaniaShadout wrote:I saw one place comparing it to earlier zelda or metroid games or similar, where you find different tools that open up new and distinct gameplay aspects.

In some ways it does seem more \"actiony\" with the grapple hook and jumping around. It does look cool though and if they can marry the deep combat with some more \"flash\" then color me intrigued.Aint nothing new about the world order..it's been playing since the day they put George Washington on a quarterDelivering Truth while the 10% deliver lies.DyniPosted: June 13, 2018 3:01 PMPermalinkMight makes RightFirelink ShrineUSGamer has put up a couple pieces with great info, including an interview with Miyazaki.https://www.usgamer.net/articles/sek...https://www.usgamer.net/articles/sek...This bit about the combat stood out to me:In terms of combat, the idea is not to gradually chip down your opponent's health. It's a battle of postures. And so the idea is to wear down their posture, throw them off balance, and look for that one single opening—that one single chink in the armor—and lay in the finishing blow. So that's the general approach of this combat system.Sounds awesome.I need an \"I'm with Dyni\" t-shirt. -- Localgod54ShadoutPosted: June 13, 2018 4:18 PMPermalinkNo More Mister Spice GuyDenmarkHm. Not like combat in Souls was about gradually chipping down health - outside of bosses. They were more like, hit enemy 1-3 times during an opening in their attack pattern.It sounds annoying if all normal enemies would be 'I got to wear down their posture before I can actually hurt them'. Would be extremely different at least. And not exactly more 'actiony'.If he is talking bosses/harder enemies, sure, it is another story, which sounds good. Wouldn't be that different either, plenty of Souls bosses got backstab or stun opportunities where you could deal a lot of dmg with a single attack.Anything From is day 1 for me in any case, at least until they fool me onceCptDomanoPosted: June 13, 2018 5:03 PMPermalinkOne Classy LaddyMichiganDyni wrote:USGamer has put up a couple pieces with great info, including an interview with Miyazaki.https://www.usgamer.net/articles/sek...https://www.usgamer.net/articles/sek...This bit about the combat stood out to me:In terms of combat, the idea is not to gradually chip down your opponent's health.

Pretty interesting to see Miyazaki zig while the rest of the industry zags again. Everyone else is putting RPG mechanics on top of every genre? Whelp, time to make one without.Did anyone ask someone from From Software why Activision is publishing this game? Wasn't the main reason for Kadokawa's acquisition of From Soft to make a big investment into their games publishing?WCG USA 2005Pages123456789…next ›last »You are hereHome » Forums » Games and Platforms"
