To promote these opportunities Prosper Portland has adopted the Business and Workforce Equity Policy. The Business and Workforce Equity Policy encompasses two programs: The Business Equity Program (formerly the Good Faith Effort program) and the Workforce Equity Program (principally, the Workforce Training and Hiring Program).Business Equity ProgramProsper Portland's Business Equity Program is a commitment of outreach to the minority, women and emerging small business communities. The purpose of the program is to ensure that Prosper Portland contracts provide business opportunities for minority, women and emerging small businesses in order to promote economic growth, to increase capacity and to expand competition in the marketplace.Workforce Training and Hiring ProgramProsper Portland's Workforce Training and Hiring Program requires training on Prosper Portland-funded construction projects to ensure that Prosper Portland-funded projects offer equal opportunity in employment and that those who have been historically underused in the construction trades have access to jobs through training programs. Both of these programs have specific requirements.Prosper Portland is committed to expending public funds in a manner that benefits the entire community. Qualified Minority Business Enterprises/Women Business Enterprises and Emerging Small Businesses (M/W/ESB) are determined by certification criteria established by the State of Oregon Office of Minority, Women, & Emerging Small Business (OMWESB), which administers the certification programs. These programs are designed to promote targeted economic opportunities for small businesses in the state.DocumentsMinority Evaluator ProgramProsper Portland invites people of color to participate in the Minority Evaluator Program, designed to ensure Portland’s diverse communities are represented on Prosper Portland’s evaluation committees for Requests For Proposals (RFPs).As a person of color in the community, you bring a diverse perspective and experience, and will provide valuable input to the City of Portland and Prosper Portland Contract Award Process. For more information please visit the Minority Evaluator Program website, where you can apply to participate online, or download a brochure (PDF).Opportunities in the Construction TradesIf you are interested in working in the construction trades, it is important that you contact a trade organization or union to learn more about apprenticeship training programs and requirements for participation.Information on the construction trades and the current status of apprenticeship programs is available at the Bureau of Labor & Industry's (BOLI) website. You can listen to a recorded message with updated information on openings in the Portland area by contacting BOLI's Apprenticeship and Training Division at 503-731-4200, ext. 3, then dial 5001.For individuals considering work in the trades, Prosper Portland's Workforce Training and Hiring program requires training on Prosper Portland-funded construction projects to ensure that Prosper Portland-funded projects offer equal opportunity in employment and that those who have been historically underused in the construction trades have access to jobs through training programs. This program does have specific requirements for participation.MWESB Community ResourcesAfrican American Chamber of Commerce of OregonRoy Jay, President4300 NE Fremont #220Portland, OR503-244-5794www.blackchamber.infoAsian Pacific American Chamber of CommerceP.O.
