When we read through our 30 year Archives, it is sometimes sad and frustrating how little has changed and other times it is comforting and thought-provoking how consistent some things remain.Still today attitude and communication are foundations to success in the work place.In this issue Back Talk I would like to spend some time looking at attitudes and how attitudes affect our ability to get or hold a job.Our attitudes, positive or negative, are like a mirror that reflects what our experiences have been. Someone displaying an attitude such as “the world sucks” or “you can’t trust anyone” is really making a statement about what their past experience has been. Attitudes like these then become a prediction of what their past experience has been. Attitudes like these then become a prediction of what the future holds. And sure enough, if you go around think and acting like the world sucks, the other people in it may not always be the kind and caring souls you were hoping to meet.A recent survey of employers by the federal government contained some surprising results. One of the most surprising answers from employers concerned the reason most often cited for firing employees. The number one reason for firing employees was not lack of skills or inability to do the job…it was having a bad attitude.Think about it…many of us will realize how vital our attitudes are to work – as well as to the rest of our lives. Negative attitudes help create a dark and depressing view of the future. They make us a drag to be around. Worse, they rob us of excitement and confidence in our lives. Positive attitudes make things more fun and make us more fun to be around. They help us cope with disappointments and difficulties.Attitudes are learned; they are ways of thinking that develop as a result of past experiences. They affect the way we think, act and feel. A positive attitude can make the workday pass more quickly and pleasantly. A person with a cheerful attitude makes things easier for others they work with.Attitudes are particularly important during job interviews. The interviewer must make a decision about whether to hire someone or not after a very brief discussion. A negative attitude will eliminate you from consideration faster than bad breath.Does all this talk about attitudes sound too simple? That’s because, like most common sense things, it is simple. If you feel good about yourself and other people you will have more success than if you feel shitty about yourself and consider other people jerks.Receive Blog Posts Directly to Your Inbox* indicates requiredFirst NameLast NameEmail Address *I’m interested in:Important News and EventsBlog NotificationsWeekly Participant Quote (select either weekly or monthly)Monthly Participant Quotes (select either weekly or monthly)Share:You May Also LikeImpact Storythe doorwayyoung people at the doorwayKendra, a Recent Graduate Shares Why The Doorway Worked for herThe Doorway	December 16, 2020A look back.
