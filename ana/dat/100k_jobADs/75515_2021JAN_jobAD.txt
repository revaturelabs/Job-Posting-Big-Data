At 3.8 percent year over year in March, the growth rate of residential-construction jobs towers over the overall jobs growth rate of 1.4 percent. In the last two years construction has added 317,000 jobs to the economy, with over half of that increase occurring in the last six months, the White House said in a statement on the jobs report.Even still, the rate of construction job growth lags far behind growth in actual home construction — which was a whopping 28 percent year over year in February, according to the Census Bureau. Today, Trulia economist Jed Kolko offered an explanation for why this is:“A key reason for this seemingly slow rebound in construction jobs is that construction activity (in units or dollar value) fell much more than employment did after the housing bubble burst. Economists point to “labor hoarding”: firms often hold on to more workers than they need in temporary downturns if the cost of firing, rehiring, and retraining is high relative to keeping them on,” Kolko wrote in a blog post. “That means jobs declined less than construction activity during the bust and are therefore now rebounding less.”The number of construction jobs for every housing unit actually appears bloated, Kolko found. In February, there were about 3.7 jobs per unit, up 40 percent from a February 2001 level of 2.6 per unit, he said.As home construction continues to rise, the sector will continue to generate jobs, but the number of jobs per unit should gradually decline to pre-bubble levels, he said.“For builders who are reporting labor shortages today, that headache is likely to get worse, not better, as the recovery continues,” he added.Show Comments Hide CommentsCommentsSign up for Inman’s Morning HeadlinesWhat you need to know to start your day with all the latest industry developmentsSign me upSuccess!Thank you for subscribing to Morning Headlines.Read NextBuildersUpdate.com aims to get homebuilders, agents working together'Agent Shield' helps Realtors, homebuilders make peace8 ways homebuilders alienate agentsBack to topInmanAboutContactSupportAdvertiseSponsor ConnectCareersCode of ConductPrivacyTerms of UseProductsEmail NewslettersCommunityFacebook GroupsCoast to CoastAgent to AgentBroker to BrokerVendor to VendorContributor submissionsImage submissionsAwardsInman InnovatorsInman 101Inman InfluencersThe WrapEssential GuidesConnect Video©2021 Inman All Rights Reserved.×InmanpotLog inEmailPasswordForgot?Log inIf you created your account with Google or FacebookLog in with GoogleLog in with FacebookDon't have an account?Create an AccountForgot your password?No ProblemSimply enter the email address you used to create your account and click \"Reset Password\".
