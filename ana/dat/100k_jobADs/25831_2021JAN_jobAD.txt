Whether he was involved in the scheme is still under investigation and no decision has been made about bringing him to trial, a law enforcement official familiar with the case said Friday.Most readJust inJan. 26, 2021	Biden Signals Tougher U.S. Stance Against Russia in First Call With Putin	Jan. 26, 2021	G7 Foreign Ministers Condemn Navalny Arrest	Jan. 26, 2021	Russia Suggests Middle East Peace Conference	Jan. 26, 2021	Navalny's Team Plans Weekend Protests Outside FSB	Jan. 26, 2021	Real Life Meets Screen Life in Upcoming Russia-Based Thriller	1	russia's responseCoronavirus in Russia: The Latest News | Jan. 26	2	compromised contentSocial Media Platforms Delete Russian Posts Promoting Navalny Protests – State Censor	3	public oppositionAs It Happened: Tens of Thousands Rally for Navalny's Release Across Russia	4	weekend kitchenCopycat IKEA Meatballs5	FRIENDLY REMINDERMcKinsey Bans Moscow Staff From Attending Pro-Navalny Protest	Read more	NO RESET	Biden Signals Tougher U.S. Stance Against Russia in First Call With Putin	The new U.S. President highlighted concerns over the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and Russian \"aggression\" against Ukraine.politically motivatedG7 Foreign Ministers Condemn Navalny Arrest	The G7 said Navalny's detention was \"deplorable\" and called for his \"immediate and unconditional release.\"TWO STATE SOLUTIONRussia Suggests Middle East Peace Conference	Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov backed a Palestinian proposal for a Middle East peace conference later this year.SECOND RALLYNavalny's Team Plans Weekend Protests Outside FSB	Navalny accuses the FSB of carrying out a poisoning attack on him last year on Putin's orders.Independent journalism isn’t dead.
