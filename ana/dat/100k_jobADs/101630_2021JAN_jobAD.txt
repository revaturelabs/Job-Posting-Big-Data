The successful candidate will work in the framework of the BSM-Nu project funded by the Excellence Laboratory P2IO, which gathers neutrino experimentalists and phenomenologists in the Paris-Saclay area and aims at identifying hints of new physics in neutrino experimental data.The successful candidate is expected to devote a significant part of her/his work to the study of new physics effects in neutrino oscillation experiments, in collaboration with the IPhT theorists and the DUNE group of IJCLab. He/she will be based at IPhT and have the opportunity to interact with the neutrino theorists and experimentalists of the Paris-Saclay area, which are involved in oscillation (JUNO, T2K, DUNE, T2HK), neutrinoless double beta decay (CUPID) and coherent neutrino-nucleus elastic scattering (Ricochet, NUCLEUS) experiments.Application Materials Required:Submit the following items online at this website to complete your application:Cover letterCurriculum VitaeResearch statementPublication listThree reference letters (to be submitted online by the reference writers at this site )And anything else requested in the position description.Further Info:http://www.labex-p2io.fr/Phocea/Page/index.php?id=39Institut de Physique ThéoriqueCEA Saclay91191 Gif sur YvetteFranceNew Employer|View Jobs|Registered Employers|Contact Us© 2021 AcademicJobsOnline.Org.
