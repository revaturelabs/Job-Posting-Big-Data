I'm writing from Shift Learning. A market research ahgencey based in London, UK. We are currently working with a publisher looking at the usability of their website. I wish to invite you to take part in an online task looking at how easy the publishers website is to use. The task will involve you completing simple actions (such as searching for journals and looking for contact numbers) and we will use your responses to make suggestions on how the website could be improved. Your responses would be anonymous - it is the website we are testing and not you. The task would last for 1 hour and take place over the Internet using web conferencing software which is really quick and simple to use. This opportunity is only running over a short period of time - Don't miss out!
