"PokydorightPokydorightby John(Dallas)This is a sweetheart deal between paid off politicians and the railroad industry in the freight competition. Railroad execs are applauding the removal of as many long haulers possible. They're even buying up land for hundreds of hub to drop where the trucker is a hourly 26,000 class punk driver at half the wages. Follow the money, leads right from the railroad lobby to the sewers of Washington DC.And they are not done either, The Railroads have bought up fuel contracts that puts the airline business to shame at low prices while the politicians work to raise our fuel cost to assist in the \"change\". Over 300 billion has gone into rail infrastructure while the roads got pennies on the dollar even though our taxes and fees paid for road work.Watch for the result my friends.
