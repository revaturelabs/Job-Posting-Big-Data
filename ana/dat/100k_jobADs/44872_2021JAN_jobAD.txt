A postgraduate qualification has little effect on earning potential.While the traditional route for a creative director, namely a humanities degree and several years of hands-on experience, still holds true, graduates now come from a variety of creative backgrounds, management and technological roles.New job roles, such as content strategist, producer and app developer offer new routes to senior roles.

Work experience is a big part of this. Start by attending industry events open to students and networking with industry people. Running a well-read blog and speaking at industry events will also get you noticed.There is no formal, cross-industry scheme but short-term placement opportunities may be available. Contact individual agencies directly by sending a CV and cover letter.Demonstrating you're already practising in the area is vital. Consider developing your social media profile, your website or personal blog to give your online brand a more professional feel. Show your commitment while still at university by taking a communications role through the student union or other societies.Annual industry events, such as Advertising Unlocked, whereby top agencies open their doors, is a good way to make contacts. The National Advertising Benevolent Society (NABS) runs workshops for newcomers to the creative industries.AdvertisementEmployersCreative directors work at advertising agencies and also at in-house marketing departments of large companies.Employment opportunities and recruitment are handled by each individual agency. They have their own graduate recruitment schemes with applications at the start of the final year of study. Competition is fierce so apply early.Many graduates start out in advertising and marketing through internships. Once you've gained experience in an agency and built up a professional reputation and network of contacts, there may be opportunity for freelance work.Networking events and speculative applications, followed up by an informal face-to-face meeting, are established methods to find new opportunities, especially for senior roles.Look for job vacancies at:AdMissionCampaignThe Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM)Institute for Practitioners in Advertising (IPA)The DrumYou can also check university careers service vacancy lists and websites.

As a creative director it's most likely that you'll seek to either capitalise on strong international prospects or set up your own agency in collaboration with a finance director and chief executive.The opportunity to become a regional head of an agency to reinvigorate an established, or emerging, market is an attractive one. The advertising world still regards the UK as a centre of excellence and much client business is conducted in English. Singapore is the hub for Asia, although Shanghai is growing, while San Francisco and New York remain the American hubs.You could do a two-year stint in another market to broaden your experience and widen your perspectives within five years of joining an agency.In marketing, you could become a chief marketing officer (CMO), ultimately becoming the chief executive officer (CEO).In an editorial environment, you could become the creative director across a whole publishing group.Written by AGCAS editorsJanuary 2019© Copyright AGCAS & Graduate Prospects Ltd · DisclaimerSee how well you match this job profile and over 400 others.Try Career PlannerAlternative careersMedia plannerFilm directorArtworkerStylistTheatre managerTheatre stage managerHow would you rate this page?On a scale where 1 is dislike and 5 is likeSomething went wrong.
