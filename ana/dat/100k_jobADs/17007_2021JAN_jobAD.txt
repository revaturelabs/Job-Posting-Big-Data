Depending on the type, they’ll probably be too small to qualify for our free call out to quote for them – we simply charge for time spent at our standard rate, plus materials.Parts and supplies purchasesWe carry an extensive range of basic parts on our vans and try to aim to complete/fix most small jobs/faults in one visit. If the job/fault is more complex and we need to purchase extra materials, we inform you right away and we only charge for 1-hour max to purchase supplies. If materials need to be ordered in, we’ll inform you of what’s required, how much it will cost and organise a convenient time to return. If supplies are ordered, we ask for a deposit in advance.Pay on completionSmall jobs require a handover and payment on completion, so you’ll need to arrange for someone to be on hand to approve the finished works and provide payment by cash, cheque or card.Check out our ratesRepaired various light faults in the home – Steve was very helpful with my lighting problem. Fast, efficient and perfect.Razza Q KaderExcellent service from start to finish. On time, neat work and a friendly attitude. Would recommend and would use again without hesitation.Justin SamuelsWould highly recommend these guys they were so helpful and friendly but professional at the same time. They turned up on time, worked their way through what they had to do for me and the charges were exactly as laid out previously in their report so no nasty suprises! I had to pop out at one point and felt totally at ease leaving them in my home. Decent honest workers would use again.Sarah LinnellBook An EngineerServicesElectrical Repairs / Fault Finding	Testing and Inspecting	Consumer Unit (CU) / Fuse Board Installation	Rewiring	Emergency Lighting	Electrical Vehicle (EV) Charging Points	Fire Alarm Systems	Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR)	Domestic Electrical Installation Condition Report (DEICR)	Electrical Installation Certificate	PAT Testing	OUR GUARANTEEOur works come with a complete customer satisfaction 1 year guarantee and with a full six year NICEIC warranty.CONTACT INFO18 Valley Walk, Croydon CR0 8SRCall free 0800 644 4886info@cre8electricity.comMon - Sat 8.00 - 18.00 Sunday CLOSEDAboutWe are qualified, friendly electricians and plumbers in South London, helping Landlords, Local Businesses and Homeowners.Contact0800 644 4886info@cre8electricity.comMon - Sat 8.00 - 18.00Sunday CLOSEDServicesElectrical Repairs / Fault FindingTesting and InspectingFuse Board InstallationSmall JobsFire Alarm SystemsEmergency LightingElectrical Vehicle (EV) Charging PointsRewiringPlumbingOUR GUARANTEEOur works come with a complete customer satisfaction 1 year guarantee and with a full six year NICEIC warranty.Copyright © 2021 Cre8 Electricity Ltd.
