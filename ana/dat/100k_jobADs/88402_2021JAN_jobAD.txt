It currently conducts intense research in numerous fields of Condensed Matter Physics and Biophysics. Energy, transport, nanotechnology, health and environment, information and communication technologies are the key technologies of the twenty-first century. Condensed Matter Physics provides the methods to engineer and develop new ideas in most of these technologies. Using advanced instrumentation, such as state-of-the-art microscopy, spectroscopy, and calculation techniques, we can control and directly observe fascinating phenomena belonging to the challenges of technical development.Physics at UAM - World RankingsShanghaiRanking's Global Ranking of Academic Subjects 2017 - Physics: #51-75Nature Index 2017 - reflecting the quality of scientific research: #58About UsFind UsResearchAcademicsMembersContactGrants & JobsTweets by TwitterDevCopyright © 2021 - All rights reserved. - Department of Condensed Matter Physics - Faculty of Science, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain."
