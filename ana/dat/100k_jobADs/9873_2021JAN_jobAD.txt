While the response may differ from manager to manager and company, one constant holds true – employers want employees who are dependable, trustworthy, and good at their jobs. Great employees share certain characteristics and these are the ones that employers seek above and beyond the ability to fill a job description.

That's the day that bosses everywhere are nationally recognized for their efforts throughout the year. The history of Boss's Day began in 1958, when Patricia Bays Haroski registered 'National Boss' Day' with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Haroski was working as a secretary for St...Professions EmployeesProfessions EmployeesGive Grace During the Time of COVIDby Caroline Dowd-Higgins - September 18, 2020As we move into the 6-month mark recognizing how COVID-19 has changed our lives, the stress is palpable. Many parents and students are struggling with online learning, childcare, and trying to work from home while also supervising virtual education for young children. That challenge intensifies if those parents have returned to a place of work beyond the home.

To me, they just made perfect sense and those rare people whom I found to be great leaders were naturally applying these principles in their lives and work.

Unfortunately, it doesn't exist. This is not an alarmingly pessimistic point of view, but rather a real one. Every man and woman in the work force has different strengths, weaknesses, opinions, personalities, and an unfathomable amount of other characteristics that, when combined and utilized, can help in the search for a position that is a good fit.

The reality is - and will always be - that people make an assumption of you within the first few seconds you meet. This can include everything from the way you dress, to how you speak and your general attitude. At work, the first impression can not only impact short-term perceptions of you - but your long-term reputation and career success.

Such statements are being issued by public organizations, educational and nonprofit institutions, and for-profit companies. These statements are, sorry to say, generally mealy-mouthed in nature.
