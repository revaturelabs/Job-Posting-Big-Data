I thought it would make them happy.\"I have also had my lips done, ages ago, and won't do it again. I would only ever have plastic surgery again to get my breast implants removed. I do not like my boobs.\"Oetjen, whose season of The Bachelorette starts on October 10, now joins several other Bachie contestants who have spoken about their surgery regrets.Ali Oetjen.Fit star.Simone Ormesher, who appeared on both The Bachelor (2017) and Bachelor in Paradise (2018), told TV Week that she got breast implants because she lacked confidence.\"I wasn't feeling comfortable in myself so that's why I decided to get them done,\" she told the magazine. \"And actually my ex-boyfriend paid for them.\"Now I don't really like them anymore. My tops don't really fit me and I think natural looks better.\"Simone Ormesher. Source: Instagram @simone.ormesherBachelor in Paradise's Keira Maguire has been very open about her procedures, telling NW magazine that she's had a nose job and breast enlargement surgery.\"I was a little bit nervous, because with my nose job, I really, really, really wanted to get it done,\" she told the magazine. \"With my boobs though, I was like, 'Am I just taking it too far?' But then every time I looked down, I was like, 'I have no boobs!' and it kinda made me a little bit depressed.\"While she has no regrets about those procedures, Maguire does think she went too hard with lip filler before appearing on Bachelor in Paradise earlier this year.\"Maybe I had a bit too much lip filler before the show,\" she told The Daily Telegraph. \"I'm not going to deny it and I may have some regrets about it when I see it, but what am I going to do?\"Just casually chilling. Picture: @keiramaguireJust like Maguire, 2014 Bachelor star Laurina Fleure is a plastic surgery fan, but does regret getting one certain procedure done.\"I started off having my ears pinned back. I've had my breasts done. I've had scar augmentations on my tummy. I've had liposuction in my armpits to take away the perspiration glands so I don't sweat. And I have Botox as well,\" she previously told news.com.au\"My forehead still moves but the frown lines don't. I've had a peel. I am all for plastic surgery. I love it. I've got nothing to hide.\"But Fleure does regret getting breast implants.\"I went up from a B cup to a C cup and they are a little bit too big and aren't as natural looking as I would like,\" she told The Daily Telegraph.\"I am considering going back down to a B cup.\"Laurina Fleure on Bachelor in Paradise. Picture: Channel 10Last year's Bachelorette Sophie Monk, has also spoken of her cosmetic regrets in the past.\"I should have said no, but I trusted the doctor,\" she told Who magazine in 2011 about getting lip filler.Monk elaborated about the procedure in The Daily Telegraph, saying, \"I've admitted that I had a cyst removed from my lip and had it filled - I had to; the lip was half gone.\"I've tried Botox, but I don't do it any more. I'd tell anyone who's going to have it done not to do it. It doesn't look good and men don't find it attractive.\"Sophie Monk has had lip fillers and Botox.The Bachelorette Australia premieres on Wednesday, October 10 at 7.30pm only On TEN and WIN NetworkMore StoriesBig Brother contestant’s boob job nightmareModel’s attempt to have world’s biggest butt$3.5m lotto winner’s big regretBach contestant’s major interview blunderFans fume over ‘disgusting’ Bach premiereBusted: Ali’s secret kisses caughtBig Botox mistake Aussies are making‘I’ve got a panic button’: Sophie’s stalker hell‘I got dumped because of my implants’Show MoreHeadlinesPremium Content MP calls for minute silence on Australia Day4Premium Content Mum’s fraud betrays ‘heart and soul’ of community2ali oetjen bachelorette boob job plastic surgeryMore StoriesBig Brother contestant’s boob job nightmareModel’s attempt to have world’s biggest butt$3.5m lotto winner’s big regretBach contestant’s major interview blunderFans fume over ‘disgusting’ Bach premiereBusted: Ali’s secret kisses caughtBig Botox mistake Aussies are making‘I’ve got a panic button’: Sophie’s stalker hell‘I got dumped because of my implants’Show MoreSubscriber ExclusivesPremium Content ’We have lost a great man’: Sporting community in mourningNews The 83-year-old former Olympic cyclist died after a fallPremium Content Shock setback for gold mine west of CasinoNews Company has been working to “unlock the value” of the sitePremium Content 30 silos, almost 13m high, proposed for Ballina ShireNews The silos would be used for seasonal storage of local producePremium Content Why a medical cannabis pioneer is moving to the North CoastBusiness The cannabis oil manufacturer has its eye on possible opportunities in the local...Premium Content Strangers did non-stop CPR for 25 minutes to save man's lifeNews Paramedics were busy with another serious matter, but members of the public stepped...Premium Content Woman dismissed for refusing flu jabHealth Worker to pursue unfair dismissal case over flu jab19th Jan 2021 7:42 PMTop StoriesPremium Content Why Justin Langer and Aussie cricket team 'loved' my blogOpinion One phone call from Justin Langer made our sport reporter’s year … and it is only January.Premium Content Unhealthy truth about toddler snacks, milks19th Jan 2021 7:47 PMPremium Content Battered, broken and never beaten: India’s bravest warrior19th Jan 2021 7:39 PMPremium Content Confidence-crushed: How we lost the unlosable Test19th Jan 2021 7:37 PMDetail in Beckham photos send fans wild19th Jan 2021 6:51 PMContact Full Site TopDigital AdvertisingAdvertising TermsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseView our other news sitesDaily NewspapersBundaberg News-MailFraser Coast ChronicleGladstone ObserverGrafton Daily ExaminerGympie TimesIpswich Queensland TimesLismore Northern StarMackay Daily MercuryRockhampton Morning BulletinSunshine Coast DailyToowoomba ChronicleWarwick Daily NewsCommunity NewspapersBig RigsBallina Shire AdvocateBalonne BeaconBlackwater HeraldCentral & North Burnett TimesBiloela Central TelegraphByron Shire NewsCaboolture NewsChinchilla NewsCoffs Coast AdvocateCoolum & North Shore NewsDalby HeraldEast-Ipswich SatelliteEmerald Central Queensland NewsGatton StarIpswich AdvertiserIsis Town and CountryLogan ReporterNoosa NewsThe Northern Rivers EchoRange NewsRural WeeklySouth Burnett TimesStanthorpe Border PostSuratBasin.com.auTweed Daily NewsCharleville Western TimesRoma Western StarWhitsunday TimesWhitsunday Coast Guardian© Northern Star Ltd 2021.
