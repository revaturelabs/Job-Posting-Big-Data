I just don't find politics funny anymore,\" Paisley told Taste of Country ahead of the CMAs last month, noting those type of jokes are now \"off-limits\" for him. \"There was a time when it was. It's just not funny to me anymore.\"VideoHowever, not everyone in country music chooses to stick to entertaining — John Rich told us last week that he's a strong supporter of the Second Amendment and encouraged fellow artists who recently made a push for stricter gun laws to engage in a debate with him on the heated topic.\"Successful artists, while they're only one person, or a couple of people, whatever it is, they have millions of fans,\" the 44-year-old told Fox News exclusively, speaking of artists Dierks Bentley and Tyler Hubbard's call for more gun laws. \"So when they speak, those millions of fans hear what they say.\"Rich said he knows Bentley and Hubbard personally and has worked with them previously. He stressed that he has nothing but respect for them — but he does want to engage them in a conversation over gun control.Video\"The issue with gun control, you look at it and you go, 'These maniacs, these vicious people are taking a weapon and shooting people with it.' And then the flip side of that is, right now, I'm in New York City and back in Nashville is my wife and my two little kids,\" Rich said. \"And if somebody breaks into my house, which rifle would you suggest I tell my wife to grab?\"Which one should she grab? The one that gives her the best chance at protecting her and my kids or the one that doesn't?\" Rich asked fellow country music artists. \"Those are the types of questions I would like to ask them.\"You can find Sasha Savitsky on Twitter @SashaFB.On Our RadarEmRata STUNS in bikiniTMZStar's REVENGE bodyTMZPICS: Lori Loughlin's new $9M mansionTMZWhy 'The Rock' is endorsing THIS candidateTMZModel SIZZLES at lingerie showTMZMeghan's BIG Hollywood dealTMZLindsey Vonn in ACTIONTMZOn Our RadarEmRata STUNS in bikiniTMZStar's REVENGE bodyTMZPICS: Lori Loughlin's new $9M mansionTMZWhy 'The Rock' is endorsing THIS candidateTMZModel SIZZLES at lingerie showTMZMeghan's BIG Hollywood dealTMZLindsey Vonn in ACTIONTMZCelebrity News1 hour ago'Seinfeld' actor Jerry Stiller's $5M estate divvied among family, aides, charitiesDivorce2 hours agoTim Robbins files for divorce from wife Gratiela Brancusi after marrying in secret: reportsDwayne 'The Rock' Johnson3 hours agoDwayne 'The Rock' Johnson recalls 'incredibly complicated' relationship with father Rocky JohnsonOscars5 hours agoJared Leto reveals Oscar went missing three years ago: 'It somehow just magically kind of disappeared'Departed5 hours agoLarry King's wife Shawn King speaks out after TV talk-show icon is laid to rest: 'I'm still processing'Celebrity News5 hours agoCandace Cameron Bure defends response over family photo against online criticsCoronavirusU.S.CrimeMilitaryEducationTerrorImmigrationEconomyPersonal FreedomsFox News InvestigatesWorldU.N.ConflictsTerrorismDisastersGlobal EconomyEnvironmentReligionScandalsOpinionPoliticsExecutiveSenateHouseJudiciaryForeign PolicyPollsElectionsEntertainmentCelebrity NewsMoviesTV NewsMusic NewsStyle NewsEntertainment VideoBusinessPersonal FinanceEconomyMarketsWatchlistLifestyleReal EstateTechLifestyleFood + DrinkCars + TrucksTravel + OutdoorsHouse + HomeFitness + Well-beingStyle + BeautyFamilyFaithScienceArchaeologyAir & SpacePlanet EarthWild NatureNatural ScienceDinosaursTechSecurityInnovationDronesComputersVideo GamesMilitary TechHealthCoronavirusHealthy LivingMedical ResearchMental HealthCancerHeart HealthChildren's HealthTVShowsPersonalitiesWatch LiveFull EpisodesShow ClipsNews ClipsAboutContact UsCareersFox Around the WorldAdvertise With UsMedia RelationsCorporate InformationComplianceSupplier DiversityOtherFox NationFox News ShopFox News GoFox News RadioNewslettersAlertsPodcastsApps & ProductsFacebookTwitterFlipboardGoogle+InstagramRSSEmailFox NewsNew Terms of UseUpdated Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell my Personal InformationClosed Captioning PolicyHelpContact UsAccessibility StatementThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2021 FOX News Network, LLC.
