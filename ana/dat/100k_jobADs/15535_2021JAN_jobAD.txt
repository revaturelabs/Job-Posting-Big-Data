"New Jobless Claims Rose Last Week | The Capital SpectatorThe Capital SpectatorInvesting, Asset Allocation, Economics & the Search for the Bottom LineMenuSkip to contentHomeAboutAnalyticsBooksErrata & AddendaCodeConsultingContactNewslettersPrivacyNew Jobless Claims Rose Last WeekJobless claims increased last week, dashing hopes that we’d see a new five-year low in the weekly number in today’s report. New filings for unemployment benefits in the US rose 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 357,000—the highest since mid-February. Is this a sign that the labor market is poised for a slowdown? Yes, if new claims continue to trend higher. For now, it’s best to reserve judgment and assume that the recent improvement in this leading indicator–i.e., falling levels–is intact. We’re still a long way from an ominous signal on this front and history suggests that it’s short-sighted to think otherwise until the data tell us there’s trouble ahead in a clear and unambiguous way.Meantime, it’s still not obvious that the recent downtrend has ended. As the falling four-week average (red line) reminds, new claims have recently dropped to the levels at or near five-year lows. Although the four-week average ticked up last week, moving every so slightly above the five-year low set in the previous report, it’s hard to conclude anything definitive from one week’s change.Reviewing claims data in unadjusted terms on a year-over-year basis shows that the falling trend has slowed but remains in a range that’s been typical in recent history.Even if claims turn higher in the weeks ahead, most of the March numbers are in at this point and it’s likely that the month’s full read will compare favorably with February. Yes, April may be rocky, but jobless claims for this month have fallen, which implies that next week’s March update on payrolls from ADP and the Labor Department will report more of the same: modest growth.By James Picerno | Mar 28, 2013 at 09:35 am EDTPost navigation← Asset Allocation & Rebalancing Review | 28 March 2013 ISM Manufacturing Index: March 2013 Preview →Coronavirus MonitoringCDCCoronavirus news/infoCoronavirus Panic IndexCovid Tracking ProjectCorona TrackerEconomic Effects of CoronavirusFT Coronavirus MonitorIMHE Covid-19 ProjectionsJohns Hopkins1PointThreeAcresOur World In Data”Rt.liveUS Health Weather MapWHOWorldometerEnter your email to subscribe:Powered by FeedBlitzJanuary 2021MTWTFSS1 2 34 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15 16 1718 19 20 21 22 23 2425 26 27 28 29 30 31« DecSearch CapitalSpectator.comUS Equities (SPY):SPY Chart by TradingViewUS Bonds (BND):BND Chart by TradingViewFederal Gov’tBureau of Eco AnalysisBureau of Labor StatsCensus BureauCongressional Budget OfficeEnergy Info AdminFederal ReserveLabor Dept NewsroomOMBSECUS TreasuryWH Council of Eco AdvisersInt’l Financial OrgsBank for Int’l SettlementsInt’l Monetary FundOrg for Eco Co-Op & DevWorld BankNews AggregatorsAbnormal ReturnsMacroDigestNews NowReal Clear MarketsSeeking AlphaStreet SleuthTalk MarketsWealth 365Financial MediaBloombergCNBCThe EconomistFinancial TimesMarketwatch.comReutersThe Wall St JournalFinance/Econ BlogsAcademic InsightsAdvisor PerspectivesBasis PointsBig PictureDaily ShotChristophe BarraudDash of InsightEconobrowserEconofactEconomist’s ViewHaverHoran Capital AdvisorsMoney IllusionMPI Research CornerPension PartnersUPFINAYardeniPodcastsBloomberg BenchmarkThe Curious Investor (AQR)The Economist RadioEconTalkThe Investors PodcastMacro MusingsMarketplaceMasters In BusinessWSJ Your Money BriefingMarketsBarchart.comInvesting.comYahoo FinanceDataBR Geopolitical Risk DashboardEconoMagicEco Policy UncertaintyEconStatsEurostatFREDMSCIMorningstarOECD StatsOur World In DataPartisan Conflict IndexQuandlFrank Russell CoShillerS&P Sector ETFsS&P Dow Jones IndicesStandard & Poor’sStock ChartsTrading EconomicsWhale WisdomWilshireUS gov’t dataToolsBacktesterETF.com Fund ScreenerETFreplayFinVizInvestorCraftMorningstar ToolsPortfolio VisualizerReuters Fund ScreenerStyle ScanTarget Date SolutionsV-LabQuantsASM Quant MacroRob CarverCSSAData Driven InvestorEconomic Tracker (Harvard U.)Eran RavivGestaltUHyndsightOSMPeter’s Stats StuffQuantitative Analysis & TradingQuant InsightQuantocracyQuant Strat TradeRQuintuitiveR BloggersSimply StatsTowards Data ScienceTwo SigmaCalendars of Economic ReleasesBriefing.comEconoDayMarketWatchProudly powered by WordPressWe use cookies on this website.
