Outcomes included reduction in unplanned hospital admissions, decreased Emergency Department presentations from 10 to 0 and improved quality of life for patients and their families.The project drew praise from the audience including comments that it was ‘excellent work in contributing to ‘Closing the Gap’ and access to services for Aboriginal people’.Aboriginal Health Worker Michael Spencer said: ‘I think the Symposium was very informative also for the Elders that have acknowledged me about the BCCAP program’.The Symposium was hosted by the Tasmanian School of Medicine, Clinical Redesign team and the NSW Agency for Clinical Innovation Centre for Health Care Redesign.Georgina Drewery (Nurse Manager Integrated Care for People with Chronic Conditions and Leading Better Value Care) said the Symposium showcased many example of workplace innovation.“These are workplace innovation which have often been implemented at little or no extra cost and which have greatly improved patient outcomes through collaborative models and partnerships. The BCCAP program was one of those great example,” she said.She added that networking and making new connections to share innovation was available before, during and after the symposium.Media ReleaseComments are closed.Latest Media ReleasesTune In art exhibition winner announcedJanuary 20, 2021The Far West LHD is pleased to announce Jim Slater has b ...COVID-19 exposure venues in Far WestJanuary 5, 2021​There are currently no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in t ...Far West LHD BH Lead Health Program 2019 Annual Report releasedDecember 23, 2020There was a slight increase in lead levels for both Abor ...Far West Local Health District Board 2020 Annual Public MeetingDecember 17, 2020The Annual Public Meeting of the Far West Local Health D ...Far West LHD COVID-19 testing and screening clinics during holiday periodDecember 17, 2020Testing and screening for COVID-19 will be maintained du ...Eight tips to look after each other over the festive seasonDecember 10, 2020The festive season can often trigger feelings of lonelin ...Fundraising Group of Breast Cancer Support Group donation to Oncology UnitDecember 8, 2020The Broken Hill Breast Cancer Support Fundraising Group ...Generous donation of Christmas gifts for Oncology Unit patientsDecember 8, 2020The Broken Hill Oncology Unit has once again received a ...Far West LHD Health Innovation and Staff Excellence Awards winners for 2020November 24, 2020The Far West LHD Health Innovations and Staff Excellence ...Major upgrade for BreastScreen services to improve patient experienceNovember 5, 2020A new BreastScreen area has been built at the Broken Hil ...Latest NewsTune In art exhibition winner announcedJanuary 20, 2021The Far West LHD is pleased to announce Jim Slater has b ...COVID-19 exposure venues in Far WestJanuary 5, 2021​There are currently no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in t ...TestimonialsThe Health Service have been really supportive.
