Then I would still have this consolation - my joy in unrelenting pain - that I had not denied the words of the Holy One. - Job 6:8-10This is a heart breaking prayer. Job is so miserable that he just wants to die. His prayer is that God would finish the job and just crush him. I have never been the victim of chronic pain, but I have known those who were and that kind of constant, unrelenting pain causes a person to seek death rather than to go on suffering.However, Job wasn't just wanting to end his suffering. He wanted to end his life before he became unable to resist being bitter toward God and denying him. At the heart of his prayer was his devotion to God and his Word.When our devotion is to God and not to ourselves then God can reveal himself.Prayer: Lord, help me to not give in to any temptation, especially the temptation to accuse you or to deny the truth of your word. In Jesus name I pray.
