The primary work would be making a custom photo gallery that would be used for all pages except the Home page, which would be a simple B&W/Helvetica with a menu and a couple submenus. Each menu item would be the photo gallery which I would like to pop-up to a full screen overlay and have a 2-up tile (2 images on each tile) with scrolling arrows function. My budget is small, about $500. Anyone interested I would want to see any photo galleries youâ€™ve built. Thanks!November 17, 2018 at 1:25 am #3430Scott_CisParticipantHi,I can surely help you being in your budget.Please get in touch: [email protected]Best regards,ScottSkype: cis.scottNovember 17, 2018 at 2:43 am #3431jk101SpectatorHelloCheck PM sent you detailsSkype james.kevinnAuthorPostsViewing 3 posts - 1 through 3 (of 3 total)You must be logged in to reply to this topic.Log InUsername:Password:Keep me signed inLog InWordPress NYC Community is proudly powered by WordPress and BuddyPress"
