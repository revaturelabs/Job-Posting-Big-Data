To the end, she/he will engage across to board to improve economic analysis, develop relations with National and International Finance Institutions (N/IFI) and contribute to programme and project formulation. She/he will support the work with all UNCT members on their positioning towards the national SDG investment debate and policy work, culminating in the third quarter of 2018 into an UN led SDG and Investment Forum.The UN and the Government of Egypt (GoE) have signed the UN Partnership Development Framework (UNPDF), which covers the period from 2018 till 2022. The it aims to address national development priorities through four outcomes; inclusive economic development; social justice; environmental sustainability and natural resource management and women’s empowerment. It sets the parameters of the work of the UN in Egypt for the next five years.The SDGs in Egypt have played a pivotal role in shaping the national Sustainable Development Strategy: Egypt Vision 2030 (SDS). In this spirit, the UNPDF aligns to both the SDS and SDGs. Egypt has made a commitment to achieving the SDGs, especially due to their contribution in the High Level Political Forum (HLPF) by presenting their Voluntary National Review (VNR) in 2016 and will do so again in 2018.From this commitment to achieving the SDGs, the primary challenge is to ensure that investment in the SDGs is a priority for all sectors of society (private sector, international community and national counterparts). Through establishing an enabling SDG Investment pathway, expanding strategic UN pilot projects and focusing on those who are furthest left behind, the UN system will be able to facilitate a powerful response to national development priorities.In aligning to the SDS, the UN will need to develop an additional focus on new sets of emerging issues. Foremost amongst these are the need for the country to reap a demographic dividend, balancing social progress and cohesion with the need to generate decent work of a young population. Other emerging topics are adaptation and mitigation of climate change and managing ecological vulnerabilities, the imperative to create livable and productive urban environments and the need to engage with the broader migration challenges that have brought between 2.5 and 5 Mln people to Egypt either as economic migrants or refugees. Moreover, while concerted efforts are made to evolving the national data ecology towards the expanded set of 169 indicators contained in SDGs, it is clear that new data will start to drive new dialogues. It is this expected that the UNCT’s combined analytical and policy advisory capacities will be challenged and will require additional support.In this context, the Development Economist, will become a major engine behind ensuring a coherent and well-coordinated police advice and dialogue agenda that contributes to the evolving debate on SDGs and Investment. The Development Economist will further provide key strategic advice on economic development issues and trends, and will take the lead in developing a clear vision of multi-dimensional poverty trends.Finally, the Development Economist will provide leadership to the Development Effectiveness debate within the UN system, as well as with the established Development Partners Group (DPG), which is co-chaired by the UNRC.Duties and ResponsibilitiesDeveloping new partnerships and financing opportunities for SDG implementation:- Identify and support building partnerships with relevant
