He has been employed by the Muncie Sanitary District since 1998.Marshall contacted the Star Press about the audit and provided a copy of a letter he received from the state board explaining the case. The SBOA letter references a law passed in 2013 that bars government employees from holding elected office.“I was shocked,” Marshall said of receiving the letter in February.'It's a miracle in my lifetime': Community helps rebuild veteran's home Yorktown man killed in Cornbread Road motorcycle crash Delaware County 911 dispatch center reports its own COVID-19 case Cowan boys basketball coach Lee Ingles dies at 50According to the letter, the SBOA has not considered him an employee of the Muncie Sanitary District since he started his second term as city council in January 2016. That means he could potentially face repaying the district his salary, nearly $193,407 since his re-election.Indiana Code 3-5-9-5 states that an individual is considered to have resigned as a government employee when the individual assumes an elected office of the unit that employs the individual.MUNCIE CITY COUNCIL:►Council member, city at odds over information►City council member Nora Powell receives records requested from cityThe Star Press contacted the state board of accounts for more information. Matt Light is chief of staff at the state board of accounts.\"We are unable to provide any comment until an examination report is filed and publicly available,\" Light said in response to an email. \"Statute prohibits us from publicly speaking to the results of an examination until that official filing occurs.\"Lawyers for the sanitary district also said they could not comment.“I don’t want to look like I’m trying to hide anything,” Marshall said of why he contacted the Star Press before the public release of the SBOA's examination.Marshall wasn't initially in violation of the law in 2013, a year into his first term, because it allowed politicians that were in violation to finish their terms. So the law would not apply to him until he won his re-election bid in fall 2015.It's not clear why Marshall was not notified of the violation before now, as the SBOA conducted an audit of the district's finances in 2017. Marshall said he was told the examination was started due to a complaint, something he believes happened because of the upcoming election.He is on the ballot for re-election in 2019, with his term ending on Dec. 31 of this year.This isn’t the first time that an elected Indiana official faced the double dipping law, giving precedent to Marshall’s case.According to a report by the Northwest Indiana Times, Gary City Councilwoman Mary M. Brown faced a similar issue with her job as a Gary sanitary district employee.Brown quit her job at the Gary Sanitary District in the middle of 2018 to continue holding her political office but was ordered to reimburse the district $132,742 in wages.►Muncie Mayor Dennis Tyler discusses Nichols, legacy during final year in officeMarshall says he would leave the sanitary district and find employment elsewhere to keep his council seat, similar to Brown.But he is not accepting the SBOA's allegations, however, as he disagrees with the SBOA stating that the sanitary district is an executive department of the city. It's why he didn't step down from the position when the law took effect, as previous information Marshall was issued told him he was in the clear.According to the letter, the SBOA considers the Muncie Sanitary District part of the municipality because of the ordinance that established it in 1968 as an executive department of the municipality, something Marshall says he doesn't think is correct.“I’ve always believed that the sanitary district is not an executive unit of Muncie,” Marshall said. According to him, the sanitary board does all its approvals for hiring, whereas the only business the council does involving the department is approving the a finance request that he frequently abstains from.“We don’t appoint anybody and we don’t recommend anybody. We only give their budgeting the OK,” Marshall said.The case against councilwomen Brown faced a similar discussion.Gary City Council Attorney Rinzer Williams III stated in a letter during Brown’s lawsuit to keep her job, that her two jobs didn't violate the law because the city of Gary and the Gary Sanitary District are two separate government units.Brown's case was pursued by Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill, who took a strong opinion against Brown in the case.“No citizen is above the law, even if that citizen happens to be a public office holder,” Attorney General Hill said in a press release at the start of the year in regard to Brown's case. “You can disagree with a law. You can lobby to change it. But you cannot ignore or disobey it.”Four elected officials, excluding Brown, in Northwest Indiana challenged the law as unconstitutional but lost the case in court. All four resigned their positions.Marshall hasn’t sought a lawyer to challenge the case yet, as he wanted to see the full report from the SBOA.About Us Staff Directory Corrections Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2021 www.thestarpress.com.
