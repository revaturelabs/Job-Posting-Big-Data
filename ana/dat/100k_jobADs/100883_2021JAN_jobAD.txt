Earlier this month I said to myself, (and Didi) for that matter, how much I‚Äôd love to get back into magazine writing. I miss it,I used to contribute a few articles to a book, beauty and fashion section a while back. I also wrote about this kinda dream you could say, in my own journal this month.Over the last twenty four hours the opportunity found me! The founder of the magazine was looking for an editor to take over, he connected with me on Facebook. What a surprise to land not only paid writing work outside of blogging and novel writing ,but to be asked to be the actual chief editor. Madness‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt believe it myself, anyway, I signed a contact and I‚Äôm about to launch this baby with a team of warriors and talented writers! See the flyer below if you are interested get in contact.The only thing I ask is be yourself, but be damn good when writing work to submit for publication. I‚Äôve renamed the magazine, and I plan on moving it in a new direction for a new bigger, more diverse readership.Details: Conscious Talk Magazine will launch its first online edition in August 2017. Conscious Talk Magazine is a proud online multi-cultural and diverse global magazine, covering a range of topics. There is something for everyone. Readers will find interesting thought provoking articles, from health and well being , fashion and beauty, bookish news and reviews, sex and relationships, men‚Äôs issues, finance, travel, music, LGBT, film and entertainment to name just a few. We‚Äôll have a team of talented and diverse writers from all corners of the globe, and walks of life, here to entertain, support and empower our reader‚Äôs mind, body and soul. Conscious Talk Magazine is neutral and does not lean to one side politically, religiously or socially. Conscious Talk Magazine is published twice a month on the 15th and 30th of each month.Readership Target: 25-50 years old, male and female, globally situated. Conscious intelligent readers not after Hollywood gossip!And there you have it‚Ä¶ my vision as editor. If it sounds like your thing as a writer to get involved with see below.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...This entry was posted in Magazine Articles, Uncategorized and tagged bloggers, magazine publication, newrelease, write for money, writerslife.

Submit your work for consideration. Hard to say without seeing the writing if you see what I mean. The categories that the magazine will have articles in are also shown, all works submitted should fit within the categories too. I hope this is helpful.LikeLiked by 1 personReply	inspirationpie says:	on August 14, 2017 at 3:11 am	Congratulations, Kim! That‚Äôs wonderful!
