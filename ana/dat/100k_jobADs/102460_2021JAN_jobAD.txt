Moses is self-aware. He’s aware that he’s a hypocrite who killed two men (Exodus 2:11-15 NIV). Moses is thinking, “No one in their right mind would follow me.” But yet, the moment in time we find him in is when God asks him to lead His people out of Israel where they are slaves. Moses is protesting. He’s coming up with reasons why God should get someone else to do the job. On top of his list of imperfections, he’s had some type of speech impediment which made talking difficult (Exodus 4:10 NIV). If I was Moses, I wouldn’t feel equipped for the job either. But God has a response for each of his protests. Finally, Moses cannot protest any more. Someone has to do the job, it might as well be you.Someone has to do the job, it might as well be you.I’m starting a new semester this week for my masters. I’m taking three classes which means 6 major projects and a ton of work in between. I do not feel equipped to do any of this. Yet I feel confident God is calling me to the task. I’ve been protesting for days. Asking Him if I can really do this? Should I drop a class? I’m afraid of failing, and I may fail. Only time will tell, I’ll never know if I don’t try. Someone has to take the class, it might as well be me.I don’t have statistical data on this, but I think everyone feels they aren’t equipped in some way. Mom’s don’t feel equipped to be a good Mom, Dad’s don’t feel equipped to be Dad’s. Teachers don’t feel equipped to teach, doctors don’t feel equipped to heal. Writers don’t feel equipped to write. But they do it anyway. They take the first step, then the next one, and the next one. Eventually they look back and realize, “I’m actually doing it. I’m doing what I thought I couldn’t do.” Don’t focus on what you can’t do, focus on what you can do and start there. One day at a time, until eventually you’ll realize you’re doing what you didn’t think you could do.Question of the Day:What is one thing you can do today in the job you don’t feel equipped to do?Further Reading: Exodus 4:1-5:21 NIV, Matthew 18:1-20 NIV, Psalm 22:19-31 NIV, Proverbs 5:15-21 NIVPublished by Beth MorrisonView all posts by Beth Morrison	Post navigationPrevious postONE WAY GOD COMMUNICATES TO YOUNext postWHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE FOCUS ON WHAT WE DON’T HAVELeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
