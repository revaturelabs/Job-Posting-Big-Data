She says London is home to theatres, concert venues, hidden- gem restaurants, and great education and health organizations.“With Toronto two hours east and Detroit two hours west, London’s central location is an ideal base for anyone who wants to venture to larger metropolitan areas without paying big-city cost of living.”Voices.com founders Dave and Stephanie Ciccarelli are Londoners who founded their company in a downtown recording studio in 2004.In 2017, the company got an $18-million US investment from Morgan Stanley – believed to be the largest single investment in a London technology company – and the next year, bought a competitor from California and merged operations.Recruiting employees has been easy, says Beausaert.“The cost of living is very reasonable for younger people. It’s manageable for new grads or people who are mid-career and looking for a bigger house, bigger property, a smaller city or a different lifestyle.”As well, the company designed and built a 45,000-square-foot open-concept office space in downtown London.“For me, I had the option to go to Toronto or London. London feels like a city I can put my stamp on,” said Beausaert. “The lifestyle here is something can’t achieve in a larger city.You can have an amazing career and have a life after work.Your money goes so much further here.You can save here and still have a great life.”Info-TechIT research and advisory company Info- Tech has been growing so fast, it physically couldn’t contain the new employees it needed.
