Mr. Carmichael was in Brussels yesterday for high level meetings with the UK nominated Commissioner, the UK Permanent Representative to the EU and the EU and the new Fisheries Committee Chair.Commenting, Mr. Carmichael said:“I am delighted that the next chair of the EU Fisheries Committee is to be a Liberal Democrat. I have known Chris Davies for many years. He is hard-working and committed. Yesterday in Brussels we were able to discuss how he, as a Committee Chair, could improve the representation of our fishing communities in Brussels.“With International Council for the Exploration of the Sea advice believed to be showing a steep decline in North Sea Cod the December Fisheries Council this year could be a difficult one. Of course, if we have left the EU on 31st October that will be made worse by the fact that we will not have UK representation in the room.”He continued:“I also made this point to the UK Permanent Representative to the EU when I met him yesterday that Brexit risks being all-consuming so he must not take his eye off the ball on this most important part of his day job. I have never seen a UK official look so pleased to talk about a December Fisheries Council!”Find out more about our work - sign up for emails today:Optional email codeFirst NameLast NameEmailPostcodeCan we keep you updated?Yes, I'd like to get emails from the local Liberal Democrats.The Liberal Democrats will use your contact details to send you information on the topics you have requested.
