Any information would be helpful. Their starting pay seemed pretty low (18pln) Also what is the starting wage in Poland? How much is needed to live (pay rent+) and do some socializing maybe even save a little?Thanks for the help.Back to topspiral78Joined: 05 Apr 2004Posts: 11534Location: On a Short LeashPosted: Tue Mar 04, 2014 4:19 pm Post subject:Pretty much all Berlitz locations (like the other 'method' schools) pay at the low(est) end of the local scale wherever they are. This is ostensibly for two reasons: little to no prep required and they hire teachers without certification, because they are going to train you in their (antique) method anyway.They can be reasonable as an 'in' somewhere, but experience at a Berlitz or other method school won't be especially attractive to other employers, who by definition don't employ the same method/s.Back to topsparksJoined: 20 Feb 2008Posts: 632Posted: Tue Mar 04, 2014 8:11 pm Post subject:I interviewed with them in Warsaw once, just to see...The offer was something like 28 PLN for 45 min. BEFORE tax. 45 PLN for 45 minutes if you have your own company.I try not to complain about the wages in Poland, and we really do live quite alright.Honestly what they offer is NOT a living wage. It is a horrible joke. I can't imagine why anyone works for them. I really wish everyone would boycott that place. It's pathetic.Back to topspiral78Joined: 05 Apr 2004Posts: 11534Location: On a Short LeashPosted: Tue Mar 04, 2014 8:49 pm Post subject:And now they are apparently offering just 18?Back to topBocaNYJoined: 24 Mar 2009Posts: 131Posted: Tue Mar 04, 2014 10:26 pm Post subject:28pln was the max you could make per 40min class in your second year. 18pln to start then to 21pln after 3months then to 23 after six months finally 28 after the 1 year.It sounded low to me. I worked at a language school and it paid more then actually schools expect university. This blows I want/need a job and now doesn't seem to be the time to find work unless it's a language school.Any ideas what countries to look ...not china, japan, or korea.Back to topspiral78Joined: 05 Apr 2004Posts: 11534Location: On a Short LeashPosted: Tue Mar 04, 2014 10:57 pm Post subject:Wrong time of year for this continent where most contracts are Sept/oct thru June and there is little summer work.Back to topdelphian-domineJoined: 11 Mar 2011Posts: 674Posted: Wed Mar 05, 2014 8:19 am Post subject:Boca, are you interested in working with kids?I'm in the process of starting the recruitment process for a new teacher - I don't have the job description prepared yet, but we'll offer accommodation/work permit/usual stuff.Back to topdragonpiwoJoined: 04 Mar 2013Posts: 1650Location: BerlinPosted: Wed Mar 05, 2014 9:13 am Post subject: haYet another horror story.Back to topsparksJoined: 20 Feb 2008Posts: 632Posted: Wed Mar 05, 2014 10:31 am Post subject:I must have blocked out the 18 zl figure. It makes me angry to think that this place is still in business, is a global business in fact. They have posters and things on walls there with a list of all of the famous people who have worked there over the years, James Joyce and other famous writers. I wish that one of them would have mentioned what rats they areI could also get you an interview here in Warsaw if you PM me. They will also get you a work visa and residency card if you need one.Back to topdragonpiwoJoined: 04 Mar 2013Posts: 1650Location: BerlinPosted: Wed Mar 05, 2014 5:56 pm Post subject: haThe thing is 18Zl/hour seems infinitely preferable to where I am right nowBack to topBocaNYJoined: 24 Mar 2009Posts: 131Posted: Thu Mar 06, 2014 2:27 am Post subject:Thanks delphian-domine and sparks for offering to help. I pm-ed you both.I figured it was the wrong time of year but I was hoping to maybe pick up a vacancy left by a non returning teacher somewhere or a summer camp. If i wasn't so bored not working i would just hold out til the end of summer. :pBack to topdelphian-domineJoined: 11 Mar 2011Posts: 674Posted: Thu Mar 06, 2014 7:15 am Post subject:sparks wrote:I must have blocked out the 18 zl figure.

Wages might be pathetic, but bear in mind that it's a 'method' school that is willing to employ almost anyone. I also suspect that they don't value native speakers at all, which is why the offer seems low - it's clearly aimed at nNEST graduates.And they also have to pay for those lovely schools in lovely locations...Back to topMaster ShakeJoined: 03 Nov 2006Posts: 1202Location: Colorado, USAPosted: Thu Mar 06, 2014 11:57 am Post subject:The range of wages tefl teachers get always amazes me: from 18zl/hr to well over 100zl/hr - all in the same country for what essentially is the same service.I've always considered 60zl/hour net to be the gold standard in Warsaw for a qualified native speaker. Anything less, and you're selling yourself short.Back to topBocaNYJoined: 24 Mar 2009Posts: 131Posted: Thu Mar 06, 2014 12:01 pm Post subject:It is amazing but I guess the lower end jobs target new comers and ones without some sort of cert. Sucks because if I get desperate enough I might actually consider it. I am almost done with my masters in TESOL but the last 3 classes I have to take require me to be teaching. If I can get work soon then I'll be done with it by summer.Back to topdexterityJoined: 16 Nov 2013Posts: 9Posted: Fri Mar 07, 2014 12:35 pm Post subject:Go to Speed School in Wroclaw if you have the ability to do so. The school is \"Native Speakers\" only (the only Polish staff are the admins), they are willing to train you (with lesson observations) and they have an immediate vacancy.Back to topDisplay posts from previous: All Posts1 Day7 Days2 Weeks1 Month3 Months6 Months1 Year Oldest FirstNewest FirstJob Discussion Forums Forum Index -> Poland All times are GMTGoto page 1, 2 NextPage 1 of 2Jump to: Select a forum Where to Begin----------------General DiscussionNewbie ForumCurrent Events ForumTechnology ForumOnline Teaching Forum Africa Forums----------------General Africa Forum Asia Forums----------------CambodiaChina (Job-related Posts Only)China (Off-Topic)Hong KongIndiaIndonesiaJapanMalaysiaPhilippinesSingaporeTaiwanThailandGeneral Asia ForumVietnam Caribbean Forums----------------General Caribbean Forum Europe Forums----------------Czech RepublicFranceGermanyGreeceItalyMacedonia and the BalkansPolandRomaniaRussia & C.I.S.SpainTurkeyUkraineUnited KingdomGeneral Europe Forum Latin America Forums----------------ArgentinaBrazilChileColombiaCosta RicaMexicoMexico (off-topic)PeruGeneral Latin America Forum The Middle East Forums----------------BahrainEgyptIsraelKuwaitOmanQatarSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesGeneral Middle East Forum North America Forums----------------General North America Forum Oceania----------------Australia/New ZealandYou cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forumThis page is maintained by the one and only Dave Sperling.Contact Dave's ESL CafeCopyright © 2018 Dave Sperling.
