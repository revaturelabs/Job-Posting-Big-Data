Previous project|Next project ?1 of 61 of 6Meixi Lake Exhibition CenterChangsha, ChinaThis new exhibition center is anticipated to become an international tourist destination for the growing city of Changsha. To realize this vision, the Gensler design incorporates visual aspects of the site’s surrounding topography, seamlessly assimilating it with the neighboring Meixi Lake. The dynamic interplay between nature’s fluid and solid forms are integrated with broader concepts of growth in the site’s design. Convention spaces will be housed in two elegant, wing-shaped structures, each with a sloping green roof connecting to the natural scenery, while reducing the building’s energy use. A clever combination of glass, zinc and wood cladding creates a highly recognizable, versatile and unique landmark alongside the Changsha River.ExpertiseArchitecture ?Related ContentGensler Research InstituteCurating the Right MixCan China create better cities?
