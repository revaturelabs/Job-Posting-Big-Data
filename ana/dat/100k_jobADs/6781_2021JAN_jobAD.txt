The drop was led by a decline in government job postings. Businesses actually posted slightly more jobs.Total hiring jumped 81,000 to 4.87 million, the highest level since December 2007, when the recession began. That indicates that companies are more likely to fill their open jobs.The report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey or JOLTS, provides a more detailed look at the job market than the monthly employment report.To sign up for free CityBusiness Daily Updates, click here.hiring job openings jobs JOLTs 9:15 am Tue, September 9, 2014 New Orleans CityBusiness	The Associated PresstweetTagged with: hiring job openings jobs JOLTsLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
