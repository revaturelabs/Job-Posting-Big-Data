Let's leave negative talk about Walter Isaacson's book out of it.This book is really good. I'm inspired by Steve Job's restlessness and insatiable quest for building insanely great products. His focus and passion just gives me a bit more energy to work harder to try to make a difference. It's the same inspiration I got from reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. The feeling that what really matters is quality. From the smallest minutia to the broadest strokes. It's all about quality.I felt like I had a good sense for Steve Job's life and work after Walter Isaacson's biography on him which covers all the major parts of his life (in some aspects more completely than this biography, if my memory serves me correctly), but Brent Schlender had a different, perhaps more intimate, vantage point from which to narrate the story of Steve Jobs. My favorite parts of this book were accounts of the little moments in Steve Job's life that could only be spoken about by people who knew him closely. First-hand accounts of interactions with John Lasseter, Jony Ives, Tim Cook, and Bill Gates made Steve Jobs come to life in a new way.Brent Schlender went out of his way to make the case that Steve transformed from the brash, punk, capricious founder of Apple into a strong, disciplined leader, who was a good friend and a good father and husband. It is a story of change and growth, the archetype we all love, and it makes him and his story that much more endearing.I often feel a bit sad at the end of a biography when the subject dies, as if I am losing a friend I have grown to care a lot about, but I felt especially reluctant to finish this book today. I don't want to be Steve Jobs, but I sure like his story. Would've been a thrill to know him.---Below are notes and quotes for my personal reference:Steve to John Lasseter: \"You know, when we make a computer at Apple what's it's lifespan About three years At five years it's a doorstop, but if you do your job right, what you create can last forever.\" An interesting perspective on tech vs content. Tech gets stale much faster, while great content can live for many, many years.\"I watched Bob Dylan as I was growing up and I watched him never stand still. If you look at true artists, if they get really good at something it occurs to them that they can do this for the rest of their lives and they can be really successful at it to the outside world, but not really successful to themselves. That's the moment that an artist decides who he/she is. If they keep on risking failure they're still artists. Dylan and Picasso were always risking failure... I finally decided I don't really care, this is what I want to do. And if I tried my best and fail, well I tried my best.\" - Steve Jobs\"The reason you sugarcoat things is that you don't want anyone to think you're an asshole. So that's vanity... If he really cared about the work, he would be less vain and talk directly about the work.\" - Jony Ives\"On almost every film they make something turns out to be not quite right, and they have an amazing willingness to turn around and do it again until they do get it right. They have always had an amazing willingness to not be governed by the release date.It's not about how fast you do something. It's about doing your level best.\" Steve Jobs talking about something he learned at Pixar.1 downloads 143 Views 2.4 MB SizeDOWNLOAD EPUBRelated DocumentsWalter Isaacson] Steve Jobs134 viewssecrets of Steve jobs1.278 viewsSteve Jobs American Genius689 viewsWho Was Steve Jobs by Pollack Pam, Belviso Meg459 viewsWho Was Steve Jobs by Pollack Pam Belviso Meg352 viewsLeading Apple With Steve Jobs- Management Lessons From a Controversial Genius343 viewsPresentation-Secrets-Of-Steve-Jobs428 viewsSteve, Lois Rabey, Steve Rabey - 101 Most Powerful Verses in the Bible (101 Most Powerful Series) (2004)214 viewsSteve Lucas - Tomatoes Tips Before You Begin By Steve (2012)3.094 viewsA Leader Must Be a Leader Encounters With Eleven Prime Ministers156 viewsin becoming a leader303 viewsmm becoming a leader2.955 viewsbecoming a strategic leader695 viewson becoming a leader1.031 viewsBecoming-a-Resonant-Leader-Develop-Your-Emotional-Intelligence-Renew-Your-Relationships-Sustain-Your-Effectiveness711 viewsbecoming a leader1.567 viewsBecoming a Strategic Leader Y599 viewsOn Becoming a Leader by Warren Bennis2.917 viewsGinger Scott - Wild Reckless303 viewsLarsen, Veronica - Reckless Touch622 viewsReckless Memories - Catherine Cowles111 viewsHeads in Beds A Reckless Memoir of Hotels, Hustles, and So-Called Hospitality2.051 viewsL J Shen -Pretty Reckless All Saints High133 viewsElla Miles - Sinful Truths 3 - Reckless Fall137 viewsBethany-Kris - The Chicago War 2 - Reckless & Ruined137 viewsthe everyday visionary793 viewsElectric-Eden-Unearthing-Britain-s-Visionary-Music621 viewsArthur Lismer, Visionary Art Educator238 viewsLinda Star Wolf & Anne Dillon - Visionary Shamanism7.671 viewsKant, Shelley and the Visionary Critique of Metaphysics1.108 viewsRecommend DocumentsBecoming Steve Jobs Amazing Lessons on How to Be Like Steve JobsMGI Report Jobs lost, jobs gained Workforce transitions in a time of automationSteve jobsThe-Steve-Jobs-way-iLeadership-for-a-new-generation-SummaryWalter Isaacson - Steve Jobs - 2011Who Was Steve JobsWalter Isaacson - Steve JobsSteve Jobs - Walter IsaacsonWalter Isaacson - Steve Jobs The Exclusive BiographySteve Jobs by Walter IsaacsonCopyright Â© 2021 MYBOOKOPOLIS.COM.
