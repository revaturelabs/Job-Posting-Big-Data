As we move ahead with technologies and tools built to leverage the Internet, scepticism is gaining ground on the potential impact of the Internet on taking away jobs.This Dynamic Coalition on ‘Internet & Jobs’ has come from the realization of the need for sustainable and responsible automation, and the potential of the Internet to create jobs and boost the local economies. It is a result of the initiatives taken by Prof. Rajendra Pratap Gupta at the IGF, since 2018 when it was held in Paris and then, in 2019, at Berlin.Our goals:To create jobs across sectors and geographies, through a multi-stakeholder, ecosystem approach of: Connect, Coordinate, Activate, Train, and Enable.To help people realise the human resource and entrepreneurial potential of the Internet across the globe.Action PlanWe will come out with an annual report on ‘Internet & Jobs’ capturing the opportunities, best practices, and success stories, to inspire people to leverage the Internet to build local economies and connect them to the global opportunities.Organize online and offline workshops on how local communities can leverage the Internet for a better lifeShowcase our real-life stories and brain-storm ideas and innovations at the local IGF and annual IGF meetingsMailing ListMailing List Address: [email protected]StakeholdersThe coalition is open to any organization, entity or individual working in the field, including Standard Developing Organizations (SDOs).Disease Management Association of India (an organisation with a special consultative status with the United Nations - ECOSOC).
