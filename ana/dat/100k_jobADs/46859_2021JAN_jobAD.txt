NBC.com is also listing the start time as 8:50pm.Additional footage at the end! Woo-hoo!Tipsters: Andrew, Jim MosbyCategoriesNews44 comments	Janet says:	September 20, 2007 at 6:46pmAhh, no wonder I missed Michael early for the interview and Big Haircut. They actually seem to be cutting quite a bit to have room for all the NBC promos of new shows. Good thing I have the DVD.Jesse says:	September 20, 2007 at 6:48pmI’d imagine they just wanted 10 more minutes of ad time.Awful too, all the commercials were brutal on the pacing of the episode.Spicyblues says:	September 20, 2007 at 6:52pmI just noticed tonight as I was watching ‘The Job’. You can see palm trees in the background of all of the car rides.I just thought that was funny. :)Katie says:	September 20, 2007 at 6:58pmIt’s ten minutes early, because they did the summer update at the end, with a new scene with Kelly and Toby at the end.brittany says:	September 20, 2007 at 6:58pmthey showed the “summer vacation” clip at the end. it also had a little kelly/toby footage i hadn’t seen before!flavor: blueblast says:	September 20, 2007 at 6:58pmNBC played the Office Summer Vacation with a new Toby TH and Kelly TH of her laying under her desk. SO funny._bales says:	September 20, 2007 at 6:58pmHey West Coasters! Stay tuned for the “Summer Vacation” promo at the end of “The Job”. The end is slightly different from the version on YouTube and it is hilarious!muppet babies tatoo says:	September 20, 2007 at 6:58pmThey just aired the Summer vacation promo after the show aired, and they changed Kelly’s TH, and added one of Toby. Its pretty hilarious.Afganistanany says:	September 20, 2007 at 6:58pmPlayed the Summer Vacation clips, but there were new ones of Toby and Kelly. I love Toby, for serious.zack says:	September 20, 2007 at 6:58pmHAHAHA! I loved the little add on with Kelly they did! Too bad that was the only new part.Nichomes says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:00pmI think they started early in order to show the “summer vacation” promos and they were a little different than the ones online.aronoel says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:00pmI just received my letter from Ryan Howard. Did you receive yours.E says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:01pmAt the end they aired the Summer Vacation video…with everyone…and Kelly’s was different. One more week!dwigt says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:03pmthey added extra footage at the end. thats why…Dominee says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:03pmFun to watch, as always! I was disappointed that there was no new footage, aside from Kelly crying under her desk and Toby’s joy of her being unable to speak. I guess they are keeping tight lipped about next week.Beatriz says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:03pmAnyone get the email from Ryan yet?Name says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:10pmJust got an e-mail from Ryan. It made my heart leap to see “Ryan Howard” in my inbox. I need to get out more.Office Fan says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:11pmFor serious Ryan, the paper industry is a dying business no matter how you slice it. Unless you invented some “office supply-fueled” car, you will never be bigger than Exxon.With that said, I am excited to join the DM team.E says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:12pmI got my email…hilarious.Dunder Mifflin Infinity is a unique opportunity. We are committed to excellence. Stay with us long enough and you’ll want to be committed, too.officeisms1978 says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:19pmAhh! They showed a new clip after the Job of another installment of what The Office did on their summer vacation, did anyone see it??Too funny. I love Toby’s little evil/completely happy smile. hahaSpencer says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:19pmwe need some new footage for next week! and the email from ryan was great, especially since it popped up just as the summer vacation clip was ending. just one more week!Voltaire says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:25pmCould anyone describe the new scenes? I didn’t watch, not knowing there would be new footage!milliegraydon says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:45pmoh no! i turned it off early cause i didn’t know there was any new footage! youtube maybe?Samuel L. Chang says:	September 20, 2007 at 7:53pmThe footage was the same promo we’ve seen about what everyone on The Office did on their summer vacation. There were a few changes, though. Kelly is shown crying under her desk and Toby grins when he says Kelly can’t even talk because she’s so upset about Ryan.BenA says:	September 20, 2007 at 8:23pmDoes anyone have a link to these scenes? They aren’t deleted scenes from the DVD are they?Creepy Spice says:	September 20, 2007 at 9:37pmIt’s emotionally magnificent.GeorgeJetson says:	September 20, 2007 at 10:01pmThat last bit with Kelly and Toby was just… I don’t know how to explain it. It was just brilliant.And there was a nifty little advertisement for the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website at the end.Now, time to wait for the premiere! (Which will kill me.)sara says:	September 21, 2007 at 3:01am*single tear* I missed it…Emily says:	September 21, 2007 at 5:38amOh my gosh!!!! I want to see the new clip…. I was studying for a test.Andrew says:	September 21, 2007 at 5:48amFirst time tipster! Woohoo!I couldn’t bring myself to watch it with the commercials, and since I figured the new footage was on the DVD’s, I just watched those.Is the Kelly-Toby scene online?Pam's BFF says:	September 21, 2007 at 6:20amCorrect me if I’m wrong, but I thought there was a new Pam TH when Dwight wanted everyone in the conference room for his lecture “in 10 seconds!” — and then it went to a Pam TH where she said she was really excited to see what Dwight had in store for them and then how much she wished Jim was there. Was this in the deleted scenes or was this brand new footage? I don’t remember that being in the original. Anyone else?rosiethereceptionist says:	September 21, 2007 at 6:28amToby’s face – PricelessHeather says:	September 21, 2007 at 6:31amI also loved Toby’s smile when he was talking about Kelly. We’ve seen so few of his smiles!“30% more unpredictable.”Voltaire says:	September 21, 2007 at 6:45amPam’s BFF – I’m pretty sure that scene was in the original episode.Cayce80 says:	September 21, 2007 at 6:57amI missed the episode last night, too. Darn it. I wish I had visited Office Tally again just before I left from work. (Sigh). Maybe someone will post the new scenes later?_bales says:	September 21, 2007 at 8:40amhi, courtesy of the good folks over at Office Livejournal, the Summer Vacation promo with the new clips can be found hereClaire says:	September 21, 2007 at 11:45amthanks for posting it!leslie says:	September 21, 2007 at 12:30pmdid any one see the additional scene? is it not on the DVD, either? hoping someone will post it….KarenTheKimSlayer says:	September 21, 2007 at 12:56pmwhat new scenes were aired last night?phyllis*farm says:	September 21, 2007 at 2:00pmAs far as I know there was nothing added last night; it just started early to make time for more commercials (ugh) and the summer vacation promo.ER says:	September 21, 2007 at 2:25pmSort of off topic, has The Office officially moved to 9pm? Thanks.Roni says:	September 21, 2007 at 4:34pmAww… I like snarky!Kelly better. But the Toby TH was priceless!!Number12 says:	September 21, 2007 at 7:03pmSo I missed tonight’s episode? What this about a Kelly/Toby scene. I don’t remember that on the DVD deleted scenes? So was this a new one? Or we talking about the summer vacation thing? Will that be online??Andrew says:	September 21, 2007 at 10:30pmThe extra scene was not in the episode but rather in the 2 minute “What the Office did during the Summer” promo. Instead of Kelly saying Ryan was a virgin, she refuses to talk because of the break-up and Toby can barely contain the smile he gets from her silent misery.Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.CommentNameEmailWebsitePost navigationPrevious PostPrevious NBC diversity promo contestNext PostNext Ryan says, ‘Your life is about to change’Search for:SearchWelcome to OfficeTally, the top fansite for NBC's hit comedy, 'The Office.'Latest postsOfficeTally’s impact on The Office: the Mashable interview“An Oral History of The Office” podcastThe Office cast reunites for a quarantine weddingHeroesPractice social distancingPopular postsAndy sings 'Rainbow Connection' to PamVIDEO: The Office FarewellsVIDEO: The Office 2003 auditionsWarning: The Office can cause detentionIt is your wedding cake.CategoriesEpisode Q&AFinaleHalloweenPhotosQuotesRingtonesSet visitsVideoWallpaperAll categoriesOfficeTally on TwitterOfficeTally on FacebookCopyright © 2021 OfficeTally.
