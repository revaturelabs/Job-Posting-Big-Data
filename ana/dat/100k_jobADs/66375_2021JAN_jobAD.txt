Moreover, that of distributing the remaining wines and spirits also had to be terminated as volumes had now dropped below commercially viable levels. Wrap up activities will be concluded in March 2009, he said.Inevitably this increased the need to rationalise staff, Letsholo added.“However, KBL and BBL have undertaken to minimise these job losses and the associated impact. To this end, all affected employees have been encouraged to apply for vacancies that may exist in the businesses for due consideration. Notwithstanding, all due diligence and established company recruitment and selection policies and procedures will not be compromised,” he emphasised.He said in the meantime necessary consultations with the employee unions and the Commissioner of Labour and Social Security are on-going, with the affected employees undergoing counselling sessions.When the levy was implemented, KBL and BBL announced that they would not hasten to adjust the business per projections at the time. Instead, the companies would first observe the reality of the envisaged negative consequences.But last month KBL indicated that the way the 30% alcohol levy was being implemented disadvantaged the local producers and gave an unfair competitive edge to importers.This because for local producers, the levy is charged on ex-factory selling price while for importers it is charged on Cost Insurance & Freight on Import. As a result, for companies such as KBL, the levy is imposed even on margins while for competitor imports it is only limited to the importer.Thus the resultant quantum of the levy is significantly lower in the case of imported products, said Letsholo at the time.FacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinTelegramRELATED STORIESLetsholo to leave KBL in MarchKhama urges the nation to work hard to reposition the countryKBL appoints first Batswana to directorship positionsMORE BY THIS AUTHORNewspaperSunday Standard October 18 – 24Online editor - 17th October 2020Digital copy of Sunday Standard issue of October 18 - 24, 2020.Read moreGov’t out-sourcing was not a response to 2011 strike-MakgalemeleOnline editor - 20th July 2015The introduction of out-sourcing of some operations in key government Ministries was not a response to the 2011 public sector strike, but a result...Read moreBusinessFrench Ambassador preaches sustainable poverty eradicationOnline editor - 20th July 2015French Ambassador to Botswana, Anne de la Bpache says Botswana should adopt a sustainable strategy of combating and eliminating poverty.
