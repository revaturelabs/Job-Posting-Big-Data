The bill essentially will increases the per-country cap on family-based immigrant visas from the current 7 per cent of the total number of such visas available in a particular year to 15 per cent.At present, the US issues 140,000 of these green cards annually.There are over 800,000 Indians in line for an employment-based green card as of April 2020 as per US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data.While the S386 Bill had earlier been cleared by the House of Representatives (Fairness for High-Skilled Workers Act HR 1044), the version passed by the Senate has is different from the previous one.The representatives of the two houses will have to resolve the differences and reconcile it, and only then will it be passed by both Houses. The final nod to the bill has to come from President Donald Trump.So far, the White House hasn`t given any indication about whether the president will sign the bill or veto it.Share this:TweetWhatsAppShare on TumblrPocketTelegramLike this:Like Loading...TAGSH1-B VisaImmigrants ActImmigration ReformIT ProfessionalsUnited States SenateUS VisaPrevious article3% hike in DA from January for West Bengal state govt employees: CMNext articleSiemens Gamesa fired India executive over lack of due diligence in consultancy dealingsSightsIn Plushttps://sightsinplus.com/SightsIn Plus is an India’s leading high-quality people-focused monthly HR Magazine and provides up-to-date HR News, Leadership Announcements, Best HR Practices and Insights by Global CHROs, CEOs, HR Advisors, Business Managers and HR Heads on topics of interest to HR professionals.
