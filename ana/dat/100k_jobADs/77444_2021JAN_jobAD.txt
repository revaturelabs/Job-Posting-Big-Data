All those hired through the AARP will work those earlier shifts, as chief people officer for McDonald’s U.S.A Melissa Kersey explains its younger employees (who make up the majority of their workforce) are \"in school or aren't always excited about working that 5 a.m. shift, so we believe matching this mature workforce with the breakfast and lunch shift ... is really important.''The AARP and AARP Foundation released a statement as well, explaining their excitement for the partnership to come: \"We know that employees and employers across all industries succeed when they remain committed in words and in action to hiring and maintaining an age diverse workforce. Integrating these workers with their younger staff can often bring unexpected benefits including two-way mentoring which supports growth for all.\"Something else that AARP and McDonald's believes will make the \"mature\" set invaluable? Their “soft skills.\" The 55-and-up group tends to be more punctual and is able to more easily connect with customers because of their years already banked in the workforce, which is, of course, crucial in the restaurant industry.All of these job openings will be posted to the AARP's job board in Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and North Carolina.
