After your hard work drafting your CV, making applications and interviewing it’s a pretty great feeling. Imagine how disappointing it would feel to have only one average job offer – or none at all!Tailoring your CV to each application, applying for more than one job, and being clear about what the ‘best’ job offer looks like to you will land you in the fortunate position of multiple offers. So how do you do it, and what comes next? This guide gives you the insight you need.Communicate with your recruiterA recruitment consultant will be your greatest ally throughout the process of job seeking – especially if they are familiar with your industry and its finer details. In order for them to help you, you need to help them. That means making sure your CV is up to date and tailored for each position you apply for. Be honest with your recruiter about what you want to achieve – personally and professionally. Be clear about what you’ll compromise on, what’s a no-go, and you’ll get the best offer for you.Giving your notice and handling your ex-employerSome mutual respect and diplomacy on your part should avoid a tricky situation. These tips will help you manage the process:Be respectful when giving your notice. A long list of your employer’s shortcomings will leave a bitter taste and will burn bridges faster than you can say ‘gasoline’. Have a face-to-face conversation with your direct manager and follow up in writing.Prepare for your departure by respectfully notifying clients and reassuring them that they’ll be in good hands going forwards. Ensure you prepare a thorough handover for your replacement to pick up. This will make the transition smoother for your employer and shows you to be the professional you are.Take a step back, but don’t slack. After you’ve handed over with clients and colleagues your workload may decrease. It’s probably better not to attend client meetings from this point on, as they may be concerned about the sharing of sensitive information. However, under no circumstances should you take it easy. It leaves a bad impression – you didn’t start your time with the business that way, so don’t end it that way.Remember, the business world is smaller than you think and you don’t want any unsavoury news to reach your new employer’s ears.Counter offers: what to do if you receive oneIt sounds like a fairytale: you hand in your notice then your boss offers you a pay rise and a host of concessions that you had only dreamed about until now. Great! No need to move after all.As we all know, fairytales aren’t real. And yet candidates do receive counter offers as businesses seek to hold onto talent post-recession and with the uncertain future of Brexit looming. So, is a counter offer the answer to your prayers? The figures would suggest otherwise, with as many as 80% of people who accept a counter offer leaving or being let go within six months.Think carefully before accepting a counter offer. Will it help you achieve your personal or professional goals? Will it remove the doubts you had about your future with the business? If your answers to these questions are not hard and fast ‘Yeses’, it may be better to politely decline.Preparing for your next challengeArriving at your new job rested, positive and ready is vital to getting the next stage of your career off to the best start. Whether you have a holiday between roles or just a weekend, it’s important that you allow yourself time to mentally check out of your old job.Spend some time thinking through your achievements and skills and remind yourself how they fit with the job description. This will boost your confidence and help put any nerves at ease. Iron your clothes, polish your shoes and plan your route to work in advance to avoid last-minute stress on the day. Arriving with a positive, can-do attitude will make all the difference to your first day and beyond.The best job offer is the one that’s best for youLanding the best job offer possible is about landing a job offer that best meets your needs. Does it provide the salary you’ve asked for? Does it allow you to work three days a week? Can you work from home or from a regional office, rather than a central HQ? You are in the best position to answer those questions and find the right path for you. A recruiter can be your guide to getting you there.So, if you’re struggling to get the offers you want, why not download our latest guide or give us a call on 01772 259 121 - we’d be happy to help.And if you’re still at interview stage, why not have a look at our interview checklist for some top tips?
