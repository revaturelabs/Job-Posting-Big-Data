CDL schools pop up all the time in the form of small mom-and-pop operations with two trucks and a trailer for an office. These operations are interested in only one thing, taking your money. They have no track record with the State Licensing Agency. They have no history of graduation rates for you to examine. They have no relationships with the major trucking companies. And most importantly, they can’t offer placement assistance should you lose your first job.What Is Their CDL Track Record?Does the school give you info about its graduation completion percentage and employment numbers and percentages?Does The CDL Truck Driver School Provide Job Placement Assistance?Do they have full-time employees who help find you a job? Many schools offer only training and then throw you to the wolves to find your own job.Do They Have A creatable CDL Truck Driving employment placement Website?Is the website useful to you? Do they provide you with all the information you need to evaluate them and to make an informed decision? Does their website answer YOUR questions about the cdl truck driving industry? If not, they are most likely either a small-time operation or a fly-by-night scam. If they do have a website, is it just nice and flashy? Does it actually provide you with their contact information, who they train for, and cdl truck driving job placement assistance?Is it a contract cdl truck driving course?Does the cdl school train for all major carriers and then place you in a employment contract? Some truck driving schools don’t advertise themselves as contract trainers. These schools simply train for a pre-hired position with that company. If it’s not a contract training school, they will have all cdl companies offering you positions. Depending on your circumstances should determine whether you go to a school or a pre-hired position.Are They A 3rd Party CDL Tester?Some states allow a truck driving school to employ their own cdl testers on-site. Other states restrict CDL testing to only state facilities. If 3rd party cdl testing is allowed in your state, does the school offer 3rd party cdl testing on-site? Only the very best truck driving school is allowed by state governments to maintain cdl 3rd party testing due to the large amount of documentation and regulation necessary. If a school isn’t a licensed cdl 3rd party tester, you may find delays waiting in line with the graduates of all the other cdl truck driving schools to take the CDL exam at a state facility, and you will end up waiting to start your new job.What Is The Ratio Of Students To Instructors?A student ratio that’s too high means you won’t get the hands-on cdl truck driving time and one-on-one instruction you need to become a skilled and competent truck driver.If you would like more information on Free CDL truck driving schools, freecdlschools.com is a great place to check out to learn about new opportunities.Other links that could describe Driving job duties:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trucking_industry_in_the_United_Stateshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_driverhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3ATruck_driverhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivinghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_professional_driver_typeshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driverhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_driverhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_driver%27s_licenseLocation : Sierra Vista,AZZip : 85650-85635-85613-85670-85671Quick NavigationSet Up Driving Job AlertsMy Account PageAccount RegistrationContact UsFacebookTwitter© CDLBoards.com All Rights Reserved.
