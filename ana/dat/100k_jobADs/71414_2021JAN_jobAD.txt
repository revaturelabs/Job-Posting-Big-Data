"The Relevance of Emotional Intelligence in Personnel Selection for High Emotional Labor Jobs - Flight Attendant Health CollaborationTwitterFacebookAboutTeamResearchJoin StudyFlight Health AppNewsContactSearchMenu MenuThe Relevance of Emotional Intelligence in Personnel Selection for High Emotional Labor Jobs	April 28, 2016 /in Current Studies /by anthonywbrownAlthough a large number of studies have pointed to the potential of emotional intelligence (EI) in the context of personnel selection, research in real-life selection contexts is still scarce. The aim of the present study was to examine whether EI would predict Assessment Center (AC) ratings of job-relevant competencies in a sample of applicants for the position of a flight attendant. Applicants’ ability to regulate emotions predicted performance in group exercises. However, there were inconsistent effects of applicants’ ability to understand emotions: Whereas the ability to understand emotions had a positive effect on performance in interview and role play, the effect on performance in group exercises was negative. We suppose that the effect depends on task type and conclude that tests of emotional abilities should be used judiciously in personnel selection procedures.Share this entryShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare by Mailhttps://www.fahealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HavardLogo1-300x110.png 0 0 anthonywbrown https://www.fahealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HavardLogo1-300x110.png anthonywbrown2016-04-28 00:00:002016-04-28 00:00:00The Relevance of Emotional Intelligence in Personnel Selection for High Emotional Labor JobsHarvard FA HealthFollow105218Flight Attendant Health Study conducted by the Harvard T.H.
