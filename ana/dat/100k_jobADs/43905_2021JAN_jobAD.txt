The center compasses the full spectrum of fundamental research through population sciences to health care research. The DZNE stands for excellence in research and science management, translation of scientific results into practice, interdisciplinarity and internationalization. It is a research center within the Helmholtz Organization of German research centers. With over 1,000 employees from 60 nations, spread over 10 sites, the DZNE is one of the national and international leading research centers in its research field.The DZNE in Bonn is looking for twoPhD students (f/m/d) in Circuit NeuroscienceCode 1805/2020/5to join the newly established “Functional Diversity of Neural Circuits” group led by Sabine Krabbe. We combine cutting-edge circuit neuroscience tools such as in vivo deep-brain calcium imaging in behaving mice with opto- and pharmacogenetics, anatomical tracings as well as molecular and histological techniques to understand how the brain integrates internal states with environmental stimuli to flexibly control behavioural output. We are further investigating how dysfunction of the same neural circuits contributes to psychiatric symptoms in neurodegenerative disorders (see also https://www.dzne.de/en/research/research-areas/fundamental-research/research-groups/krabbe).Your tasksSuccessful candidates will actively participate in study design, experimental work, data analyses and interpretation of results. They are expected to prepare manuscripts for publication in international scientific journals and will present their results at local, national, and international conferences. PhD students will work independently on their own project under direct PI supervision, but also collaborate with other lab members.RequirementsWe are looking for two PhD students with a keen interest in neural circuit research. Applicants should hold a master's degree in Biological Sciences (e.g. Neuroscience, Life Sciences, Biomedical Science) or related disciplines, or be in the final stages of completing their studies. Any prior experience with the relevant techniques (e.g. imaging approaches, electrophysiology, stereotaxic surgery or mouse behaviour) will be considered a plus but not a prerequisite. Extensive training will be provided. We are seeking highly motivated individuals with excellent organizational and communication skills and very good language proficiency in English.We offerThe DZNE in Bonn offers an excellent scientific infrastructure with state-of-the-art research facilities. Team members will benefit from an international, collaborative environment alongside other labs focusing on systems neuroscience and neurodegenerative disorders, both within the institute and at neighbouring university departments. Postdocs and PhD students in the lab will receive extensive scientific training and will additionally be provided with opportunities for career development at the DZNE Career Centre. Salary and social benefits will be comparable to other research institutes. The positions are available from October 2020 and are initially limited to 3 years.We are looking forward to your application consisting of a cover letter stating your motivation and research interests, a CV with publication list, as well as two of the usual references. Interviews will first be conducted via video conferencing, followed by a possible on-site visit to Bonn later. Applications will be considered until the positions are filled. For further information and informal enquiries (not applications), please contact Sabine Krabbe (sabine.krabbe@dzne.de).You will obtain special skills and knowledge for your scientific qualification at DZNE. The DZNE is an equal opportunity employer. It is committed to employing disabled individuals and especially encourages them to apply.Please apply via: https://jobs.dzne.de/en/jobs/40550/formMore searches like thisIndependent Research Institute Other Neurodegenerative Disorders & Injury jobs in GermanySendSaveYou need to sign in or create an account to saveBack to topSearch EmployersAbout UsTerms & ConditionsFAQEngage with SfNJoinGiveAdvocatePublishQuick LinksSfN NewsFor PressCalendarContact UsAdvertiseCode of ConductJobs at SfNFollow SfNFacebookTwitterInstagramLinked InYouTubeRSS Feed1121 14th Street NW, Suite 1010, Washington, D.C. 20005(202) 962-4000© 2020 - 2021 Society for Neuroscience.
