However, some opportunities may require that candidates submit these documents by e-mail. In both cases, these documents are decisive for your success in these competitive selection processes. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance that your documents are carefully reviewed! This is exactly what our award-winning team will do for you.At OpenIGO, we have analyzed documents from dozens of UN candidates. This service is confidential and your files will be deleted from our systems when the service has been completed.A review of your documents will be carried out in two stages:Proofreading – highly qualified native English proofreaders will check your writing, formatting, correct errors and suggest improvements;Technical review – a team formed of PhD professors with vast experience at intergovernmental organizations will carry out a technical review of the documents that you submit to the UN selection process, offering feedback for improvement. The fit of your documents with the UN policies and strategies will be evaluated. However, we also highlight that our team will not write your CV/Resume or Cover Letter nor prepare any other documents for you. Our aim is to enhance your application. The merit of passing the selection process is all yours.Why is it worth buying our application review?It is a service of extremely high quality and care. A professor, with extensive knowledge of international organizations’ selection processes, carries out a technical review that, on average, takes 3.5 hours.

Their ebook is extremely informative and a very easy read. Using it, I was able to put forth a strong application and made it all the way through to the interview in this very competitive selection process. The book helps you to familiarise yourself with the WBG, and guides you to be able to write the strongest essay, CV and dissertation abstracts possible, given its chapters dedicated to them. Having made it so far with their help, I signed on to the mock interview service, and likewise, was not disappointed! Getting stuck on the first question the interviewers asked me helped me to realise that I had not focused enough on the basics, and with this knowledge, I prepped more efficiently for the final few days before and I passed! Thanks to OpenIGO. To all those who will embark on this journey, invest well!”“Great service! The mock interview and book significantly improved my performance at the interview”“Very happy I heard about OpenIGO during my application proces, even though it was only once I started preparing for the interview/assessment stage. I doubted at first because of the cost, but I’m extremely happy I made the investment, because both the ebook and mock interview proved very useful. The mock interview was with two people who took almost 1,5 hours AND they came prepared, which is much more than the 40 mins I expected. Thanks a lot!”“The mock interview was really useful. Particularly John Tude gave many advice which really help me to be more confident”.“Definitely worth it. As someone who went in without a clear idea of what would be expected, the ebook and mock interview were incredibly informative. I particularly appreciated the feedback at the end”.“The application review service was essential for me to go on to the next rounds and be interviewed by the YPP team. It’s true I was not selected this time, but OpenIGO really helped me reach where I did in this competitive selection.
