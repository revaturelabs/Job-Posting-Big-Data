You read that right: workplace nap. In the past, nappers have been stigmatized as lazy, but that’s no longer the case. More and more organizations (Google and HubSpot, to name a few) are jumping on the bedwagon by introducing sleep pods or nap rooms to the workplace. And the benefits your employees and business will reap are pretty surprising.Overworked SocietyThe US is one of the most overworked nations. A study by the United Nations revealed how many employed Americans are working more than 40 hours per week:85.8% of males66.5% of femalesAmericans are tired. Not to mention, Brookings found that families used to earn a median income by working 2800 hours in 1975. But now they’re working 3500 hours. With the disproportionate rise of inflation compared to income, Americans are working twice as hard to stay afloat. So isn’t it time we all get a break?Increased AbilitiesTaking a quick nap at work shouldn’t be frowned upon. In fact, NASA ran a study by allowing military pilots and astronauts to take 40-minute naps. And the results? There was a 34% increase in performance and a shocking 100% in alertness. Naps don’t have to be that long to work. Even a 20-minute nap does wonders for productivity and creativity, according to WebMD.We’ve all experienced the midafternoon crash when your brain becomes muddled. So instead of having your employees fight their yawns, let them take power naps. They’ll be more alert and able to focus on whatever task is at hand.Forget JoeCoffee is great for the morning, but when we start feeling that afternoon crash, it’s very tempting to reach for another cup. However, according to the University of California Lab of Sleep and Behavioral Neuroscience, naps are better than coffee when it comes to improving verbal memory, motor skills, and perceptual learning.So imagine how beneficial this is when an employee is still in training or if they’re learning a new software. They’re able to better retain information on whatever they’re learning. And even better, with heightened perceptual learning, new hires will be able to better understand the organization’s culture.So if you want to get the most productivity out of your employees, give them a break. Make napping a part of your organizational culture.RELATED POSTS:Building An Organizational Culture Of TransparencyHow SkyMall Can Give You An Enviable Organizational CultureSabrina SonMarch 09, 2015SUBSCRIBE Get the best advice on employee engagement and company culture.Get Our Most Helpful ResourcesHow to Create an Inclusive Workplace [Diversity and Inclusion Employee Survey Template Included]What Is a Company Mission Statement and How Can You Create Your Own?Updated: Free WFH Essentials for COVID-19 Impacted LeadersSubscribe to the TINYpulse blogDon’t miss out on the best tips on employee engagement and company culture.Subscribe Here!+1 (206) 455 9424 - Success Stories - Integrations - Support - Careers - BlogTerms and Conditions - Privacy Policy - Copyright © 2020 TINYpulse"
