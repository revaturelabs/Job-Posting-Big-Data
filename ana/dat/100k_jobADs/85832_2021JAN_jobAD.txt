Global warming, fracking and pollution of our water, air and land are tough problems with profound consequences.Lucky for us, we don’t need to invent solutions like solar panels or the electric car. They already exist.The real challenge in solving these problems is convincing our leaders to stop pandering to big polluters and start getting behind real solutions.That’s what we do.Global Warming Solutions TeamPresident Obama has proposed what The New York Times called the “strongest action ever taken by an American president to tackle climate change.” The plan would limit—for the first time ever—carbon pollution from dirty power plants. Unfortunately, the climate science deniers in Congress are threatening to block the president’s plan. Environment America’s global warming team is mobilizing climate defenders to speak up and take action.Learn More & Available PositionsClean Water For America TeamDo you think we should be doing everything we can to protect our waterways? We do too. Unfortunately, polluting industries have put our waters in jeopardy by carving loopholes in the law that leave more than half of America’s streams open to pollution. So Environment America’s clean water team is backing the Environmental Protection Agency's plan to close the loopholes so they can enforce the law and stop the polluters.Learn More & Available PositionsClean Energy TeamAmericans are going solar, meeting more of our energy needs in a way that’s clean, local and independent. Unfortunately, dirty energy companies are putting up new roadblocks at every turn. Our research shows that when states and cities adopt the right policies, families and businesses are more than willing to go solar—even in states that don’t get much sunshine. That’s why Environment America’s clean energy team is urging governors and mayors in 14 states to make commitments that will help America get to 10 percent solar by 2020.Learn More & Available PositionsFeatured PositionsWe're hiring for key leadership positions with our state organizations.
