This sense is not based on hard data; rather it is based on a sense of what I hear in briefings and what types of briefings I am seeing. The message of recovery is not a new one, but over the previous year or two it felt like the undertone of the message was more of a hope than a sentiment of fact. The undertone now suggests that there may be more than just hopeful optimism to the message today.Are you seeing more opportunities for embedded developers than the previous year or two? Is the workload growing as well as the talent being brought to bear on these projects, or are you doing more with much less? If you can provide an anecdote, please do; otherwise, use the scale below to indicate how you think the market for embedded developers is doing.1) The embedded market is hurting so much that improvement/growth is hard to detect.2) The embedded market is showing signs of revival but still has a ways to go to be healthy.3) The embedded market is healthy.4) The embedded market is growing and hiring opportunities are up.5) The future has never looked brighter.6) Other (please expand)Tags: Embedded Market, JobsPosted in Question of the Week | No Comments »Processor Tracker - Real-time updates for select processors and development toolsEmbedded Insights Channels HomeSearch for:RSS FeedsAll Entries RSS FeedAll Comments RSS FeedArticle Archives» By Publish DateRecent EntriesArchive Mode and Encore InfoEclipse and NetBeans replacing embedded IDEs (part 3)Eclipse and NetBeans replacing embedded IDEs (part 2)Eclipse and NetBeans replacing embedded IDEs (part 1)One Picture Is Worth a Thousand WordsRecent CommentsLutz on Are you, or would you consider, using a 4-bit microcontroller?Jeet on Do you ever think about endianess?lol on Are you, or would you consider, using a 4-bit microcontroller?BP on To MMU or not to MMU?Ed Stark on The Express Traffic Lane (It’s Not the Computer, It’s How You Use It)Channels (Info)ARM Architecture (4)Automation (2)Certification (2)Computers & Peripherals (2)Education & Training (3)Energy Management (9)Exploration & Prototyping (6)Extreme Processing (25)Machine Sensing (3)Medical (2)Multiprocessing (5)Power Architecture (1)Project Management (8)Question of the Week (107)Random Insights (16)Robotics (3)Robust Design (38)Security & Encryption (7)Simulation & Debugging (12)Software Techniques (25)Speech (1)User Interfaces (35)Verification & Validation (7)Video & Imaging (2)Voices of Industry (22)Article Archives» By Publish Date© Copyright 2010-2012 Embedded Insights Inc.
