If you're presently teaching, definitely request an employment verification letter or certificate from your employer.By the way, you've mentioned that you're completing an MA TESOL while living in the UAE. If your MA program includes any online coursework, be aware your degree won't be accepted by the governments of KSA, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.Back to topAmericanAminaJoined: 15 Dec 2015Posts: 104Location: Abu Dhabi, UAEPosted: Sun Nov 13, 2016 8:02 am Post subject:nomad soul wrote:By the way, you've mentioned that you're completing an MA TESOL while living in the UAE.

It's problematic completing my MA this way, but we're already living and working abroad. I'm hoping that graduating at the same brick-and-mortar where I was taking in-person classes before might make a difference. I know that sometimes the rules are also \"flexible\" if you know somebody, and in Saudi we still have some connections. I realize it's a shot in the dark.Back to topnomad soulJoined: 31 Jan 2010Posts: 11454Location: The real worldPosted: Sun Nov 13, 2016 9:03 am Post subject:AmericanAmina wrote:nomad soul wrote:By the way, you've mentioned that you're completing an MA TESOL while living in the UAE.

The colleges of excellence (i.e., vocational schools) would be interested in you.Back to topveiledsentimentsJoined: 20 Feb 2003Posts: 17644Location: USAPosted: Sun Nov 13, 2016 4:04 pm Post subject:AmericanAmina wrote:I don't have an employment verification letter from anyone I ever worked for.

I'm American and have never heard of this concept.No American has ever heard of such a thing since out systems don't use them. I would attempt to contact those that you can and get the letters. I did so with the county adult ed and my ex-supervisor was happy to do it for me. They may be helpful in the future around the Gulf.VSBack to topAmericanAminaJoined: 15 Dec 2015Posts: 104Location: Abu Dhabi, UAEPosted: Mon Nov 14, 2016 9:54 am Post subject:Nomad, my BA was done in person years ago, so I do still have that in my favor. Maybe that will be enough in cases where the MA that was mostly online will work against me.VS, honestly! Who ever heard of such a thing? But I guess I better get to work gathering those up.Back to topsheikhitnowJoined: 29 Dec 2017Posts: 32Posted: Mon May 21, 2018 8:14 pm Post subject:For what it's worth, in the past both my Saudi and UAE employers accepted standard reference letters as proof of employment. After all, a signed and stamped reference letter from a supervisor is proof that you worked there. If prospective employers needed previous salaries, which was seldom, tax records sufficed.Back to topfhqJoined: 21 Apr 2014Posts: 14Posted: Sun Jul 21, 2019 10:55 pm Post subject: Re: The skinny on direct-hire university opportunitiesnomad soul wrote:But in a nutshell, a TESOL-related masters degree + a year or two of relevant experience satisfies the requirements for a direct-hire spot at a Saudi university.Is this still the case? I'm finishing up my M.Ed. in the US and wondering if direct hire in KSA is an option. I've worked there for a few years in the past through a recruiting agency, but with the business visa trend nowadays I would need something where I have the option to bring family.Back to topveiledsentimentsJoined: 20 Feb 2003Posts: 17644Location: USAPosted: Mon Jul 22, 2019 2:04 am Post subject:I doubt it. Most of the universities that used to direct hire have seemed to go to sub-contractors.VSBack to topdesertdawgJoined: 14 Jun 2010Posts: 206Posted: Mon Jul 22, 2019 6:32 am Post subject:I would apply.
