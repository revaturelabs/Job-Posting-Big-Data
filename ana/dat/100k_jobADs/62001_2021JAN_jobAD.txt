Thanks to Asher, I now have a new role that offers the career change, progression and challenge that I have been looking to achieve for quite some time.\"Business Operations Manager - Placed CandidateRail Delivery Group\"‘’The whole process was a pleasure. Asher was incredibly professional and helpful throughout. When the position at RDG was presented I was very keen to learn more and when I contacted Asher he took his time to present the role in great detail, he also answered my questions and some concerns that I had based on my recent employment search. Following this it was agreed for me to come in and meet face to face. On doing so I found Asher to be very welcoming and engaging. He presented the position at RDG in detail and had clearly understood my CV before hand in respect to having the right questions to hand in the meeting. It gave me the opportunity to relax and open up about my initial thoughts towards the position. On leaving the meeting I was confident that Asher was going to present me in the best possible light and I had confidence in the process from that point forward. Asher managed my expectations perfectly throughout the process; always being in touch when he said he would and making available all pertinent information as and when needed. In some cases I was busy and not always able to answer the phone, but Asher would always leave a message and ensure that contact was made when required. In the end I was offered the position and I subsequently accepted. That is always a good news story but the real story here is how easy the whole process was – in fact it was a pleasure – that was down to the excellent level of service and attention received from Asher and the fact that I felt like he had my back throughout. I would heartily recommend Asher & AMC Professional for any potential candidates’’. \"Change & Release Analyst - Placed CandidateRail Delivery Group\"I was headhunted by Asher not that long ago for a role that I was slightly hesitant to take a look at, merely as I had just a week before started a temp role. Asher was very keen to speak with me as he felt the role was very well suited for me and to my delight the role was indeed perfect. Throughout the whole 1st & 2nd interview process Asher was very supportive, he sent me lots of information on the people who would be interviewing me and who I would be working with had I been successful getting the role. His support certainly helped ease my nerves going into the interview and allowed me to feel extra prepared, which in turn allowed me to deliver in both interviews. Asher unlike some recruiters I have worked with in the past, certainly cares about his candidates and wants to get the best role suitable for you. I can’t thank him enough for approaching me with the role and for all the support he gave me throughout the whole process, I love the new job and look forward to developing my career within the company. \"Corporate Services Team Assistant - Placed CandidateSunoptic\"Really happy with the personal touch provided by Asher. We met initially and Asher was clear about the qualification and experience required for the role as well as considering if they would be the right fit for our business. All candidates were then vetted and he met them personally. This saved me time and I was provided with a good selection of candidates to interview. What I liked was the honest and upfront nature to ensure the person was right for the business. \"Head of Finance - SunopticCDW (Formaly Kelway Plc)\"Although the relationship is very new, the quality of candidates are very good indeed.
