The demonstrated ability to work well with members of the public is also important.\"Patrick has said that the docket for Chancery Court for Monday (July 10) is one of the largest he has ever compiled.That should make for an interesting Monday morning, since Patrick has also said he has no desire or plans to continue and is anxious to devote his energies to his other role as the Mayor of Woodbury.Maybe by then I'll be able to report what I know — that Corlew has named someone to the position — rather than what I've heard, none of which has been much of a secret to anyone following the situation.Read more from:CANNON COMMUNITYTags:NoneShare:Comment Email PrintMembers Opinions:CannonCourier[Delete]July 11, 2010 at 10:33amI have received a few communiques questioning the fairness of the process of selecting the Clerk and Master, and have formed the following thoughts:Fair? There are many things in life that are not fair, and never will be.I've expressed to my boss several times in the past year that it is not fair that I have this job. There are many people more talented, more experienced and better educated who he could hire. I am extremely fortunate to have this position.The process of selecting a Clerk and Master is not set up to be fair. The only way it could be is if it were an elected position.In a process by which the selection of the person for the job is done by picking from a number of applicants, there is only going to be one person who thinks the process is fair when it is over.I have also had comments that the same people always seem to be under consideration for positions such as this one. There are many reasons for that:• There are a number of families within the community that have been around for many decades, if not for over a century. During that time members of those families have established themselves in the local political, business and social scenes — some in all three. That is the case in all communities, but is more apparent and prominent in smaller ones.• The Good Ole Boys (and Girls) Networks. Notice I included both sexes, and used network in the plural form. All kinds of associations of people exist here, as everywhere. Some have the same objectives, but different ideas on how to reach them. Some come from different social and educational backgrounds and have political views, but work together pretty well. Some are totally opposed to each other.• Sometimes these networks stay around for a long person of time, sometimes they come and go, never to be heard from again. For example, there are over 50 \"networks\" of people working to get their candidate elected in the upcoming election, and come August 6 the majority of them will have disbursed.JimmyP[Delete]July 11, 2010 at 1:08pmWell I would hope that it is not Steve Smith. He is the President of First National Bank in Murfreesboro. How does being President of a bank all your life qualify you to be a Clerk & Master? It is always about the good old boy politics in this town. It is either a Jennings or a Smith that comes out smelling like roses. You named seven people you knew that had applied for the job and two of them were lawyers, one was in law school and the one female of the bunch has worked in the office doing the job for 15 years, but it is always a Smith or Jennings that gets picked. Someone please explain how this process was fair?[Delete]July 11, 2010 at 10:49pmCongratulations to Mr. Patrick on a job well done. Cannon County should be so fortunate to find a replacement for someone that has handled this office is such an efficient and effective manner. Good luck in your future endeavors.nasrville[Delete]July 12, 2010 at 10:00amHat's off to the Cannon Courier for a great article. Just to get the facts exactly right, Steve Smith is NOT the president of First National Bank, he is a Loan Officer and according to their website is not on the Board nor is he listed as a Vice President.Shopping & ServicesCOMMUNICATIONSDTC SecurityCOMMUNITYWear A MaskCOUNSELINGChandy Powell, MAEDUCATIONMTSUEVENTSBargain HuntFINANCIAL SERVICESCapstar BankFOODPiggly WigglySophia's On the SquareWarehouse Discount GroceryFUNERAL SERVICESSmith Funeral HomeWoodbury Funeral HomeWoodbury Funeral MonumentsFURNITURE & APPLIANCESPaul L.
