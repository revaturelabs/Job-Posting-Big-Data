In the heat of the summer, it is very important to make sure you stay healthy and hydrated to prevent heat exhaustion. Here are a few easy tips from LaborQuick, Greenville NC’s premier construction staffing agency, that will ensure that you stay safe during the dog days of summer.Drink Plenty Of FluidsThe most obvious way to beat the heat while on a job site is to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day. If you wait until you are thirsty, chances are you are already dehydrated. LaborQuick construction staffing agency challenges you to drink 100 ounces of water per day while working outside, as well as additional healthy drinks that will provide your body with extra electrolytes. When doing extreme activities during hot weather, you will need to replace sodium and potassium for optimal electrolyte balance. Something as simple as drinking enough water can potentially save you from dehydration or heat exhaustion.Dress AppropriatelyWearing lightweight and light-colored clothes is another way to help beat the heat while on a job site. LaborQuick construction staffing agency suggests wearing a long sleeve shirt that is made of moisture-wicking material, and lightweight work pants that dry fast. If you must wear a short sleeved shirt, be sure to apply sunscreen regularly throughout the day to avoid getting sunburnt. Wear sunglasses when possible to protect your eyes, and a hat to protect your scalp when not wearing a hardhat. Wrapping a cold washcloth or towel that has been sitting in ice-cold water is a great way to cool off too. Wear it around your neck or apply it to your wrists or ankles to quickly cool off your body temperature if you feel like you are getting too hot.Eat RightYou want to be sure not to overeat while working outside in extreme heat, but you also don’t want to skip meals either. In fact, eating healthy low-calorie snacks throughout the day is another great way to avoid dehydration. LaborQuick construction staffing agency suggests snacking on water-rich foods, which are composed primarily of water. Watermelon, strawberries, grapefruit, cabbage, and carrots are great snacks to eat to keep your body healthy and hydrated.Get Plenty Of RestGetting an adequate amount of sleep is necessary when working outside in the heat. LaborQuick construction staffing agency stresses the importance of paying attention to your body before you get overheated. If you start to feel dizzy or lightheaded, find a cool place to sit and take a break. You know your body better than anyone else, so always be on the lookout for signs of heat exhaustion. Heavy sweating, faintness, dizziness, fatigue, weak or rapid pulse, low blood pressure upon standing, and muscle cramps are common signs of heat exhaustion. Always let your boss or co-workers know if you aren’t feeling like yourself and take breaks when needed.Look Out For Each OtherJust because you now know the best practices when it comes to beating the heat while working on a job site according to LaborQuick construction staffing agency, doesn’t mean your co-workers know. Always be on the lookout for the signs of heat exhaustion mentioned earlier. Do not hesitate to call 911! While you’re waiting for paramedics to get to the scene, attempt to move them to a cooler area, remove any unnecessary clothing, provide drinking water and turn on a fan in their direction, or mist them with water.Contact UsFirst Name:Last NamePhone:Email:Message:Thank you!
