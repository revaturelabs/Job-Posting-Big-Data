Please refer to these sites to see the kind of thing weâ€™re afterCompany nameWorkFrontWhat's your vision?Tagline: \"What's on the WorkFront?\" Desired Color Scheme: see design brief Desired Style: see design brief Accepted File Formats: Standard Web Formats (.jpg, .gif or .png) The main requirement is branding.Â Weâ€™d like a clear, concise, professional look to our brand, as our forte is to provide users with opportunities to professional careers. Our requirements are listed in order of priority:Â Â LOGO: This must be our company name: WorkFront.Â Weâ€™d like to retain this as a single word, although it is spelt correctly as two words.Â Â Â Desired Color Scheme:Â Please utilise easy on the eye colours like blue/orange/green â€“ but weâ€™ll accept other designs if they look good i.e. blue/blackÂ which isÂ similar to Jobserve, so maybe Blue/Orange or Green/Red â€“ You Decide!!! We'llÂ welcome any colour combination you think!Â Please centre the logo focus on a Recruitment/Work/Job theme i.e. aÂ person/people or a hand shake or even something that visually stays in people's mind, or something to do with progression, succeeding,Â supporting/service providerÂ etc.Â Logo must also be inviting to recruitment agencies somehow too as well as users.Â Accepted File Formats: Standard Web Formats (.jpg, .gif or .png)Â Â SLOGAN: This is: â€œWhat's on the WorkFront?â€ (can be in italics or whatever you choose).Â You may want to incorporate this as part of the logo, rather than have WorkFront twice.Â Look at maybe doing something with both O's in Work and Front. STATIONARY: We would appreciate our LOGO, possibly even SLOGAN presented on the following stationary items (European standard formats):Â -Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Business cards (9cm x 5.1cm) â€“ a double sided design is also possible -Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Compliment slip (20.9cm x 10cm) -Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Letterhead (standard A4) -Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Envelopes (standard C5-6 ->Â 23cm x 11.4cm) Â FLASH ANIMATION: This must be simple, not over complicated, and can be something innovative, related to people or simply even something that incorporates our brand.Â Its Important this is not large, as we are not creating a complicated, slow website.Â This animation should provide progression, a step in the right direction, the way forward.
