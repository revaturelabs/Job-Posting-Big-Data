You’ll learn the ins and outs of public information, how to file and pursue an open records request, and how to interpret the resulting data for audiences.This internship is the perfect fit for a student who has been bitten by the reporting bug and wants to expand their know-how with hands-on, real-world experience. You’ll work under an award-winning investigative journalist who will push you to do more than you realize you’re capable of. Our goal is for you to walk away with strong additions to your portfolio. Some work and meetings will take place in Dallas, but much of it can be accomplished via web meetings and remotely. (NOTE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the safety and well-being of our interns will take precedence over in-person reporting.)Your work will be part of groundbreaking efforts on the part of a new Dallas news nonprofit. We focus our community journalism efforts in South Dallas and West Dallas, two historically redlined neighborhoods, and that work informs collaborative projects that tackle complex civic issues with solutions journalism. South Dallas is predominantly Black, and West Dallas is predominantly Latinx with many residents whose native language is Spanish. We’re seeking interns who reflect the culture and diversity of these neighborhoods.A $1,000 stipend is available for up to two interns each semester (spring, summer, fall). Other spots are open for interns to receive academic credit. Students will be supervised by a professional journalist with dedicated meetings at least weekly and ongoing availability for questions and consults.To apply: Send a cover letter, résumé, reporting clips/work samples and references to Dallas Free Press executive director Keri Mitchell at keri@dallasfreepress.com. Applicants who proceed to an interview will be asked to complete an assigned story and data project as part of their application. Internship spots may fill before the application deadline.Schedule: Flexible hours, 15 per week (spring/fall); 20 per week (summer)Spring: Jan. 19-May 7, 2021 (Stipend deadline: Nov. 1, 2020; Academic credit: Jan. 8, 2021)Summer: May 24-Aug. 6, 2021 (Stipend deadline: April 1, 2021; Academic credit: May 14, 2021)Start and finish dates are somewhat flexible, according to your academic calendar.Apply Now	Share on TwitterShare on LinkedinShare on Facebook	Contact & LocationPhone(940) 565-2105Emailcareer.center@unt.eduAddressSage Hall, Suite 2021167 Union CircleDenton, TX 76203Career Service HoursRegular Hours	Quick Chats	M8:00am – 5:00pm	10:00am-Noon	T8:00am – 5:00pm	1:00pm-3:00pm	W8:00am – 5:00pm	10:00am-Noon	TH8:00am – 5:00pm	1:00pm-3:00pm	F8:00am – 5:00pm	10:00am-Noon	Learn how to Connect with the Career CenterRegular Hours: Appointments by phone, in-person, email and Zoom; Current students – Navigate; Alumni – Handshake.
