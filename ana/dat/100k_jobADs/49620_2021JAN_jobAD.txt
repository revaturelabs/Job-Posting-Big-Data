It was founded by Richard Warren Sears and Alvah Curtis Roebuck back in 1893. Sears, Roebuck and Co. offers a wide range of home merchandise, apparel and other products and services in more than 1,320 Sears branded and affiliated stores in the United States and Canada. The company is one of the nation’s largest retailers which has 4,000 stores in North America.HistorySears was founded by Richard Warren Sears and Alvah Curtis Roebuck in 1893. Richard Sears was a railroad station agent in Minnesota and at that time he received from a Chicago jeweler a shipment of watches which were unwanted by a local jeweler. Sears purchased them and sold the watches for another profit to other station agents then ordered more for sale. Later on he started his business selling watches through mail order catalogs. He then moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he met Alvah Roebuck, who later joined him in the business. In 1893, the company name became Sears, Roebuck & Co. And the first Sears catalog was published in 1888 and had grown to 322 pages which featured sewing machines, sporting goods, automobiles and other new items in 1894. By 1895, the company was already producing a 532 page catalog and sales became greater than $400,000 by 1893. Sears opened their catalog plant and the Sears Merchandise Building Tower in Chicago by 1906. Richard Sears and Alvah Roebuck renamed their watch company as Sears, Roebuck & Company. Roebuck decided to quit because of the full scale depression in 1895 and Sears offered Roebuck’s half of the company to Chicago businessman Aaron Nusbaum who also brought in his brother-in-law Julius Rosenwald. In August 1895, they brought Roebuck’s half of the company for $75,000 and was re-incorporated in Illinois with a capital stock of $150,000. Rosenwald was the one who brought to the mail order firm a management philosophy and varieties of product lines. His leadership as Vice President and Treasurer helped the company increase their sales upwards to $50 million. Sears began to diversify in the 1930s and established major national brands such as Silverstone, Superstone and Toughskins.Sears Warehouse JobsMaterial HandlerAs a Material Handler, you are responsible for the distribution of activities conducted in accordance with International Standards Organization 9001.
