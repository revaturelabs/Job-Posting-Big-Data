Previous project|Next project ?1 of 71 of 7Turner Construction CharlotteCharlotte, North CarolinaTurner Construction had a clear vision for its new Charlotte workplace: create an inviting and accessible environment that reflects the company’s personality and work style. The design incorporates a series of unique spaces – such as the learning lab and café – that are multi-functional and support collaboration. Pursuing LEED® certification, daylight is maximized through full-height windows and low-paneled workstations lining the perimeter. The space exhibits a clean, minimal aesthetic, with selected unfinished touches providing a subtle counterpoint and reference to the company’s real work and culture.ExpertiseInterior Design ?Professional Services ?Sustainability ?Related ContentIn The MediaInterior DesignAutodesk and Hotels.com in Interior Design’s “media...Gensler Research InstituteDesign Process InnovationHow can we improve the design process?
