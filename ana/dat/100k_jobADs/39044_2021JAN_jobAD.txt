Edelman was a great place to work, so the Comeback Club was popular.	AdvertisingI myself was a member. After working there for two years, I left Edelman New York in 2000 to work at Computer Associates in eastern Long Island. When my husband and I moved to Chicago in 2004, I went back to my roots as a digital PR strategist in the Edelman office there. It was the right decision, and I stayed with the firm another four years before going out on my own full time in 2008.A question many employees have faced is: “should I go back to my old job?” Maybe the new job wasn’t as wonderful as you thought it would be and you are now able to see your old situation more clearly. Maybe you have gained some experience that has opened up a new opportunity with people you trust. Maybe your personal circumstances have changed.	AdvertisingWhen deciding whether you should go back to your old job, consider the following five questions before making your move.1. What Led You to Leave in the First Place?It is really important to assess whether the reasons for your departure still exist. For example, if you clashed with your manager, will you be working with that person again? If the organization’s culture was toxic, are you better prepared to cope this time around? You must assume that nothing (and no one) has changed before you go back to your old job.	Advertising2. Did You Leave All of Your Bridges Intact?Take honest stock of how your departure was received. Was your behavior universally professional? Did you go above and beyond to leave your job in good hands, and was this noticed and appreciated? Before you go back to your old job, you want to be absolutely certain that there are no lingering hard feelings.3. With Whom Will You Be Working?As a former employee, you have the benefit of knowing the organization better than any brand new recruit, and you must harness this insider intelligence. Is the department you’ll be working with productive, efficient, and interpersonally mature? Ask yourself if your new manager is someone with a strong reputation, and if your team members are people with whom you can easily collaborate.	Advertising4. Will You Have to Start Over?Presumably, you had to work a while at this organization to earn respect and increasing levels of responsibility. You’ve also gained more experience since you last worked there. Will your new position reflect these developments, or will all of your previous accomplishments be for naught? No matter how desperate you may be feeling, don’t take a job that’s a step backward.5. Will the Work Be Meaningful?In making the decision to take any new job, you should reflect on what the work will be like day-to-day. Will it be a challenge you can sink your teeth into? Will you have the opportunity to make a real difference in the organization? If your progress was hampered by red tape or endless consensus building kept you from getting anything done before, it may well again.Many of us leave organizations because we later realize the old but true cliché – the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Sometimes, it takes a change in situation to realize just how great we had it. However, it’s important to objectively evaluate what we’re getting ourselves back into and not rush into a boomerang.(Photo credit: Businessman sitting on an armchair via Shutterstock)SharePin itTweetShareEmailAdvertisingAdvertisingRead NextWhen I Stopped Being Afraid To Make Mistakes, I Started To Live A Better LifeSometimes You Win, Sometimes You Learn.

Read full profileSharePin itTweetShareEmailSome people see the trees for the forest, and some see only the forest, meaning they lack strong attention to detail. But even if you’re one of the people who take a macro rather than a micro view, true professionalism requires balancing both.If focusing on the fine points is not your forte, you will benefit from training yourself to pay attention to details. You will profit by saving yourself time, effort, money, and credibility.Table of ContentsWhy Training Yourself in Attention to Details Pays Off3 Important Aspects of Becoming More Detail-Oriented12 Tips to Help You if You Lack Attention to DetailFinal ThoughtsMore Tips on Boosting Your Attention to DetailWhy Training Yourself in Attention to Details Pays OffYou add value to your organization when you make the effort to ensure that you performed your work thoroughly and effectively. This is why job postings often list “attention to details” among the required skills.When you present your supervisor or client with well-completed, high-quality work the first time, it maximizes your value and minimizes wasted time. Detail-oriented people are also more adept at catching mistakes that could lead to costly blunders.Moreover, attention to detail is an indicator of possessing other in-demand employee qualities, such as organization, thoroughness, and focus. In some professions, such as accounting, engineering, medical research, and more, you can only excel if you have trained yourself to pay attention to details.In other professions, possessing strong attention to detail is the very quality that will get you promoted to a position where you will be asked to consider the big picture.Finally, if you are the “go-to” details person, everyone else on the team can relax a bit. They know the project is in good hands and will likely throw you more projects as a reward. This will ultimately lead to your advancement.3 Important Aspects of Becoming More Detail-OrientedHere are the 3 important things you need to learn if you want to remedy your lack of attention to detail:AdvertisingRespect deadlinesUnderstand the work-flow planBuild in time to mess up1. Respect DeadlinesDeadlines lend all projects a finish line. One smart idea is to take the given deadline and work backward from it, calculating when your piece of the project is due. Then, if you stick to the proscribed schedule for completing the mini-projects that you have, you will never miss a deadline.One important note on this: It is smarter to stick to the deadline and turn in work that merits a “B+” than to blow the deadline with “A” work. Chances are, through revision and suggested changes from others on the team, you can bring up your B+ work to an A later. But if you disregard deadlines, you will lose the respect of your boss and fellow teammates.2. Understand the Work-Flow PlanYour team is developing work in conjunction with other teams who have projects and deadlines of their own. When you grasp the whole work-flow plan, you may be able to either add insight to the greater project or to your own smaller piece of it that others at the firm will consider valuable.3. Build in Time to Mess UpYou can expect that “what can go wrong will go wrong.” Don’t overpromise on deadlines. Something likely will mess up, but when it does if you built in the time to fix it, those around you won’t freak out.Chances are, you already give your attention to several details. Take heart. You can do this! You can overcome your lack of attention to detail and become more detail-oriented.For starters, consider this: Most people take the time and put in extra effort into the activities or undertakings that matter to them most. Training yourself to become more detail-oriented can mean adopting a similar pattern of behavior.Apply the same attention you give to your appearance. Are you a meticulous dresser? Do you pay attention to how you pair patterns and colors, and how you accessorize a particular outfit?This is the same system to use when you lack attention to detail with your work. Give every item careful consideration so that each one contributes to the perfectly pieced-together whole.	AdvertisingAssemble the ingredients the way you do when you cook. Cooking and baking from scratch require close attention to details as you measure and add each ingredient in sequence, and you time everything so that the meal comes together at the same time.Similarly, your work product requires you to gauge whether all the ingredients have been added and that your final product is delivered on time.Organize your business network like you do your social contacts. If you follow a broad base of friends and acquaintances on social media, you can apply similar skills to stay up-to-date on details associated with business acquaintances.When you meet somebody who could be influential to your career or a resource for improving your skills, follow that person on social media. Respond to their posts to keep the lines of communication flowing.12 Tips to Help You if You Lack Attention to DetailTeaching yourself to take note of important details involves sharpening your perceptions and thinking ahead. The following tips will help you adopt these practices. Master these habits when training yourself to become detail-oriented.1. Learn to Listen WellYou will pick up relevant information and needed nuance when you apply the skills of active listening. In conversations, train yourself to make eye contact, give your undivided attention to the speaker, and ask pertinent follow-up questions.Training yourself to pay better attention to details in conversations includes learning to fully concentrate on what others have to say. If you find it hard, there’s no harm in taking notes on what they say.2. Pay Attention to Social CuesMake a point of noticing body language and facial expressions that provide insights into how others perceive a situation. Social cues offer details that give you an understanding of how words and actions impact others. The infamous character Michael Scott of the television show “The Office” epitomizes the consequences of not paying attention to others’ body language.[1]Advertising3. Follow RulesRules and protocols usually come about from lessons learned and are put in place to avoid further mishaps—whether from a safety or efficiency standpoint. If you’re given step-by-step procedures to follow, check them off as you go. Also, return to the rules at the project’s end just to make sure you adhered to them all.4. Take NotesNote-taking is a way to boost your retention and gives you something to refer back to when you need to keep track of pertinent details. You will also heighten your focus as you listen for relevant information. Review your notes shortly after the meeting or conversation and highlight the content that you intend to apply.5. Prioritize What Needs Your Attention NowWhen you have a full slate of work that demands your attention, take a few moments to sort assignments from most to least urgent. Keep a calendar, spreadsheet, or project planning software up-to-date with schedules and deadlines to help you stay organized.As you tackle each urgent assignment, give it your full attention so no details are missed. Give yourself ample time—especially if you tend to be someone who waits until the last minute—as rushing can make you overlook important details.6. Have a Detail-Oriented Assistant Check Your WorkIf you lack attention to detail, then it makes sense to seek help from someone detail-oriented. If you have this option, take advantage of it. Two sets of eyes are better than one. Just be sure to credit your assistant for their help once the project is completed.7. Learn the Rules of Writing WellEnglish is a difficult language, and grammar, punctuation, and spelling can all sabotage you unless you pay attention to detail. When in doubt, look it up. Free to use website services such as Grammarly can help.8. Proofread Before You Hit SendNothing is perfect in its first draft. If you lack attention to detail, then put in the extra effort before submitting things. Before you send off any written work, check carefully not only for misspellings and incomplete sentences but also for improper tone, inappropriate colloquialisms, and inconsistent formatting. When your written communications are error-free, they will have their intended impact.9. Minimize DistractionsIt is impossible to stay focused when colleagues carry on conversations nearby or your mobile notifications ding you throughout the day. Do your best to limit distractions.	AdvertisingIf you are working where there is a lot of noise or side activity, try wearing noise-canceling headphones or seeking out a quiet corner. Disable your notifications when you need to focus, and resolve to only check them after you have completed your assignment.10. Take BreaksIt may sound counter-intuitive to stop and take a walk, but it’s necessary. Walk away from the screen. Moving from one task to the next across the span of your workday is a recipe for brain fatigue. Give your brain a recess time when you come to a natural stopping place or after you complete one project and before you start the next. These short pauses are necessary for sorting through all the details needed for coming up with successful solutions.11. Make Time for ReflectionAt the end of a workday, take a few minutes to go over the day’s events in your mind. What was said or relayed in conversations? What is the status of the projects you worked on? What else occurred that you should pay attention to? Could there have been any details you might have missed that you should address tomorrow?12. Keep a Detailed To-Do ListThis simple organizational tool is your best ally for getting your work done on time and for paying attention to the details. If you are pressed for time (and who isn’t?), write your list to coordinate with dayparts.Allot a certain number of hours to complete each task, do it, and then check it off. Nothing feels more rewarding than completing all the tasks on your list. But if you can’t finish them, then carry them over to the following day.Final ThoughtsDetails may seem small, but they can become a lot larger when they are overlooked. If you know you lack attention to detail, commit to training yourself to embrace the many facets that can help you consistently excel in the tasks you set out to accomplish.When you begin to catch your mistakes in advance or apply the tidbits of information you gathered from paying close attention, you will know that you have trained yourself in the fundamentals of becoming detail-oriented. After that, you should start hearing the phrase “Great job!” more often.More Tips on Boosting Your Attention to Detail7 Simple Habits to Improve Your Attention to DetailHow to Improve Focus: 7 Ways to Train Your Brain10 Things Only Detail-Oriented People DoFeatured photo credit: Cristina Gottardi via unsplash.comReference[1] ^ Clay Norris: Michael Scott Leadership AnalysisSharePin itTweetShareEmailAdvertisingAdvertisingRead NextHow to Practice Active Listening (A Step-By-Step Guide)7 Simple Habits to Improve Your Attention to DetailHow To Write Minutes of Meeting Effectively (with Examples)AdvertisingAdvertisingMore by this authorVicky OliverAuthor of 6 best-selling books on job-hunting and job interview questions, business etiquette, frugalista style, advertising, and office politics.How To Train Yourself When You Lack Attention To DetailsHow To Write Minutes of Meeting Effectively (with Examples)13 Critical Things to Consider Before Switching CareersHow to Swiftly Make a Midlife Career ChangeWhy You Are Never Too Old for College (And How To Make It Work)AdvertisingTrending in Work1 Feel like Giving Up? 16 Way to Help Entrepreneurs Stay Motivated 2 How To Train Yourself When You Lack Attention To Details 3 Make Everyone At The Office Happy By Installing This 4 10 Tools to Start an Online Business without Breaking the Bank 5 How to Become an Entrepreneur (A Serial Entrepreneur’s Advice)Read Next13 Critical Things to Consider Before Switching Careers10 Simple Yet Powerful Business Goals to Set This YearHow to Give Constructive Feedback in the WorkplaceHow To Hustle: 10 Habits Of Highly Successful HustlersAboutWrite for UsContact UsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy Policy© 2005 - 2021 Lifehack · All Rights Reserved."
