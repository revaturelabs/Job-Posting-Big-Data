and employersA wise man one said...No person will make a great business who wants to do it all himself. A goal without a plan is just a wish. To accept good advice is but to increase one's own ability. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Advice is like snow; the softer it falls, the longer it dwells upon, and the deeper it sinks into the mind. Whenever you see a successful business, someone once made a courageous decision.Quick service linksInnovation & technologyHospitality & tourismBusiness servicesLatest News0141 471 3333info@mcdougalljohnstone.co.ukMcDougall Johnstone280 St Vincent StreetGlasgowG2 5RLChartered Certified Accountantsand Business AdvisersHome | Contact us | Site map | Accessibility | Disclaimer | Help |© 2021 McDougall Johnstone.
