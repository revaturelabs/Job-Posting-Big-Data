The craftsman from France came up with a million-dollar idea to create an exceptional line of cigarette papers initialed JB. The papers were a success, and JB became known throughout the towns.On the papers, the J and the B were separated by a diamond, so consumers began calling the brand JOB. The brand name followed shortly after, and by 1849, Jean Bardou filed for a patent for \"\"Papier JOB\"\". In the 1890s, many renowned artists were brought in to design advertising posters for the brand. The brand can be seen all over the world, even starring in early films!
