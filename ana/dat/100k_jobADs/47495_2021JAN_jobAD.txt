ADRIAN LOWERY has four steps to getting some exposure to cryptocurrenciesPreviousNextDolcis collapse: jobs toll hits 700By Robert LeaUpdated: 09:46 EST, 14 February 2008ViewcommentsThe number of job victims in the New Year's collapse of the Dolcis shoe chain has topped 700.The rump of the failed chain was today sold to Stylo, the listed company behind the Shellys, Barratts and PriceLess shoe shops. Of the 67 Dolcis shops that were trading before Christmas, almost two-thirds have now closed, with about half the smaller outlets also shut down.Administrators fromKPMG took over running Dolcis last month, immediately laying off 482 staff. Another 18 stores were closed today with the loss of a further 229 jobs as the administrators sold 24 stores to Stylo. About 300 Dolcis workers have transferred to Stylo.It appears the Dolcis name will live on as Stylo, run by Michael Ziff and controlled by his family, has bought the rights to the brand. The financial details of the deal were undisclosed.Dolcis's former owner John Kinnaird was said to have been trying to buy back some of the chain, but last week changed tack and bought failing menswear chain Envy for just £1.Share or comment on this article:Dolcis collapse: jobs toll hits 700Some links in this article may be affiliate links.
