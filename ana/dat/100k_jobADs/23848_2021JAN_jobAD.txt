Google MapsBy George Avalos |PUBLISHED: January 11, 2021 at 12:42 p.m. | UPDATED: January 11, 2021 at 1:43 p.m.A tech firm, hotels, restaurants, and a big retailer are among the latest companies to detail their layoff plans to state officials, a grim reminder that economic woes during the coronavirus recession have yet to run their course.The latest round of planned and upcoming job cuts in the region indicate workers must brace for fresh bouts of unemployment, a tough blow that arrives on the heels of 10 months of coronavirus-linked business shutdowns.Among the layoff plans disclosed to the state Employment Development Department:— Ventana Big Sur, a famed hotel and resort, 115 jobs in Big Sur.— Carmel Valley Ranch, a hotel and resort, 151 jobs in Carmel.— Analog Devices, a semiconductor company, will eliminate 255 jobs in Milpitas.— Lucky Chances Casino laid off 489 workers in Colma.— California Grand Casino disclosed a decision to lay off 181 workers in the East Bay community of Pacheco.— Ventana Big Sur, a famed hotel and resort, 115 jobs in Big Sur.— Carmel Valley Ranch, a hotel and resort, 151 jobs in Carmel.— Il Fornaio America, a Corte Madera-based dining chain with 21 restaurants, is laying off 347 workers. The company didn’t specify which of its restaurant locations would be affected.— The Fish Market revealed plans for layoffs affecting 107 workers, including 54 in Santa Clara and 52 in Palo Alto.— King’s Seafood revealed the layoffs of 123 workers employed in its San Jose restaurant at Westfield Valley Fair.— Safari West, a private wildlife reserve near Santa Rosa, disclosed temporary layoffs affecting 73 workers.— Rosewood Sand Hill, a Menlo Park hotel and resort, decided to temporarily chop 51 jobs.In a number of instances, executives blamed coronavirus-linked problems for their employment cutbacks or facilities shutdowns.“The COVID-19 pandemic initially prompted numerous restrictions on travel and group meetings that resulted in a drop in our business,” Sean Carney, general manager of Ventana Big Sur, wrote in an official notice to the EDD. “As a business that caters to global travelers and hosts large events around the world, this pandemic impacts us immensely.”Ventana Big Sur stated that for a time during 2020, it appeared business would stabilize. The hotel, perched on hills a short distance from the Pacific Ocean in scenic Big Sur, suspended operations in March and re-started operations on July 19. Ventana Big Sur is one of the Hyatt hotel chain operations.Similarly, Carmel Valley Ranch, another hotel and resort in Monterey County that’s owned and operated by the Hyatt firm, was hopeful when it reopened in late June after shutting down in March.The Carmel resort, hotel, and golf complex discovered that it was apparent the economic effects of the deadly bug remained severe and wouldn’t soon relent.“While there were encouraging signs that our economy could begin to reopen in some areas, it has now become clear that the demand for travel, events, and hospitality services will take substantially longer to resume than previously anticipated,” Peter McMahon, managing director of Carmel Valley Ranch, stated in a WARN notice to the EDD.One employer, tech company Analog Devices, said its employment cutbacks weren’t related to the coronavirus but instead its industry situation. The first layoffs will begin by Feb. 19 and be complete by the end of October of this year, Analog Devices told the state labor agency.“Analog Devices maintains a facility in Milpitas located at 275 S. Hillview Drive,” James Chalmers, an Analog Devices executive, stated in a letter to the EDD. “Changing business needs require us to close this facility permanently.”Sign up for email newslettersSubscribeFollow UsFacebookTwitterInstagramRSSMost PopularMonterey County getting poised for next phase of vaccine distribution	The Latest: Fireworks light up sky to celebrate inauguration	Harvey Weinstein dies; survived 1993 kidnapping	Seaside couple sentenced in racially motivated assault at bowling alley	High school sports: PCAL suspends all league schedules	Hyatt Monterey invests in major renovation	Salinas man pleads no contest, gets 30-year sentence for multiple molestations	Monterey County Fair names new president, vice president	Tags:CoronavirusGeorge AvalosMore in PoliticsTime running out to extend California’s eviction moratorium	The Latest: Fireworks light up sky to celebrate inauguration	Biden takes the helm, appeals for unity to take on crises	Murder suspect who escaped from Monterey County Jail turns himself in	WeatherE-EditionSubscribeSign Up For NewslettersFacebookTwitterInstagramRSSAbout UsAdvertise With UsMediaNews Group AdvertisingAbout UsContact UsE-EditionBuy PhotosWork For UsAdvertising SectionsClassifiedsLocal GuideJobsFreelance JobsOpen House DirectoryLegal NoticesToday’s AdsSpecial SectionsSubscriber ServicesSubscribeCopyright ©2021 MediaNews Group, Inc.Privacy PolicyTerms of UseCookie PolicyArbitrationPowered by WordPress.com VIPDo Not Sell My InfoClose"
