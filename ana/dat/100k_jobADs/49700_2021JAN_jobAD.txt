I would use the word \"enthusiastic\" if it didn't sound embarrassingly naive.I'm not asking anyone to engage in nationality-bashing. I'm just curious to hear your opinion as to where, in your experience, you encountered the groups of students to whom you most enjoyed teaching EFL, and why. What about them made the job rewarding or pleasant (even if only relatively)?Back to topEFL EducatorJoined: 17 Jul 2013Posts: 988Location: Cape TownPosted: Mon Jun 26, 2017 2:50 am Post subject:Tajikistan.....Great and motivated students...salary is fantastic too!Back to topsigmoidJoined: 21 Jan 2003Posts: 1276Posted: Mon Aug 07, 2017 10:05 am Post subject:While I wouldn't exactly call them \"engaged and motivated\", I most enjoyed teaching at several universities in Bangkok, Thailand. Most aren't very punctual or studious, but they can put on a good show doing role plays and presentations. We often had a lot of fun with classroom and off-campus English for Tour Guides activities.The other countries I've taught are Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.Back to top1st Sgt WelshJoined: 13 Dec 2010Posts: 946Location: Bandar Seri Begawan, BruneiPosted: Tue Aug 08, 2017 2:26 am Post subject:Vietnam.Back to topjim_bravaJoined: 22 Mar 2010Posts: 55Posted: Tue Aug 08, 2017 11:19 am Post subject:Malaysia.Most of the students in the 16-18 bracket seemed to be involved with some kind of startup business and/or online marketing-based activity.They all seemed to be very well-versed in the globalized modern world - especially with regards to tech and social media - and were largely free the enforced conformity of the communist countries or the somewhat enforced regressive superstition of, say, Thailand.Edit: Just saw that the thread was about learning English specifically. To be honest, the answer may still be Malaysia. However, only if learning English won't distract them from becoming a tech whizzkid millionaire by the age of 25.Back to topvoyagerksaJoined: 29 Apr 2015Posts: 140Posted: Wed Aug 09, 2017 9:32 am Post subject:All countries have many students in private schools that are extremely motivated. In my mind the question is which countries have better schools. China and Thailand separate the classes, Dullard, Dysfunctional, Somewhere in between, and Good student classes. If you have a son or daughter that is a dullard you can pay more to have them in the Good student class, etc.Back to topDisplay posts from previous: All Posts1 Day7 Days2 Weeks1 Month3 Months6 Months1 Year Oldest FirstNewest FirstJob Discussion Forums Forum Index -> General Asia Forum All times are GMTPage 1 of 1Jump to: Select a forum Where to Begin----------------General DiscussionNewbie ForumCurrent Events ForumTechnology ForumOnline Teaching Forum Africa Forums----------------General Africa Forum Asia Forums----------------CambodiaChina (Job-related Posts Only)China (Off-Topic)Hong KongIndiaIndonesiaJapanMalaysiaPhilippinesSingaporeTaiwanThailandGeneral Asia ForumVietnam Caribbean Forums----------------General Caribbean Forum Europe Forums----------------Czech RepublicFranceGermanyGreeceItalyMacedonia and the BalkansPolandRomaniaRussia & C.I.S.SpainTurkeyUkraineUnited KingdomGeneral Europe Forum Latin America Forums----------------ArgentinaBrazilChileColombiaCosta RicaMexicoMexico (off-topic)PeruGeneral Latin America Forum The Middle East Forums----------------BahrainEgyptIsraelKuwaitOmanQatarSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesGeneral Middle East Forum North America Forums----------------General North America Forum Oceania----------------Australia/New ZealandYou cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forumThis page is maintained by the one and only Dave Sperling.Contact Dave's ESL CafeCopyright © 2018 Dave Sperling.
