These are the documents on the basis of which your candidacy will be considered. You will not be able to respond to a vacancy if you do not prepare them.A resume is a document that reflects the history of your career, professional skills, qualities, and education. In other words, it's your self-presentation.A strong document lists all your former employers in reverse chronological order, including your responsibilities and achievements. If you are a graduate or have less than 3 years of experience, you should focus on your education. You can clearly emphasize your qualifications by telling in more detail about academic accomplishments. At the same time, a resume should be short. Its goal is to reveal only your professional activity.A cover letter is a solid addition to your resume. This document tells more about vocational qualities and skills. In it, you can include information that you were not able to put in the resume.In the cover letter, you should also explain to the employer why you are submitting your candidacy. And this can tell a lot about your motivation and desire to work. In essence, the cover letter provides more details as to why you must be hired. No more than one page of text and a unique letter for each employer are two essential conditions for the preparation of a magnificent document.03ConclusionsFinding a job in Nigeria can be a real challenge.
