INTERFACE 2016 was a chance for small businesses west of London to connect with the UK’s most influential creative organisations.“We are incredibly grateful to Zealous for making our searching and selection process so simple and straightforward for both our designer and digital partners. Our INTERFACE event is all about discovering regional talent and the ability to narrow the search and highlight the most relevant past projects really streamlined the entire process. We look forward to working with both Zealous and our newly discovered partners again.”Ryo Tabusa – Globe Education Digital CoordinatorZealous sourced a graphic designer and 32 digital companies from Bath, Bristol, Oxford, Swindon, and the Greater Berkshire Area.
