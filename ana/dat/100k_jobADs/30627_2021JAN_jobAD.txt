Not only do you have to consider your health and whether you are physically well enough to go into an interview, but you also have to bear in mind the impact of pregnancy discrimination. Despite the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, many women have lost out on great jobs due to being pregnant during the interview.Legally, an employer may not pass you over for a job due to being pregnant. Discrimination still occurs, and you may build a case if you can show the employer gave off some red flags that indicated he or she may have held your pregnancy against you.“Are you pregnant?”It is illegal, and kind of rude, for an employer to ask if you are pregnant. You do not have to answer the question, and you certainly do not have to volunteer any information. Some employment professions may recommend disclosing your pregnancy to build trust with your prospective employer. However, the employer may not ask this question to build trust. He or she asks to determine whether you will need a lot of sick leave in the future shortly after the hiring process. It is your choice to disclose what you feel comfortable sharing at this time and place.“What are your family plans in the future?”A young woman may go into a job interview without being pregnant or even married. That may not stop some hiring managers from trying to pry into your personal life and see into the future. It is illegal for hiring managers to ask anything about your possible family life in the future. In the event you receive a question related to having children or having more kids, then you may respond along the lines of not being able to predict the future but still being invested in the company.FacebookTwitterLinkedInSearch for:CategoriesEmployee Privacy (3)Employment Discrimination (25)Family And Medical Leave (29)Firm News (415)Harassment (2)Pregnancy Discrimination (17)Sexual Harassment (2)Sexual Harassment (84)Wage And Hour Laws (60)Workplace Discrimination (105)Wrongful Termination (79)ArchivesJanuary 2021 (1)November 2020 (1)September 2020 (1)July 2020 (1)June 2020 (1)April 2020 (1)January 2020 (1)December 2019 (1)November 2019 (1)June 2019 (5)May 2019 (4)April 2019 (5)March 2019 (5)February 2019 (5)January 2019 (5)December 2018 (6)November 2018 (5)October 2018 (6)September 2018 (4)August 2018 (6)July 2018 (7)June 2018 (5)May 2018 (7)April 2018 (4)March 2018 (5)February 2018 (4)January 2018 (4)December 2017 (4)November 2017 (5)October 2017 (4)September 2017 (5)August 2017 (4)July 2017 (4)June 2017 (4)May 2017 (5)April 2017 (4)March 2017 (4)February 2017 (4)January 2017 (5)December 2016 (4)November 2016 (4)October 2016 (4)September 2016 (5)August 2016 (4)July 2016 (4)June 2016 (5)May 2016 (4)April 2016 (4)March 2016 (6)February 2016 (4)January 2016 (4)December 2015 (4)November 2015 (5)October 2015 (4)September 2015 (5)August 2015 (5)July 2015 (4)June 2015 (8)May 2015 (9)April 2015 (2)March 2015 (3)February 2015 (4)January 2015 (5)December 2014 (4)November 2014 (4)October 2014 (3)September 2014 (4)August 2014 (4)July 2014 (5)June 2014 (4)May 2014 (5)April 2014 (4)March 2014 (4)February 2014 (4)January 2014 (4)December 2013 (5)November 2013 (4)October 2013 (5)September 2013 (4)August 2013 (5)July 2013 (4)June 2013 (5)May 2013 (4)April 2013 (4)March 2013 (4)February 2013 (4)January 2013 (5)December 2012 (4)November 2012 (4)October 2012 (5)September 2012 (4)August 2012 (5)July 2012 (4)June 2012 (4)May 2012 (5)April 2012 (5)March 2012 (4)February 2012 (5)January 2012 (9)December 2011 (1)Recent PostsCost-cutting measures may amount to age discriminationShould workers discuss sexual harassment on social media?What to do if your boss is harassing youHow do you know if you have been wrongfully terminated?Accommodations available to pregnant woman while workingSubscribe To This Blog’s FeedHow Can We Help?Email Us For A ResponseFresno8050 North Palm Avenue, Suite 210Fresno, CA 93711~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid559-494-4911~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid559-421-0369Fresno Law Office MapSan Luis Obispo~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid805-328-6206~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid424-279-4991Sacramento770 L StreetSuite 950Sacramento, CA 95814~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid916-361-6048~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid916-361-6049Map & DirectionsOakland~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid510-901-0774~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid510-464-8073San Francisco~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid415-830-8941~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid415-946-4042Fresno8050 North Palm Avenue, Suite 210Fresno, CA 93711~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid559-494-4911~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid559-421-0369Map & DirectionsSan Luis Obispo~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid805-328-6206~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid424-279-4991Sacramento770 L StreetSuite 950Sacramento, CA 95814~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid916-361-6048~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid916-361-6049Map & DirectionsOakland~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid510-901-0774~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid510-464-8073San Francisco~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid415-830-8941~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid415-946-4042Fresno8050 North Palm Avenue, Suite 210Fresno, CA 93711~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid559-494-4911~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid559-421-0369Fresno Law Office MapSan Luis Obispo~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid805-328-6206~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid424-279-4991Sacramento770 L StreetSuite 950Sacramento, CA 95814~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid916-361-6048~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid916-361-6049Map & DirectionsOakland~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid510-901-0774~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid510-464-8073San Francisco~|icon_phone~|elegant-themes~|solid415-830-8941~|fax~|font-awesome~|solid415-946-4042FollowFollowFollowReview Us© 2021 Bryant Whitten, LLP.
