Set clear rules and boundaries from day one and stick to them.2. Write your rules where pupils can see them.3. Be consistent and always follow up on consequences.4. Understand your school’s discipline policies. You don’t want your pupils to know them better than you.5. Use a seating plan to help you remember names. Try telling pupils where to sit rather than letting them choose.6. Own the classroom. Don’t just sit or stand behind your desk. Walk around the room with confidence (fake it if you have to).7. Welcome pupils at the door to signal that they are entering your space.8. Have strategies for getting pupils to be quiet that don’t involve shouting. When you shout, tensions rise resulting in further bad behaviour.9. Be organised. It only takes a moment’s distraction for bad behaviour to emerge so keep all the equipment and materials you might need to hand.10. Make your lessons engaging. It sounds obvious but if your pupils are interested they won’t get chance to misbehave.11. Talk to the teacher who had your class last year so that you can learn about the different personalities in the group before teaching them for the first time.12. Predict bad behaviour before it happens. Are there particular times of day when pupils are more likely to misbehave? Anticipating problems means you can head off bad behaviour before it arises.Files in this ResourceFile nameTypeSize4 kB DownloadLeave a Reply Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment.Author GT JobsDate 21-06-2018SubjectsWorkplaces Further Education, Higher Education, Independent Pre-Prep, Independent Preparatory, Independent Senior, Nursery, Other Workplaces, PrimaryGTJobs brings talented new Teachers into your workplace to give your Students the most amazing education.CandidatesCandidate OverviewFind a JobHow it WorksRoutes into TeachingResourcesNQT Induction YearEmployersEmployers OverviewAbout usPost a JobContact UsPricingSign upJobsPrimarySecondaryFurther EducationHigher EducationSpecial EducationNurseryGTJobs Ltd is Registered in England.
