The company powers a smarter job search by pulling in data from across the internet, job matching sites and apps. XpressJobs.lk is now part of this global project to make recruitment an easier, simplified effort through Google Search.“We’re thrilled to be a startup that collaborates with Google and be among global companies such as LinkedIn and Monster!” said Chathum Henegama, Co-Founder and CEO of XpressJobs.lk. “Being among the top 100 websites Sri lankans visit, we already get over 35% of our traffic from Google Search. It’s a pretty big deal for us because now we have a much larger audience made up of the billions of Google users who can see our listings.”An accurate, refined search resultCandidates already use Google to search for jobs. Thanks to machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI), this search engine not only shows you relevant findings that match your keyword, but ranks them by distance to your location, learns about your job search preference, and provides additional filters. Cloud talent solutions integrated in Jobs Search automatically detect acronyms, understand industry jargon often used by employers in job listings and detect the desired seniority making sure that roles that are far too junior or senior are not incorrectly matched among other things. You don’t have to login to a particular job site to search for jobs because Google pulls in this data from its partner sites to deliver a refined search result, and a better overall user experience.Market trends in Sri LankaTouching on Sri Lanka’s job market, Dr. Oshadie Korale, Chief Operating Officer of XpressJobs.lk, said that the hardest part of recruitment is finding people to do a trade job. “We see a big shortage of skilled labour such as electricians and technicians but young people don’t want to do those, even though the pay is good. Everyone wants a desk job,” says Oshadie. An increasing trend in young people resorting to driving tuk tuks (three wheelers) poaches a valuable working force from other much needed jobs. Recruiters and employers are also frustrated to see graduates who are only paper qualified and do not have practical knowledge of the real world.XpressJobs.lk’s role in the Sri Lankan job marketAs a tech-based recruitment company, XpressJobs.lk researches on why there are gaps in the labour market and how to fill them. Some of their initiatives include a CV-less application system, filtering systems, SMS interview selection, video job advertisements. “Young people don’t read newspapers, so a traditional paper ad might not gain enough exposure. This is why we need other digital means of reaching out to them,” continues Oshadie.Modern advancements such as AI and machine learning stand to greatly benefit job seekers in Sri Lanka while global partnerships such as this strengthen recruitment and address important needs in the global job market.Previous PostJinasena launches Sri Lanka’s first-ever Nano Technology Water Purification Plant in PolonnaruwaNext PostUber all set to launch on-demand food delivery app, Uber Eats in Colombo this monthRelated NewsCDB Finance leads the Finance Sector Automation with John Keells ITpublisherJanuary 27, 2021 January 27, 2021Airtel becomes first Sri Lankan telco to integrate Google’s Business MessagespublisherJanuary 27, 2021 January 27, 2021Rakuten Viber’s robust growth in Sri Lanka contributes to impressive performance for APAC region in 2020publisherJanuary 27, 2021 January 27, 2021VIVO Y SERIES 2021 LINE-UP OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF INNOVATIVE CAMERA AND PERFORMANCE FEATURES FOR THE SRILANKAN YOUTHpublisherJanuary 25, 2021 January 25, 2021MOST VIEWED1	TrailSL draws to an endwith the support of SriLankan Airlines team membersadmin1.1K2Globally acclaimed ‘World’s first wildlife travel-based management lessons book’ by Wilfred Sarath Eranga Perera to be launched in Sri Lanka.publisher6553Classic Destinations, one of the First DMC to receive ‘Safe & Secure Certification’ from SLTDApublisher5194Emirates expands its operations in the Americas in line with increased passenger demandpublisher4715HEALTHCARE HEROES AT IDH RECOGNIZEDpublisher462ArchivesJanuary 2021 (183)December 2020 (210)November 2020 (188)October 2020 (222)September 2020 (238)August 2020 (194)July 2020 (212)June 2020 (182)May 2020 (141)April 2020 (131)March 2020 (180)February 2020 (210)January 2020 (186)December 2019 (180)November 2019 (185)October 2019 (232)September 2019 (173)August 2019 (197)July 2019 (169)June 2019 (96)May 2019 (186)April 2019 (94)March 2019 (178)February 2019 (163)January 2019 (169)December 2018 (180)November 2018 (190)October 2018 (179)September 2018 (179)August 2018 (217)July 2018 (229)June 2018 (135)May 2018 (187)April 2018 (150)March 2018 (210)February 2018 (195)January 2018 (195)December 2017 (191)November 2017 (253)October 2017 (265)September 2017 (219)August 2017 (293)July 2017 (133)June 2017 (192)May 2017 (225)April 2017 (147)March 2017 (277)February 2017 (97)January 2017 (103)December 2016 (114)November 2016 (214)October 2016 (241)September 2016 (152)August 2016 (133)July 2016 (207)June 2016 (201)May 2016 (210)April 2016 (184)March 2016 (143)February 2016 (130)January 2016 (188)December 2015 (193)November 2015 (226)October 2015 (257)September 2015 (238)August 2015 (187)July 2015 (196)June 2015 (175)May 2015 (186)April 2015 (135)March 2015 (181)February 2015 (158)January 2015 (104)Ceylon Business Reporter is the premier business reporting website in Sri Lanka.
