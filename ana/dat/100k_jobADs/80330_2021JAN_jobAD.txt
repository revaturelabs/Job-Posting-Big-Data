"Eeek! Falling down on the job ‚Äì Wise SassWise SassWise SassSkip to contentSearch for:Posted on November 27, 2010 August 27, 2011 by Wise Sass	Eeek! Falling down on the jobFor a beginning blogger I‚Äôm not doing a very good job, am I? I‚Äôve been woefully neglectful!In my defense, it was Thanksgiving week and we had company for 7 days, I was off work for 5 days, and we made a very quick 16 hour roundtrip drive/relatives-visit in there as well. But my family just left 30 minutes ago and the turkey & pumpkin pie are almost all gone so I guess it‚Äôs time to tune back in to reality.Before reality sets in, can I just muse on how absolutely wonderful it was to have my family with us this week? It was my mom & stepdad. My mom is wonderful. She‚Äôs SUCH a mom, and grandma. It‚Äôs her true calling. That and talking ‚Äì her nickname is Chatty Cathy because she can talk up anybody. Truly, it‚Äôs a gift. I am infinitely more reserved.When my mom visits, or I visit her, she takes care of ME. Who else does that? My husband . . . sometimes, but he‚Äôs busy. You know how it is. But my mom ‚Äì she worries about me, asks me what she can do to help, and generally just pitches in to make my life a little better during our time together. I‚Äôm so lucky to have her! And she‚Äôs such a good, supportive, loving grandma. She kisses, hugs, and spoils all of us. She & my stepdad are such gems and I‚Äôm one very lucky girl to have them. ‚ù§So I‚Äôm writing today with some sadness, after saying goodbye to them, and some worry since we‚Äôre having a snowstorm this morning and they had to leave in it. I hope they make it safely to their destination tonight; I‚Äôll be on pins and needles until I know they are safe.But I‚Äôm also feeling loved, safe and secure today too. They provide us with so much ‚Äì love, money, and just plain old always-here-for-you support. My family is full of problem-solvers and I love them for it! Generally when I call my mom to discuss an issue before I have even explained the problem she‚Äôs saying, ‚Äúwell, could you do this? or what about this?‚Äù So we‚Äôve spent the last week discussing, mulling, and agreeing on different things we can do to solve various problems and, really, that‚Äôs a gift in itself, right? Just someone to HELP. To talk to and say, ‚Äúwhat do you think?‚Äù *sigh* I love them.I have to put a halt to this missive for now; domestic goddess duties are calling. I have to take my boys to a wedding reception tonight and I‚Äôm making something gluten-free to bring with me. I‚Äôm off to find a gluten-free brownie recipe! Then maybe I‚Äôll blog about that too. üòâ I know I‚Äôm going to add cherries and coffee to it for sure. Stay tuned.Oh, and happy holidays!Share this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...RelatedPosted in gluten-freeTagged bloggers, gluten-free, Thanksgiving, women writing	Post navigationPrevious Article CathyNext Article Jane Austen ‚Äì a warningLeave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
