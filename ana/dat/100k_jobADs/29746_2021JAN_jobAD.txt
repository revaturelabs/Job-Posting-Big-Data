There are several thousand objects orbiting Earth that are large enough to be detected by radar, but there are far greater numbers of very small objects, such as flakes of paint. Calculate the force exerted by a 0.100-mg chip of paint that strikes a spacecraft window at a relative speed of 4 . 00 × 10 3 m/s size 12{4 \".\" \"00\" times \"10\" rSup { size 8{3} } \"m/s\"} {} , given the collision lasts 6 . 00 × 10 – 8 s .Professional ApplicationA 75.0-kg person is riding in a car moving at 20.0 m/s when the car runs into a bridge abutment. (a) Calculate the average force on the person if he is stopped by a padded dashboard that compresses an average of 1.00 cm. (b) Calculate the average force on the person if he is stopped by an air bag that compresses an average of 15.0 cm.(a) 1 . 50 × 10 6 N size 12{ - 1 \".\" \"50\" times \"10\" rSup { size 8{6} } N} {} away from the dashboard(b) 1 . 00 × 10 5 N size 12{ - 1 \".\" \"00\" times \"10\" rSup { size 8{5} } N} {} away from the dashboardProfessional ApplicationMilitary rifles have a mechanism for reducing the recoil forces of the gun on the person firing it. An internal part recoils over a relatively large distance and is stopped by damping mechanisms in the gun. The larger distance reduces the average force needed to stop the internal part. (a) Calculate the recoil velocity of a 1.00-kg plunger that directly interacts with a 0.0200-kg bullet fired at 600 m/s from the gun. (b) If this part is stopped over a distance of 20.0 cm, what average force is exerted upon it by the gun? (c) Compare this to the force exerted on the gun if the bullet is accelerated to its velocity in 10.0 ms (milliseconds).A cruise ship with a mass of 1 . 00 × 10 7 kg size 12{1 \".\" \"00\" times \"10\" rSup { size 8{7} } \" kg\"} {} strikes a pier at a speed of 0.750 m/s. It comes to rest 6.00 m later, damaging the ship, the pier, and the tugboat captain’s finances. Calculate the average force exerted on the pier using the concept of impulse. (Hint: First calculate the time it took to bring the ship to rest.)4 . 69 × 10 5 N size 12{4 \".\" \"69\" times \"10\" rSup { size 8{5} } \" N\"} {} in the boat’s original direction of motionCalculate the final speed of a 110-kg rugby player who is initially running at 8.00 m/s but collides head-on with a padded goalpost and experiences a backward force of 1 . 76 × 10 4 N size 12{1 \".\" \"76\" times \"10\" rSup { size 8{4} } \" N\"} {} for 5 . 50 × 10 –2 s size 12{5 \".\" \"50\" times \"10\" rSup { size 8{\"-2\"} } \" s\"} {} .Water from a fire hose is directed horizontally against a wall at a rate of 50.0 kg/s and a speed of 42.0 m/s. Calculate the magnitude of the force exerted on the wall, assuming the water’s horizontal momentum is reduced to zero.2 . 10 × 10 3 N size 12{2 \".\" \"10\" times \"10\" rSup { size 8{3} } `N} {} away from the wallA 0.450-kg hammer is moving horizontally at 7.00 m/s when it strikes a nail and comes to rest after driving the nail 1.00 cm into a board. (a) Calculate the duration of the impact. (b) What was the average force exerted on the nail?Starting with the definitions of momentum and kinetic energy, derive an equation for the kinetic energy of a particle expressed as a function of its momentum.p = m v ⇒ p 2 = m 2 v 2 ⇒ p 2 m = mv 2 ⇒ p 2 2 m = 1 2 mv 2 = KE KE = p 2 2 m alignl { stack { size 12{p=mv drarrow p rSup { size 8{2} } =m rSup { size 8{2} } v rSup { size 8{2} } drarrow { {p rSup { size 8{2} } } over {m} } =mv rSup { size 8{2} } } {} #drarrow { {p rSup { size 8{2} } } over {2m} } = { {1} over {2} } mv rSup { size 8{2} } = ital \"KE\" {} # {underline { ital \"KE\"= { {p rSup { size 8{2} } } over {2m} } }} {}} } {}A ball with an initial velocity of 10 m/s moves at an angle 60º above the + x size 12{+x} {} -direction. The ball hits a vertical wall and bounces off so that it is moving 60º above the − x size 12{ - x} {} -direction with the same speed. What is the impulse delivered by the wall?When serving a tennis ball, a player hits the ball when its velocity is zero (at the highest point of a vertical toss). The racquet exerts a force of 540 N on the ball for 5.00 ms, giving it a final velocity of 45.0 m/s. Using these data, find the mass of the ball.60.0 gA punter drops a ball from rest vertically 1 meter down onto his foot. The ball leaves the foot with a speed of 18 m/s at an angle 55º size 12{\"55\"°} {} above the horizontal. What is the impulse delivered by the foot (magnitude and direction)?Questions & Answerswhere we get a research paper on Nano chemistry....?Maira Replynanopartical of organic/inorganic / physical chemistry , pdf / thesis / reviewAliJoin the discussion...Replywhat are the products of Nano chemistry?Maira ReplyThere are lots of products of nano chemistry...
