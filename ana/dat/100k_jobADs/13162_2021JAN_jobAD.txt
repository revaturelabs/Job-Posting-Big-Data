Stallone was nominated for an Oscar last year (but lost to Mark Rylance, who isn’t American, so Trump won’t want him in his administration).Stallone released a statement turning the job offer down. He said it would be better for him to use his time for “bringing national attention to returning military personnel in an effort to find gainful employment, suitable housing and financial assistance these heroes respectfully deserve.” However, he said that he was “incredibly flattered to have been suggested to be involved.”Stallone just might be a RepublicanStallone might be right at home in Trump’s administration.

He has said recently that he wants to dedicate time to making films that shine a light on returning soldiers and bring attention to the challenge they face and they come back into civilisation, starting with his new film starring Adam Driver that he’s directing, “Tough As They Come.”Don’t think an action movie icon would be at home in the world of politics?We selected the best for you.
