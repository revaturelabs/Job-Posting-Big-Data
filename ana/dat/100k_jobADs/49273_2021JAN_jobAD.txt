This is because of the scales of economy, support umbrella, expertise and financial rewards it can offer.”Last month EweMove announced that it had welcomed its 125th franchisee - Damien Guest, who previously worked for Your Move. He was reported to be only the 44th EweMove franchisee with previous agency experience.Earlier this year EweMove boasted of having the industry’s shortest average sales time for vendors’ properties moving from new instruction to completion, and TPFG reported that in 2018 EweMove made a modest pre-tax profit of some £400,000; its sales completions grew by 22 per cent in 2018 last year and its lettings completions grew by 26 per cent.However, this week’s statement by the company is light on specifics, simply saying: “EweMove has seen good returns for the past two years despite the political uncertainty affecting the property market.”Tags:EweMoveNick NeillThe Property Franchise GroupFranchisesHybrid Estate AgenciesPreviousSubscribe to commentsShare this articleNextPreviousNextShare this articleSubscribe to comments×Share to FriendFriend NameFriend EmailMessageJoin the conversation Sign inBe the first to comment (please use the comment box below)Please login to comment×Thank you for your inputPlease confirm you wish to report this comment as abuse.We value your safety and feedback.
