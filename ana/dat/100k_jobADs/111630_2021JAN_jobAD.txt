In preparation for REDD+ implementation, and as an effort to mitigate ensuing impacts from REDD+ actions, the Cancun Agreements (Decision 1/CP. 16) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) call countries to address and respect a set of seven safeguards. One of these safeguards is (d) The full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, in particular indigenous peoples and local communities, in actions referred to in paragraphs 70 and 72 of this decision.Building on work undertaken by the UN-REDD Programme (2011 – 2015), UNDP, as Delivery Partner for the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) project supporting Office of Climate Change and Development in the implementation of the National Climate Compatible Development Management Policy, will contribute to the development of PNG’s capacity to design a sound national REDD+ strategy, develop and sustain national readiness management arrangements, elaborate REDD+ strategy options, develop the REDD+ implementation framework, assess social and environmental impacts, develop a Reference Level, and design a monitoring system.These objectives will be achieved through two outcomes:Outcome 1: Capacities exist for effective and efficient management of REDD+, including full and effective participation of all relevant stakeholders;Outcome 2: National REDD+ Strategy.One of the fundamental gaps identified during the consultation and participation process in PNG is the sustainability of the process at the community level. For example, often women within the country, given existing customary law and cultural barriers, have very limited rights over land and limited ability to control income and other resources, face other legal barriers, as well as face exclusion from decision-making and violence directed against them. The consultation and participation process can only be effective if there are mechanisms established at the national level and within the provinces to ensure its sustainability, wherein men, women and youth are equitably involved.As such, this assignment will develop gender responsive and inclusive consultative and participatory REDD+ mechanisms at the national and provincial levels. These mechanisms will inform the implementation of the draft national REDD+ policy, including the design of an implementation plan for demonstration activities in pilot sites. Both these areas will ultimately provide lessons during the drafting of the national REDD+ strategy. Additionally, this assignment will also review existing national REDD+ related guidelines such as among others, Free, Prior and Informed Consent, Social and Environmental Safeguards, Benefit Sharing Distribution Mechanism in the draft national REDD+ policy, to ensure gender is included. These outputs will help achieve the two outcomes of the project, and pave the way for the institutionalization of formal consultation and participation mechanisms for REDD+ implementation.The relevant Decision 1/CP. 16 related to safeguards is found in Annex 1.Devoirs et responsabilitésThe objective of this assignment is to ensure that gender responsive and inclusive consultative and participatory REDD+ mechanisms are in place, while gender aspects are clearly articulated and mainstreamed into the draft REDD+ Policy. In turn, this will assist the future design of a national REDD+ strategy that reflects both national priorities as well as concerns of key stakeholders, including men, women and youth at the provincial levels.The International REDD+ Participatory Approach Expert with participatory and gender related experience is expected to work closely with the National Gender Expert to complete the tasks under this assignment, in close coordination and consultation with government counterparts and the team of national and international UN-REDD and FCPF staff, who will liaise with UNDP Country Office, UNDP REDD+ regional and global advisors. The conceptual leadership of this assignment will be assumed by the International Consultant, including work plan preparation and methodological leadership.The International REDD+ Participatory Approach Expert will work closely with a National Gender Expert to prepare the necessary studies, concept notes, agendas and other materials in PNG and following-up on activities.The expert is expected to undertake the following activities in order to achieve the stated objectives above:Be responsible for the day to day management of the team, work plan and outputs to ensure quality control;Lead and finalise the review of the situational analysis: formal and informal rules and institutions, stakeholder mapping and analysis, capacity building needs analysis, and review of national REDD+ related guidelines;Lead and finalise the development of the gender responsive and inclusive consultative and participatory mechanisms for the national and provincial levels.CompétencesStrong experience providing strategic advice and dealing with the government and development partners;Strong research, analysis, report-writing, facilitation, communication and inter-personal skills;Ability to adapt and work in politically sensitive situations.Qualifications et expériences requisesEducationPhD or Masters in a relevant discipline, such as Anthropology, Political Science, Development Studies and Natural Resource Management.ExperienceAt least 10 years of relevant working experiences in the areas of natural resource management or social development: experience in participatory and gender responsive processes is an advantage;Experience working in Papua New Guinea or the Pacific Islands;Experience working in REDD+ or climate change is an added advantage;LanguageFluency in written and spoken English.How to ApplyQualified candidates are requested to apply by 19 August 2015 by sending their application packages to registry.pg@undp.org with the subject line “FCPF - International Consultant – REDD+ Participatory Approach Specialist\".The application should contain:Cover letter explaining why you are the most suitable candidate for the advertised position and a brief methodology on how you will approach and conduct the work (if applicable).
