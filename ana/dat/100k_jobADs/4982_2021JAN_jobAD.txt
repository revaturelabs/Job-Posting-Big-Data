(Pretty Sure You’ve Got It Wrong!)​Do you really get a high income driving with GRAB?There are currently two GRAB payout system; by hourly and by number of trips.Both present a high gross income or gross hourly rate!Source: GRAB - A System that Rewards You Every HourHow this system works is that, as long as you drive for a required minimum number of hours and completed a certain amount of trips, you'll be guaranteed a payout of a certain sum.This is illustrated in the chart above.Source: Grab - Earnings GuaranteeThe second system is pretty straightforward, as long as you completed a minimum number of trips, you'd be guaranteed a certain sum of payout.This though, is accompanied by long hours of driving.If you work as a part-time GRAB driver everyday (3 hrs/day). The estimated gross income is around $600/week.What if you work as a full-time GRAB driver with normal office hours shifts from Monday to Friday (8 hrs) Based on the Grab Income Calculator, your gross income is around $900-$1000/week.If you're a weekend part-time GRAB driver, driving 3 hours per day, you'll earn a gross income of $186.GRAB Driver pay rate: Estimated net rate of up to $15.32/hourMothership ran an article on a GRAB driver who went ALL out to clock possibly the maximum of what a driver can do.He earned $12,469.50 in 5 weeks! You may check hereSince he cleared most (if not all) of the incentives, we can estimate the maximum NET per hour rate.Let's put in some assumptionsIf his petrol, parking cost, ERP charges, occasional fines incurred, miscellaneous costs amounted to $2,000 and if car rental cost was $2,000, total net earning for the driver would be $8,469.50.He would also have to less $2,494 because Grab takes 20% as platform fees.Hence, the NET earnings in the 5 weeks could be $5,975 (without factoring income taxes)The featured driver clocked a RIDICULOUS total of 390hours in 5 weeks.Hence, at $5,975/390hr, the NET hourly rate would be around $15.32.This is not a very high amount.If you want to achieve this, you'd have to have a good driver rating, a low cancellation record, a high rate of accepting trips, and of course long hours of driving.Hence, the biggest misconception about being a Grab driver is probably the high earnings.​In my opinion, being a GRAB driver gives you flexibility, freedom and income in the short term.​It is ok if you are waiting for the new school term or a call-up for interview for a new job.But if you are a working adult looking for a part time job to improve your finances, driving with GRAB may not solve the situation fully.The net hourly rate is not that high.Working and developing to advance your full time career may be the better option.​GRAB driving on weekends vs weekend Relief taxi driver?You can try becoming a weekend relief taxi driver instead! It's not a commonly heard term but it literally means taking over a taxi driver's duties when the taxi driver is away.The daily rate of renting a Taxi for relief duties is around $30-$50, as it's negotiable.Renting a GRAB car is a bigger commitment with leases usually in months.However, do note that the minimum age to drive a licensed taxi is 30 years old. So if your age falls below 30, GRAB it is then.You can check out this forum that hires relief taxi relief drivers: http://www.cabby.com.sg/H/Hirer.htmWhat about doing Grabfood Rider on the weekends?Below is a table comparison of different Food Delivery companies for both weekdays and weekends:Source: Food Delivery Riders (2019) – How Much Can You Make as a GrabFood, Foodpanda or Deliveroo rider?Does delivery job suit you?Possibly yes if you are a student.For Deliveroo, most of them are under 30 years old, consisting of students, part-timers, and professional athletes.As for Foodpanda, most of its riders are students, and between 20 and 32 years old.Read more: Don’t Follow Passion In Work!

I know of a friend who has gotten into financial strain because he is on a 6month vehicle lease and was unable to work for 2 weeks due to a health reasons.For Grabfood delivering, bad weather also impacts income.PMD Grabfood riders who break rules to rush orders also are at risk of LTA fines.Lastly, accident risk cannot be understated.
