Want to make sure everything is sourced ethically and environmentally friendly? The first thing you need to do is start bringing up your big ideas. Once you get the ideas out in the surface you can tackle what needs to be done next.

Have each team come up with smaller ideas to help get to that big goal. Each department can come up with ideas on how to create a more sustainable environment in their profession. You can then have the groups come together to bounce off ideas on how to make it better.Re-evaluate and Add New IdeasAs time goes on, you make need to re-evaluate some of your ideas.
