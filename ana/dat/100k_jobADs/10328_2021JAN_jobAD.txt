Ideally the style that I’m going for is coutrypop and I would like something that sounds really acoustic. I’m an up in coming singer and songwriter, kinda like a mixture between Taylor Swift and Avril Lavigne, and I would love this song to fully launch myself!Additional info:I need live instrumentation added. I need someone to help with the entire song-making process - writing, arrangement, creating background music/beat, other instrumentation, mixing and mastering. I'm an independent artist not affiliated with a record label. I'm looking to hire a very experienced producer. I'd like you to also mix and master if possible. The lyrics and vocal melody are already written. I will be recording vocals on my own. . I don't have a hard deadline for this.Post a job similar to thisor sign up to reply to jobs like thiscloseRefer Vanessa to another SoundBetter proThe pro will know that you referred Vanessa, and may then refer clients to youWho would you like to refer?Send referralcloseWhat can we help you with?Tell us more about your project:Need help?
