Both Jobs and Wozniak signedthe lid using a felt tip, with the latter Apple cofounder signing itas \"Woz.\"The framed lid is bundled together with a fabric Macintosh banner thatwas likely used at the event and features a Clemont Mok design of acyclist carrying a Mac computer.Neudecker, a University of Pittsburgh professor who studied theeffects of technology in schools, had the Apple II signed at the 1984launch event, where he represented his institution.\"At the reception following, attended by the founders of Apple, hemade it a point to meet Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. In preparationfor this he carried the lid from the family Apple II Plus in hisbriefcase,\" Doyle explains in the lot description. \"When he met themhe had them sign the lid. It became a prized possession, and he hadit framed and hung it in his home office.\"Apple products and other memorabilia signed by Jobs typically fetchhigh prices at auction.

A floppy disk signed byJobs expected to sell for at least US$7,500 at auction in 2019.Items signed by both Jobs and Woz are even rarer, since the two hada \"falling-out\" after Jobs stepped down from Apple in 1985.<https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/13/apple-ii-lid-signed-by-steve-jobs-steve-wozniak-going-up-for-auction>Glaeken Trismegestus	2020-11-15 22:05:35 UTCPermalinkThe signed lid, a part of a \"Rare Books, Autographs & Maps\"collection at auction house Doyle, will start at a bid betweenUS$20,000 to US$30,2000.A little nail polish remover should clean the lid of that Steve Jobscreeps signature in no time.Your Name	2020-11-16 06:27:27 UTCPermalinkPost by Glaeken TrismegestusPost by Your NameThe signed lid, a part of a \"Rare Books, Autographs & Maps\"collection at auction house Doyle, will start at a bid betweenUS$20,000 to US$30,2000.A little nail polish remover should clean the lid of that Steve Jobscreeps signature in no time.Woz is the technical genius, but there would never have been an AppleII (or an Apple I for that matter) without Jobs' \"gift of the gab\"salesman patter and ability to see what people want.

Of course they arecalling it \"Diversity\"Two massive problems with this statement ...1. I don't even live in America, thankfully.2. There is no \"cheap labour\" that can replace me since:a. I'm self-employed.b. I already charge an hourly rate that is well beloweven the local government's \"minimum wage\" and thetime I invoice for is far below what I actuallywork. Anyone wanting to do it cheaper would behave to work for free.fadden	2020-11-17 20:00:55 UTCPermalinkAll,This is an international group for the discussion of the Apple II.
