Typically, it is the in-house loan processors that get laid off first, and as a result, mortgage brokers opt for a more cost-effective option: contract mortgage processing. We recognize this growing trend and offer a very affordable way for new as well as existing contract loan processors to successfully launch a work-from-home mortgage loan processing business. In an effort to reduce overhead, mortgage brokerage firms are seeking contract processing companies to outsource their loan processing. Taking part of our Work-at-Home Loan Processing Program enables a contract loan processor to capitalize on this growing trend and begin working from home. As a contract processor, you will process loans for both local and national mortgage brokerage firms. We simply provide you with all the tools and resources you need to launch your own business: website, agreements/forms, online pipeline report, and even new broker clients to sign up with. If you have a minimum of 3-5 years loan processing experience and can process all types of loans, including FHA/VA, Conventional, Construction and Sub-Prime, then we might be a good option for you to help build your own work-at-home contract processing company.Jan 23, 2021Full-timeAs interest rates continue to rise and the refinance boom comes to an end, mortgage brokers are left with no other choice but to downsize.

Our magazine is targeted at operators or concert halls, stadiums, arenas, convention centers, performing arts theatres and fairgrounds. We offer two products to our subscribers: a monthly magazine and a weekly e-mail newsletter. We are currently looking for writers for our e-newsletter. Articles typically run 600-800 words and pay $100 a piece. You will also be responsible for helping us find art for the piece, typically one or two photos, often provided by the source.

Having an understanding of business journalism is crucial. A background in trade journalism is a big-plus. We assign some stories, but we are looking for writers to pitch us ideas. We are looking for writers to cover the following areas: Regional Writers who can form some type of relationship with the major NFL, NBA and MLB facilities in their geographic area. Please also learn the regions major festivals and key concert promoters and industry figures. Regions can be as large as a section of the United States (i.e. Pacific Northwest, New England), or as small as a single state or metropolitan area (i.e. New Jersey, the Bay Area, Orlando). This area is wide-open. Marketing Writers who follow marketing trends of venues and ticketing companies. In this position, we will assign you a bulk of the stories. Talent Writers who have a good sense of writing business articles about touring acts and sports teams. These can be some of the most difficult articles to write because it is often hard to get comments from major acts, but also rewarding because of the clips one can accumulate. We are looking for resourceful writers. Food and Concessions: This position will be one of the easier to build because most of the concert/sports food operations in the U.S. are handled by about five to six large companies with responsive P.R. contacts. Also looking for stories about trends in dining and new alcohol products. If this position interests you, please send a resume and two writing samples to the email address listed above.

Mystery shopping is a term used to describe the assessment of customer service by professional shoppers posing as customers. Some companies have in-house programs, whereby the company hires its own mystery shoppers. Other firms hire outside companies like ours to provide this service. Mystery shopping is becoming more popular among chain stores because good customer service means higher, steadier sales. Happy customers will return more often and will spend more per shopping visit. Competition in the retail sector is increasing and becoming more aggressive. Companies are entering the market and providing more selection and better service in order to attract customers. Customer service is now being used to differentiate one retailer from another. An effective mystery shopping program improves customer service. Store staff and managers will respond to such a program by improving service levels for each customer when they know that such a program is in place. Managers can also monitor the companys own standards and policies as set out for the store workers.Jan 23, 2021Full-timeWe are an international mystery shopping company with over 20 years mystery shopping for store chains in the US and in Canada.
