The remaining 35.7 percent of respondents said they have no opinion.The Grand Unity Party (BBP) has also announced it will take part in the alliance with the AKP and the MHP.On the other side, Felicity Party (SP) leader Temel Karamollaoğlu has called on the other opposition parties to come together under an “alliance of principles,” a proposal that has been welcomed by the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) and the İYİ Party.With a constitutional amendment approved in a public referendum in April 2017, Turkey switched from a parliamentary system of governance to a presidential system.The job approval rating for CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu came out at 19,4 percent, while 68,8 percent did not approve of his performance. Among CHP supporters, Kılıçdaroğlu’s job approval rating was 56,4 percent.
