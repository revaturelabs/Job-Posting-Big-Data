The key words are \"temple recommend\" and \"ecclesiastical endorsement.\" In other words, an amateur church official not even affiliated with the university can take away your job simply by stating, for whatever reason, that you're not \"worthy.\" Oh yeah, that's another key word, probably the most powerful of all within Mormonism. Has this ever actually happened to a tenured and/or tenure-track faculty member? That's a surprisingly good question. I'm inclined to answer that most dismissals at BYU Provo are done by university admins rather than by amateur clergy. Now in the rest of CES (Church Educational System), which includes various seminaries and institutes outside of BYU Provo, it's an entirely different story. You'd better stay on the good side of your bishop, or even better become a bishop yourself, to avoid any career difficulties. Dismissal from BYU is seen as punishment enough in most cases. The actual excommunications by amateur clergy based on subjective inner revelations are usually reserved for those entirely outside of the reach of CES. A good example would be David Wright at Brandeis.Markup: a blockquote code em strong ul ol li.Sociology Job Market Rumors | Job Market | Conferences | Journal Submissions | Privacy | Contact | Night Mode"
