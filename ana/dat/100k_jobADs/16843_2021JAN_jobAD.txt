"Cookie's Corner: Job HuntingTuesday, December 28, 2010Job HuntingI am currently a full-time mom to my 2 kids but I plan to go back to work when they're both a little bit older. I am a Registered Nurse and looking for a job online sometimes help. I am browsing in one site and they required me to submit my medical resume. If you're also of health profession, you can visit their site and search for a right job they posted that fits you, too!Posted by Cookie at 6:17 AMLabels: Living, Nurse, WorkNo comments:Post a
