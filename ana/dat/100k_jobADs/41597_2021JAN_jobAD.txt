Stretch January 14, 2014 at 11:16 PMMine used to do that, until one day I did not cave in to his wily cat ways. I stood there staring at him silently for literally 10 minutes- as he purred and meowed and rubbed all over my legs- before he cracked and finished every last damn kibble. I'm the boss. Not the cat.
