Let’s say you’re all set to send the email. It may so happen, that the HR deletes the email without opening it, or there are chances they may take it casually, or chances are they might even consider you for some other opening.How is it then that you get your message across to them clearly?Emails are your first impression to the recruiter. The email has your elevator pitch in it and will showcase your enthusiasm for the job.Recruiters when they go through such emails, they check if--your skills are matching the job description and what your USP is. Hence it is crucial you get this email right. It should follow a systematic structure.Let’s see how to write an effective job application email.Email subjectThe subject line needs to be relevant as it is the first thing that is visible. Have a strict nomenclature to follow. Don’t write sentences or phrases. Add your job description mainly. Some examples of subject lines could be:Job Description_YourName_ApplicationJob Application_Job role_YourNameSalutationAlways use ‘Dear’ followed by either Mr//Ms. Last name, or Sir/Madam. If you don’t know who is at the other end, then add ‘Dear Manager’. It is incorrect to use someone’s first name as it is informal and you don’t have a rapport with them yet. Also, if you know its a female colleague, prefer using Ms. as you are not aware of her marital status.Email body & conclusionKeep it short and sweet and to-the-point. Keep a formal tone and keep it professional. Summarise your CV in about a few important points. Remember, this isn’t your CV. You cannot write in detail here. Give enough information for the recruiter to know what you’re specialising in and where your interests lie. Ask them to look into your CV for any further information. Keep the font simple (stick to the default font). Don’t use colours or font styles. Conclude the email with a salutation and remember to mention your full name with your contact number. This makes it easier for the employer to contact you whenever needed.AttachmentThis is the most important as this will have your CV and cover letter. Don’t forget to attach them at the end. Name your attachments properly with your full name and what it is. Mention that you’re attaching your resume and cover letter in the email body itself.Read it once thoroughly before hitting the send button. Proofread and make sure there are no spelling errors as it would spoil the recruiter’s impression about you. Make sure you have attached the documents and written the email subject. Cross-check the email address too.Here’s a sample email to refer to:Dear HR Manager,I am very much interested in applying for the Data scientist position you advertised on (job portal name) recently. My educational qualifications and internship experience match the required job specifications. I would appreciate it if I am given a chance to prove my value addition for this job role.Kindly find attached my resume and cover letter.
