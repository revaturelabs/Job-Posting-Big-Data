This analysis of the SOC was prepared for the Employment Training Administration and Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.Occupational information can assist individuals who have never had a job become employed, it can help those who have lost jobs become reemployed, and it can indicate how those who are employed can become more productive. These outcomes are vital to the public interest and have direct implications for the future structure of occupational classification systems.Societal interests in workforce outcomes are less polarized than they were in the 1930’s when work began on the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. It has become possible and desirable to gather information about workers and jobs that more specifically addresses outcomes for workers that are important to the public. These outcomes include:workforce entry and reentryreemploymentcareer ladderscompetency identificationoptimal job matchesworker empowermentnational comparability of workinternational comparability of workmanagement of changesocial mobilityresearch into the following areas:labor market dynamicsemployment projectionslink with social statisticshistorical understandingmedical researchThere is general compatibility among objectives in the preceding list of societal interests that are affected by the design of occupational classification systems. With several significant exceptions, it is feasible to provide the types of classification information needed to support analysis and programs related to these public interests.General Issues in ClassificationThe enterprise of classifying all activity in the wage economy into a system of occupations raises several fundamental questions. Some of the questions are common to all taxonomies, whether they be of stamps, insects or occupations. All classification systems need to specify the distinguishing features that will determine inclusion or exclusion into categories. All systems require decisions about how constituent parts are to be grouped into broader categories. All systems should take into account how they are to be used to sort and organize data collected in the future. In addition, the designers of a system that deals with patterns of behavior (such as occupations) rather than recognizable material objects (such as insects) need to define the basic unit of analysis.Consequently, we can distinguish four conceptually different tasks in designing an occupational classification system. They are:selecting variables by which to define, cluster and describe occupations;defining occupations;aggregating occupations into a system of nested hierarchies; anddesigning the database (designating the information to be indexed to the occupational categories).Principles and GoalsThe future SOC should be shaped to provide information that will help achieve high priority social goals for the workforce. Our recommendations for the future SOC cover issues of system structure, information content, and application. Particular attention is given to streamlining the occupational classification system; emphasizing skills, authority and work fields in choosing variables and classifying occupations; and making occupational and labor market information more compatible and widely used.Core RecommendationsStructure: Integrate the DOT and SOC into a single system in which the SOC provides occupational information, with additional and more detailed information provided at the DOT level.Content: Classify occupations on the basis of skills, authority, and work fields.Uses: Simplify the connection between occupational, labor market, social and demographic information by using the revised SOC unit group as the main occupational unit.Priority Rankings for Public InterestsMost Important:Helping individuals with barriers to employment obtain jobsHelping displaced workers become reemployedIdentifying essential competencies needed for employmentMaking optimal matches between jobs and workersVery Important:Identifying career advancement opportunities for workersHelping students and workers make good career choicesProviding current labor market informationMaking labor market projectionsIntegrating occupational data with other information about the work forceImportant:Historical, international and medical researchIntegrating Data from Multiple SourcesA potential strength of the SOC is its use in connecting the wealth of occupational information collected by job analysis with the employment statistics and demographic information collected through surveys and the Census. Interconnection of these data sources will have a synergistic effect in increasing the power and use of this information. For example, this data integration would provide “real time” information about the following kinds of issues:career transition pathsoutcomes for displaced workersjob stability in specific occupationsearnings patterns in specific occupationsworker attributes associated with obtaining employment in specific occupationsworker attributes associated with retaining employment in specific occupationsworker attributes associated with upward mobilitydemographic characteristics of workers in specific occupationsoccupational distribution of unemployed workers and ratios of employed to unemployed workers in each occupation.occupations in which job creation is occurringcritical skill shortages which constrain industry growthchanges in occupational composition of specific industriesinterrelationships between changes in occupational structure and changes in industry employment levels and skill requirementsA primary test of the usefulness of occupational information is its power to provide a plausible, grounded account of the actual experience of workers. Just as a job should connect an individual’s activities with a larger group of workers and their activities, and that in turn with the output of a product or service that is valued by a changing society, a useful description of that job should reflect significant characteristics of the worker, the activity, and processes of change. Important public interests rest on the capacity of the future SOC to help us understand an emerging, dynamic labor market.Chapter HeadingsExecutive SummaryPurposes for Occupational InformationContext; Labor Market TrendsClassification IssuesPriorities of Potential UsersJob-Worker Matching: Case Study of Machine TradesPrinciples and GoalsRecommendations for the Future SOCImplementationAppendixArea of Work: Economy, PeopleBack to Publication ListRelated Blog PostsThe kindness of strangers feeds us for a day, a job feeds us for lifeJanuary 11, 2021Workers’ motivation to support themselves through work and to obtain shelter with the income they earn is valuable both for them and for society.If wages don’t count why should votes?December 3, 2020The outgoing president tweeted, “We believe these people are thieves.See AllOur Projects‹Realization ProjectDeveloping New Categories for HomelessnessData Dive to Study HomelessnessTools for Prioritizing Homeless ServicesSouth LA Promise Zone researchHomeless Attributes and Service NeedsLAX-LAMP Community Based StudyGreenhouse Gas and Wage SustainabilityAntecedents of Chronic Homelessness10th Decile Project to House High Need HomelessMinimum Wage ResearchProjects in need of Funding›FacebookTwitterTweets by @EconomicRTEmail *Zip *FacebookTwitterYouTubeLinkedInDonate244 South San Pedro Street, Suite 506, Los Angeles, California 90012 • (213) 892-8104Site mapSite CreditsCopyright"
