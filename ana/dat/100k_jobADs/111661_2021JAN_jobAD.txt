You will use modelling and experimental approaches to identify conformational subpopulations in a complex reaction mixture and to correlate their lifetime with biological activity readouts. The goal is to characterize and enrich the more active species with an eventual view of solving their structure.Your profilePhD in the biophysics and/or structure of protein aggregationStrong interest in protein aggregation and its role in disease.A solid publication record with first-author research publication(s) in peer-reviewed international journalsStrong expertise in biophysical techniques such as light scattering, FTIR, rotor dyes…Experience with kinetic modellingPrevious experience with optical tweezers or AFM is a plusHighly motivated, enthusiastic, critical and creativeThe ability to work in a multidisciplinary team is a mustPrior experience with high content analysis is a plusWe offerA versatile and challenging jobA vibrant, world-class research environment operating at an international levelAccess to the resources of two host institutions VIB (http://www.vib.be/en/about-vib/organization/Pages/default.aspx) and KU Leuven, one of Europe’s leading research universities (https://www.kuleuven.be/english/why-choose-kuleuven.html)State of the art research facilitiesA dedicated training program to broaden your expertise and enhance your skillsetA competitive compensation package based on expertise and experienceFinancial support for at least 1 year.
