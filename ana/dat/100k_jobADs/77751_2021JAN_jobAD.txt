By the way who doesn't love short cuts, specially when you are over confident of yourself!! LIKE ME!! So this is a beautiful pic of everything that I spent money on and bought from the wet market in Singapore! To Lose Weight faster, Mind you this is definitely not the healthy way and results depends on each body type. Next day I made the delicious Cabbage soup for fast weight loss !! Mind you it is risky to loose weight fast & I took that risk & made the famous fast weight loss cabbage soup!!
