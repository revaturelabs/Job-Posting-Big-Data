Because of its significant role in the history of the American West, Telluride was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1964. The town’s colorful Victorian-era homes, clapboard storefronts and historic buildings now mix with boutiques, art galleries, gourmet restaurants and much more. Perched above Telluride at 9,500 feet, Mountain Village complements the historic mining town with European-style architecture, modern amenities, ski-in/ski-out hotels and sweeping views of the surrounding peaks.Telluride and Mountain Village are linked by a spectacular, 13-minute ride on a free gondola — the first and only free public transportation system of its kind in North America.Continually ranked the #1 Ski Resort in North America by readers of Condé Nast Traveler, Telluride Ski Resort boasts uncrowded slopes, no lift lines and exceptional terrain for all levels and abilities. Beginners can get an expert’s eye view from the top of the mountain while cruising down green groomers, intermediates carve up the middle of the mountain and advanced skiers enjoy some of the most renowned slopes in the country, along with a lift-served backcountry experience with hike-to terrain. When it’s time to take a break from carving turns, the destination also serves up everything from snowshoeing and Nordic skiing to sleigh rides and fat bike tours.JOB DESCRIPTIONGreeting Customers and checking out customer purchases in a friendly & efficient mannerAnswer questions & respond to complaints.Will learn how to operate the Cash Register, do store charges, take payments for merchandise, process returns & refunds, andWhen selling cigarettes, you are required to check ID’sBag groceriesMake Coffee & Juices, Serve Customers & provide exemplary Customer ServiceDATES OF EMPLOYEMENTSeasonal Position –11/23/2020 to April 1, 2021DUTIESGreeting & Checking out Customer Purchases in an efficient & Friendly Manner.
