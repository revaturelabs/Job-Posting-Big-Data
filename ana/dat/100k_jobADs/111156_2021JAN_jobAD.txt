This bizarre suggestion was justified on the basis that if Celtic and Rangers join another league, while leaving the rest of the leading clubs behind, their colt teams would continue to bring interest and revenue to the game.Mr Longmuir seems to have missed the fact that in the event any of the above comes to pass, the departure of Celtic and Newco-Rangers would then create an opportunity for colt clubs to be considered. Their inclusion now is unnecessary, especially when Newco could potentially enter administration next season, lose players, suffer the mandatory 25 point penalty and be relegated into the bottom division with their colt players, who presumably would also suffer administration-related penalties.Speculation that Mr Longmuir is taking care of current business until he is ready to move to Newco is becoming hard to ignore. Newco need to get themselves out of the bottom league first, though. The colts team idea is certain to be rejected, the question will not even reach the SPL or Celtic. The 12-12-10-10 idea favoured by Newco is looking an increasingly hard sell, with 12-12-18 more likely. Mr Longmuir better look after the interests of all his member clubs if he wants to hang on long enough to move straight to Newco. If he loses his ability to be a dealmaker I’m not sure what he can offer an aspiring £100m company.Football is seldom played on a higher plane than we witnessed from the Camp Nou last night. Barcelona, until recently undisputedly regarded as the best team in the world, were up against it. With a league win assured their form stuttered and they had to become the first team in Champions League history to overcome a 2-0 first leg defeat.They delivered, as did their most precocious talent, but there was a hugely important lesson to be learned from the game.Milan are out of Europe because they made preventable mistakes which Celtic didn’t make, home or away, against Barcelona. Even at this level, the team which makes fewest preventable mistakes progresses.Milan and, after Juventus, Celtic, can spend the remainder of the season pondering the value of putting laces through the ball. Barcelona, of course, are fabulous, but the question remains, can they do it at home against Annan Athletic? I’m not so sure.[calameo code=000390171160c3bf6ac7a lang=en page=119 hidelinks=1 width=100% height=500]Click Here for Comments >Share.

Doncaster did say this, in his lawyery lawyer’s way, avoiding answering the question (‘Are Sevco Rangers?’).Sevco were an existing club when he said that (July 18, 2012). They were a club that existed, although they had not yet played a competitive match. So were Rangers. Rangers ceased to be a club on August 3, according to Nimmo-Smith. So they both were in existence when Doncaster said that.At what point is the existence of Sevco meant to have to have turned into the existence of Rangers, or vice-versa? When did that happen? How did that happen?Answer: it never happened.And if we are all getting caught up in things Neil Doncaster has said, here is a wee reminder from the CEO’s blog spot on the SPL website.http://www.scotprem.com/content/default.asp?page=s109“Any club that is spending more on players than they can afford, is automatically gaining a sporting advantage over every other club it competes with. To turn a blind eye, to allow clubs to continually fail to make prompt payments as they fall due, would be to allow those clubs to gain an unfair sporting advantage over all those other clubs that pay their players, the taxman and other clubs on time.”Black and white. Not lawyer’s non-speak.How come Sevco care about the first thing Neil Doncaster said (to the extent that they attribute to it a meaning it doesn’t have, although to be fair to them, Doncaster was clearly avoiding the question), but not the second thing?When Doncaster next opens his mouth about financial fair play and Lord Nimmo Smith and all that malarkey, can someone please remind him that he said this and ask him when a sporting advantage is not a sporting advantage?The Battered Bunnet on 13th March 2013 1:01 pmPhilvisyou’re getting confused between the youngsters and the senior team.sannabhoy on 13th March 2013 1:03 pmTTTT ,Thanks for the details.

Also with no challenge in sight from the worst tribute act ever seen, for the next four years anyway. Would you be at all surprised if the top league in Scotland was completely re formatted and renamed so that der Hun could cling to some belief that Celtic had not in fact just won 10 in a row.leftclicktic on 13th March 2013 1:10 pmPhil MacGiollaBhain‏@Pmacgiollabhain@stephenoneill5 @MaleysBhoys The hacks could start by asking Charlie about the Blackthorn deal.

To that end a report has gone to the FIFA Whistleblower web site from TSFM querying the impact of the LNS decsion on registration and eligibility rules and the SFA’s role in putting up the interpretation under query as it removes any real deterrent aspect i.e that what is won by not revealing all will be taken away and in so removing this meaning undermines the very integrity the rule is intended to uphold.Details of the report and background to it are athttp://scottishfootballmonitor.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/fair-play-at-fifa/comment-page-1/#commentsand I’d suggest anyone interested in the proper governance of Scottish football based on reality rather than myth perpetuation has a gander (and writes to FIFA themselves if they are so moved)blantyretim on 13th March 2013 1:15 pmGod bless Matt Kane, a lovely man indeed….blantyretim on 13th March 2013 1:16 pmI can also confirm that the Hugh Reynolds golf day is a superb day….and nightJJP-ON on 13th March 2013 1:18 pmCeltic_First13:01 on13 March, 2013Point well made sir. I was just thinking this very morning that we have had no clarification that if/when Sevco win Div3 that it is indeed their 1st league title. As we near the inevitable, I have no doubt it will be claimed as their NEXT league title by an Ibrox compliant MSM (and of course the Sevconians), and not their 1st as a Newco. It will be a case of “move along Timmy nothing to see here” as usual. I think this needs to be brought out into the open, discussed and dealt with now. Or have I missed this discussion already?Celtic_First on 13th March 2013 1:18 pmAuldheidGood stuff.

I’d guess Sevco’s wage offer will be upwards of £150k a year for him to go to all this hassle.Chuckles Le Vert could certainly do with a £100m annual turnover to cover the wages of the freeloaders he’ll have on board. £250k for Traynor!A third division team losing £1m a month who were beaten by Annan Athletic at home a few days ago talking about entering a “colt” team to the senior set up.
