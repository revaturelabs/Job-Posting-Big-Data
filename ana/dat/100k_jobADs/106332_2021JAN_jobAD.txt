I would suggest you ensure that your answers are clear and concise, especially technical answers. For example, solving a hard drive problem, I was looking for basic step by step troubleshooting, which would be similar to a technical documentation format.Also, just some advice on your resume and cover letter. Your cover letter had a number of typos and incomplete sentences. Your cover letter should be customized for the organization your applying to, and provide support for your candidacy. I would also suggest you reduce the length of your resume to either 1 or 2 pages at most.Take care,xxxxxNow first of all, I do appreciate an employer giving feedback like this. They could have just ignored my request. However, I am confused about something. He said that my cover letter had a number of typos and incomplete sentences. Then he immediately proceeds to fail in the use of your vs. you're. I briefly thought about e-mailing him back to point out the irony of this, but I decided against it. Burnt bridges and all of that.Here is my cover letter for reference..May 4, 2012I am interested in applying for the position of XX XXXXX. I found this position Career Central and am writing for your consideration.With a background in applied science, IT, and technology solutions, I'm confident that my skill set matches what you're looking for. I'm a proud member of the Western community, a lifelong learner and someone who is heavily invested in my community.I would love an opportunity to work as part of this project. I'd like to thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon.Regards,XXXX XXXXXXNow, after poring over this, I will say that I missed the conjunction between \"position\" and \"Career\" and use of the word \"community\" twice does read a bit awkwardly. However, this is not the same as 'a number of typos and incomplete sentences.' In fact, I can't find a single typo. Can someone help clarify what he meant here?Also, I highly doubt the candidate had a stronger technical background. If you saw my resume, you'd understand that I am already quite overqualified for this position (which pays $16hr. I've been paid more for a more senior role in a bigger company).. So, my hunch is that they hired a 2nd or 3rd year engineering student with retail experience, and pretty much lied to me. There's no way for me to confirm this however.Finally, unless you want the font decreased so you can read it with a magnifying glass, there's no way I'm putting my resume down to 2 pages. I'd only be selling myself short and not painting the full picture. I have two pages for my education, work experience and certifications, and one page for my technical profile and volunteer experience with a couple lines dedicated to hobbies. I don't know how to cut this down without omitting things that I feel are important.You might think that a 3-page resume must contain fluff, but I assure you, I don't even have an objective statement. It's all business.In a perfect system, corporations would fear the government and the government would fear the people. - David WongCheck out caRpetbomBer's picks in this thread.Share:ReplyReply with quote221 repliesMay 29th, 2012 12:06 pm#2damnosDeal AddictJun 29, 20092307 posts211 upvotesTorontoMay 29th, 2012 12:06 pmA Syne thread about applying for jobs ... but I'll bite the bullet and reply anywayit's very nice of him to reply with more than 1 liner. Take his feedback and see what you can improve, it's not important whether he lied (that someone is more qualified, it doesn't matter whether it's true or not), or he has typos on his own (in fact your typo is a lot worse than mixing your and you're)And:Syne wrote: ↑ In fact, I can't find a single typo. Can someone help clarify what he meant here?Really? You are pretty bad at proof reading your resume/cover letter. I won't be surprised if you have a lot more errors in your resume, and such errors are reflection that you are not careful in what you are doing, typos in resume is a very bad reflection on you.Syne wrote: ↑ May 4, 2012I am interested in applying for the position of XX XXXXX.

I don't know how to cut this down without omitting things that I feel are important.Resume more than 2 pages is a lot of bs ... unless of course you are as accomplished as Alan Turing, Stephen Hawking, etc in their career and has publications and stuff.What you feel important is very likely a lot of fluff and of no relevance to what the employer is looking for. 2 Pages resume is 99% of the time the maximum and if you cant cut it down, that comes to your inability to write in clear and concise manner - likely the interview has the same experience with you and hence said you need to \"ensure that your answers are clear and concise\"+4ReplyReply with quoteMay 29th, 2012 12:06 pm#3SylvestreDeal AddictSep 30, 20033908 posts123 upvotesTorontoMay 29th, 2012 12:06 pm[QUOTE]May 4, 2012I am interested in applying for the position of XX XXXXX.

I've corrected it for accuracy. Sorry about that.I would have copy/pasted but it was in a PDF format.Sorry damnos, I know that most of your post was spent focusing on a type-o that actually wasn't in the cover letter.

It calls into question whether you can provide the client an efficient solution, or whether you're just going to create a proverbial \"Tower of Babel\" in terms of getting the job done.We have no way of evaluating the in-person interview claims. That's entirely subjective.As for your cover letter, 'would', 'could' tend to be conditional statements (prepositions??) in the English language. My suggestion is to avoid using them.my hunch is that they hired a 2nd or 3rd year engineering student with retail experienceMost likely; as I've discovered, employers really don't like to hire overqualified individuals.TodayHello wrote: ↑ ...The Banks are smarter than you - they have floors full of people whose job it is to read Mark77 posts...ReplyReply with quoteMay 29th, 2012 12:32 pm#10bruizemanDeal AddictAug 17, 20081180 posts113 upvotesMay 29th, 2012 12:32 pmLooks like that employer made the right decision.+6ReplyReply with quoteMay 29th, 2012 12:33 pm#11eiad77Deal AddictNov 15, 20101882 posts466 upvotesMay 29th, 2012 12:33 pmI have always wondered why Syne was so bitter in the career forum. After reading this thread, I have a much better idea why Syne has so many problems on the job market.1) You are clearly arrogant. Why would you think that the employer (who took the time to give you feedback) would lie about the reasons he didn't hire you? You really can't imagine someone has more technical knowledge than you?2) You can't take constructive criticism. As mentioned by the employer and also by a poster above, you don't need a resume longer than two pages. You don't have to list ever single job and every single certification you have. Tailor your resume to each job that you are applying to and only include what is relevant.3) Your cover letter is mediocre. It's one of the shortest I have ever seen. It's almost as though you wrote it just so you could say you have one. It is incredibly generic. You need to give more details about why you think you would fit. Why do you want to work as part of the project? Why are you confident that your skill set matched what they are looking for? You also need to write more formally and correct your grammatical mistakes.+5ReplyReply with quoteMay 29th, 2012 12:34 pm#12TonberryDeal AddictApr 19, 20082150 posts314 upvotesMontrealMay 29th, 2012 12:34 pmAt least you have some constructive feedback, mine was for 8 months:\"Thank you for your interest in working for XXXXX and for taking the time to submit your application through our website.We will now give careful consideration to your application, reviewing your details against the position criteria.

Perhaps if you cut down on the length of the Resume and put some of those extra words to the cover letter you would be in a better position. And a resume more than 2 pages (heck even over a nice page) contains BS and fluff. Or you have had many jobs that span just a couple of months or something like that, which looks really bad.As others said, no way to know what went on in the interview or how to judge it.+1ReplyReply with quoteMay 29th, 2012 12:53 pm#15eiad77Deal AddictNov 15, 20101882 posts466 upvotesMay 29th, 2012 12:53 pmZelig wrote: ↑ This isn't really the case, wiki has a blurb about it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Eng ... ions#UsageProblem being that \"correct\" usage of language isn't really relevant to job applications, only the appearance of correctness is.I don't think it's about being correct or not; it's about being formal.ReplyReply with quoteMay 29th, 2012 12:55 pm#16tsatDeal AddictMay 9, 20072270 posts99 upvotesTorontoMay 29th, 2012 12:55 pmSyne wrote: ↑ Also, I highly doubt the candidate had a stronger technical background.

It's all business.It's up to you whether to believe the employers feedback or not but a 3 page resume is nonsense and his advice to condense it should be heeded. I know you think it's great that you've been in school for a million years but a prospective employer doesn't care. If you have work experience than nix the volunteer stuff unless it's very closely related to the job you're applying for, because again... They don't care.You really put hobbies on your resume? Are you applying at an arts and crafts store?Your resume some how did its job and got you an interview. But the employer feedback is a little contradicting because why would you have gotten an interview in the first place?My hunch is that they just didn't like you as a person which I know is just ridiculous right?also:May 4, 2012I am interested in applying for the position of XX XXXXX.

This means when you go for an interview, you have to make a decision .... Does the person doing the interviewing want someone who talks a big game or do they want someone whose work speaks for itself? A fair way in deciding which way to go is to figure out whether or not the person should know your job or is an HR person.Someone who knows the job probably wants someone who can do the work and let the results talk, while an HR person may be swayed by a big talker.In the end though, the person interviewing you didn't like your attitude towards the job .... this likely came out during the interviewed and we can see it through the following:\"If you saw my resume, you'd understand that I am already quite overqualified for this position (which pays $16hr.

It reads more like the introductory e-mail that you attach your resume and cover letter to instead of just being a cover letter.ReplyReply with quoteDisplay posts from previous: All postsLast dayLast 7 daysLast 2 weeksLast monthLast 3 months6 MonthsLast yearSort by AuthorPost time AscendingDescendingGoReply to ThreadBack to topPage 1 of 12Jump to page: / 1212311Next LastTopJump to Forum Deals & Freebies Hot Deals Ongoing Deal Discussion Shopping Discussion 2020 Air Miles Shop the Block Coupons Freebies Request-A-Deal Contests Expired Offers Expired Hot Deals Expired Coupons Expired Freebies Expired Contests RedFlagDeals.com Buy, Sell, and Trading Post Buy, Sell, and Trading Post BST: Apparel BST: Automotive & Accessories BST: Cameras & Accessories BST: Cell Phones & Accessories BST: Computer Hardware, Tablets, Software & Accessories BST: Electronics BST: Gift Cards BST: Textbooks BST: Tickets BST: Video Games, Music & Movies BST: Everything Else Free Stuff Scammers and Warnings Archived BST Posts Site Related The Welcome to RedFlagDeals.com Forum Site Comments & Suggestions Discussion Art and Photography Automotive Wheels and Tires Careers Computers & Electronics Cell Phones Entertainment PC & Video Games Entrepreneurship & Small Business Fashion & Beauty Food & Drink Health & Wellness Home & Garden Green / Eco-Friendly Real Estate Parenting & Family Personal Finance Investing Real Estate Credit Cards Pets Students Sports & Recreation Fitness and Nutrition Travel Off Topic Archives Past Promotions Archive Black Friday, Cyber Monday & Boxing Day Forum Archive Boxing Day Discussion Archive Black Friday & Cyber Monday Discussion Archive Boxing Day 2017 Deals Boxing Day 2017 Discussion Black Friday & Cyber Monday Deals 2018 Black Friday & Cyber Monday Discussion 2018 Boxing Day 2018 Deals Boxing Day 2018 Discussion Black Friday & Cyber Monday Deals 2019 Black Friday & Cyber Monday Deals 2020 Black Friday & Cyber Monday Discussion 2020 Boxing Day 2020 Deals Boxing Day 2020 Discussion 2019 Air Miles Mega Miles 2019 Air Miles Shop The Block 2020 Air Miles Mega Miles Referral Deal Discussion Cyber Monday Deals 2015 Group Deal Discussion Past Promotions RFD 3rd Anniversary: Win an Xbox!
