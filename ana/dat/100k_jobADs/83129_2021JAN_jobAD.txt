Working in over 50 countries, PEPFAR has saved and improved millions of lives, prevented millions of HIV infections, and changed the course of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. PEPFAR is driven by a shared responsibility among donor and partner nations and others to make smart investments to save lives. Thanks in large part to U.S. leadership, tremendous progress has been made in the fight against global AIDS.Now in Phase Three: Focusing on Sustainable Control of the Epidemic, PEPFAR is focused on the ambitious Joint UN Programs for HIV/AIDS 90-90-90 global goals: 90 percent of people living with HIV know their status, 90 percent of people who know their status are accessing treatment, and 90 percent of people on treatment have suppressed viral loads by 2020. While the USG’s Strategy for Accelerating HIV/AIDS Epidemic Control (2017 – 2020) focuses primarily on 13 high-burdened countries, PEPFAR aims to support all countries with PEPFAR funding to reach epidemic control by targeting evidenced based interventions for populations at greatest risk of HIV in areas of greatest HIV incidence. PEPFAR's program builds on past strengths and increases efficiencies by scaling up effective interventions and ensuring value.PEPFAR Regionalization Approach – West AfricaPEPFAR has undertaken a major shift in West Africa. Starting in FY 2020, a Regional Operational Plan (ROP), which includes activities for Ghana, Togo, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, has been developed.. Coordination of the development of the annual ROP process will be managed largely from Accra by the West Africa Regional PEPFAR Coordinator.The purpose of PEPFAR Regionalization is to consolidate management and staffing; increase coordination and technical support and harmonize programming to focus on Key Populations (KPs) - Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Female Sex Workers (FSW) - who bear most of the HIV burden in this region.In West Africa, HIV data availability is improving but still remains fairly limited despite being a region that covers 15 countries and over 350 million people. In 2017, over 4.1 million people were living with HIV, representing 13 percent of the global burden. In the countries under PEPFAR’s West Africa Regionalization approach (Ghana, Togo, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Liberia), HIV prevalence in the general population range from 0.4 percent (Senegal) to 2.1 percent (Togo) while according to recent Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance Surveys, prevalence among MSMs range from 1.9 percent (Burkina Faso) to 27.4 percent (Senegal).For FSWs prevalence ranges from 5.4 percent (Burkina Faso) to 24.1 percent (Mali). Limited data exists in the region for transgender persons and people who inject drugs.In addition to challenges with data in West Africa, the other common challenges include significant stigma and discrimination, poor access to HIV services and poor quality of care among others.Given PEPFAR’s mandate to leave no population of greatest risk behind, programs under the West Africa Regionalization approach will work with host country governments and other partners to accelerate progress to epidemic control by focusing their limited resources toward KP and PLHIV programming – increasing case finding in these population groups, linking them to treatment and ensuring viral load suppression.2.
