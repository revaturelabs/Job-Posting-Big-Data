Brady went from working with the New Orleans Saints as an offensive assistant for two seasons in 2017 and 2018 to offensive coordinator at LSU in 2019, where he oversaw one of the best offensives in college football history.Brady then had his choice of jobs last offseason, including the Eagles’ offensive coordinator job, but elected to go to Carolina where he was able to call the plays. Although the Panthers’ offensive production was not great — 24th in points, 21st in yards — many feel that was due to a lack of talent as opposed to poor coaching.Brady checks off all the boxes the Eagles will be looking for — bright offensive mind, exciting new hire, thought of highly around the league and yet likely not powerful enough to ask for complete control over his staff/personnel just yet.The Eagles making the move to bring in Brady now would certainly be a high-risk, high-reward decision.The risk is clear — Brady is only 31-years old and has only spent three total seasons working in the NFL. Of those three, only one was in an important role. Brady might be viewed as having a bright offensive mind, but being a head coach is about much more than offensive schemes — although they are important. It is fair to wonder how Brady will do managing a staff that will likely be filled with coaches older than he is, with more experience, and a locker room that could also have players older than him as well.The Eagles found out quickly with Chip Kelly that if a head coach isn’t popular in the locker room it won’t matter how bright of a football mind he is. Brady might be able to do it, but having him manage the entire coaching staff and roster would be the main concern.The reward, however, could be huge.LATEST in sportsNick Sirianni and Howie Roseman can be winning team for EaglesWhy Eagles’ hire of Nick Sirianni may not be what it seemsRanking the 10 worst contracts in the NBA right nowWoodhead: 'Nick Sirianni a younger Frank Reich'3 things to know about Eagles head coach Nick SirianniTRENDING on RADIO.COMnewsCould the Patriot Party become a reality?musicThe Reel Buzz: Michelle Pfeiffer to play Betty Ford in new Showtime series 'First Lady'newsFirst Black Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, confirmedsportsRADIO.COM Sports NFL Championship Round expert pickssportsMLB players, writers mourn the loss of all-time great Hank Aaron on social mediasportsNFL Championship Sunday best bets: Back the underdog Bucs in Green Bay×96.5 TDY | 96.5 TDYListen to 96.5 TDY Contact Us EEO Public Inspection File Contest Rules FCC Applications Advertise with Us© 2021 ENTERCOM COMMUNICATIONS CORP.
