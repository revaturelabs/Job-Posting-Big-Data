The role of the admission/enrollment director has now expanded to include the marketing, admission, retention, and community development of the institution. As schools strive to move from simply being models of diversity to institutions that are equitable and inclusive, it is the responsibility of the admission/enrollment director to lead the charge as a vocal and creative partner within his/her institution, ensuring students and families are welcomed, engaged, and supported. This presentation provides useful and innovative information and resources for working towards transforming your institution into an inclusive community.Previous Presentation(Un)Privileged: The Cost of Being Poor at an Elite InstitutionDana Anselmi, Senior Associate Director of Admission & Director of Financial Aid, Berkshire School, MA, Hei...Next PresentationAttracting and Retaining Hispanic Students in Independent SchoolsMarjorie Mitchell, Director of Admissions and Enrollment Services, The Westminster Schools, GA Daniel Searl...Other content in this Stream‹›The Next Normal: How K–12 Independent Schools Can Survive and Thrive in a New Landscape (Executive Summary)<?xml encoding=\"UTF-8\">As schools continue to face the many challenges brought on by COVID-19, everyone is doing exceptional work finding new and creative ways to innovate their programs, tools, communications, and so muchView Resource48:15Dial Up Your Digital Marketing: Brand Identity RoundtableWatch Video55:44Dial Up Your Digital Marketing Part 2_ Discover and Tell Your Unique StoryWatch VideoThe Double Edged Sword of Diversity [Ep.41]<?xml encoding=\"UTF-8\">Dr. Derrick Gay is an internationally recognized consultant to businesses, educational, arts, and philanthropic organizations around the world regarding issues of diversity and inclusion.Read ArticleLet's start a satellite campus!
