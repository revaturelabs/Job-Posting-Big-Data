Of this, about $130-$170 billion a year is needed for infrastructure.”The bank is working with other stakeholders to ensure that the forum becomes the continent’s key springboard for investment to meet the massive infrastructure and development needs.Similar to the first edition, the 2019 forum will bring together project sponsors, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, private investors, policymakers, private equity firms, and heads of government to advance Africa’s economic transformation agenda, the organisers said.The inaugural event in 2018 featured some 63 projects from across 24 countries and seven sectors valued at $46.9 billion.African Development Bank president Akinwumi Adesina said: “We want investments in Africa to land on a smooth investment runway. No bumps.The forum has positioned itself as an honest broker between governments and private sector stakeholders including project sponsors, investors and transaction facilitators.”Preparations for the 2019 edition are well underway. Roadshows have been held across the continent and further roadshows are scheduled for investors in North America, Europe and the Middle East.For more about the forum visit https://africainvestmentforum.com/Inner City Gazette TVSithembile MoyoContact UsEditor: Sithembile MoyoEmail: editor@inner-city-gazette.comCell: 072 824 3014Contact FormYour Name (required)Your Email (required)SubjectYour MessageSithembile MoyoAbout UsThe inner-city Gazette The inner-city Gazette is a Unique Community Newspaper .Most Newspapers are owned by millionaires and reflects the outlook of the rich and powerful.
