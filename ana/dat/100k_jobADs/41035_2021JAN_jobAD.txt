The province has seen job numbers climb 1.5 per cent over the last year.Alberta shed 12,800 positions last month – 13,600 of which were full-time jobs. On a year-over-year basis, employment in the hard-hit province fell 1.3 per cent overall, while full-time work slid 3.9 per cent.British Columbia lost 600 positions last month, but compared to a year earlier it still led all provinces with the fastest growth rate of 2.1 per cent.Quebec added 8,500 jobs in November and, compared to 12 months earlier, employment there climbed by two per cent.Nova Scotia saw a month-over-month increase of 0.8 per cent in November by adding 3,700 jobs. The increase, however, was fuelled by part-time work as the province lost 200 full-time positions.Follow @AndyBlatchford on TwitterAndy Blatchford, The Canadian PressGet local stories you won't find anywhere else right to your inbox.Sign up herePrevious storyHome support top issue facing Cariboo seniorsNext storyRCMP searching for woman with outstanding warrantsJust Posted3 deaths, 234 new cases of COVID-19 in Interior Health over the weekendOne death connected to outbreak at Kamloops’ Royal Inland Hospital, where 20 patients and 28 staff have tested positiveCOVID-19 outbreak declared over at Williams Lake Seniors Village: Interior HealthIH credited the good work of staff in keeping the outbreak from spreadingMud Mountain Haulers shine light on forest industryNew TV show, featuring Lebeau Brothers Logging and shot in the Cariboo, premieres tonight.Williams Lake Mounties capture man wanted on Canada-wide warrantDavid Morin, 26, was arrested Jan. 22Semi-truck crashes down 200-foot embankment off Highway 97The truck also spilled diesel fuel into Cuisson CreekVIDEO: Vintage military plane gets towed from Chilliwack to Greater VictoriaGrumman CP-121 Tracker’s eventual home the British Columbia Aviation Museum on Vancouver Island48 COVID-19 cases and one death associated with outbreak at Kamloops hospitalOne of the 20 patients infected has died, meanwhile 28 staff with COVID-19 are isolating at homeIs it time to start thinking about greener ways to package cannabis?Packaging suppliers are still figuring eco-friendly and affordable packaging options that fit the mandates of Cannabis Regulations2nd COVID vaccine doses on hold as B.C. delivery delayed againNew COVID-19 cases slowing in Fraser Health regionB.C. now has three cases of South African COVID-19 variant, six of U.K. strainBoth variants are thought to spread faster than earlier strainsGreat Canadian Gaming CEO resigns after being accused of sneaking into Yukon for vaccineRod Baker and Ekaterina Baker were charged with two CEMA violations eachDoorman of makeshift ‘booze-can’ in Vancouver apartment fined; police look to court orderThis marks the fourth complaint about social gatherings inside the apartment in JanuaryKelowna couple welcomes baby girl from Hotel Zed Nooner campaignNicole and Alex will now have 18 years of free stays at the hotelKamloops Blazer paralyzed in snowboarding accident sparks fundraiser for familyAs of Jan. 24, more than $68,000 had been raised to help Kamloops Blazers’ forward Kyrell SopotykMost ReadLETTER: We are seeing an increase in positive exposures in our schoolsSchool District 27 superintendent Chris van der Mark pens a letter to familiesIn-person church services support wrong call, and a conflict, says Williams Lake residentJohn Pickford takes mayor and council to task in a letterSemi-truck crashes down 200-foot embankment off Highway 97The truck also spilled diesel fuel into Cuisson CreekFOREST INK: Recreation information for Williams Lake and surrounding areas: part twoCommunity groups have been developing the Cariboo as a world leader in outdoor recreationWilliams Lake Mounties capture man wanted on Canada-wide warrantDavid Morin, 26, was arrested Jan. 22DriveBC warns of compact snow, slippery sections on Cariboo Chilcotin highwaysTemperatures will remain below zero through the weekKamloops Blazer paralyzed in snowboarding accident sparks fundraiser for familyAs of Jan. 24, more than $68,000 had been raised to help Kamloops Blazers’ forward Kyrell SopotykExplore Williams Lake TribuneNEWSSPORTSTRENDING NOWBUSINESSENTERTAINMENTLIFECOMMUNITYOPINIONVIDEOSWEATHEROBITUARIESTRAVELMARKETPLACECONTESTSCONTACT USBLACK PRESS MEDIAQuesnel Cariboo Observer100 Mile House Free PressAshcroft-Cache Creek JournalClearwater North Thompson TimesBarriere Star JournalCoast Mountain NewsContact UsOur TeamPrivacy PolicyTerms of useSite MapWilliams Lake NewsWilliams Lake WeatherWilliams Lake Classifieds© 2021, Williams Lake Tribune and Black Press Group Ltd.Close ad"
