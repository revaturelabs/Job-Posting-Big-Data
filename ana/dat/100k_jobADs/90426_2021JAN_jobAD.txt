The National Association of Software and Services Companies in India (NASSCOM) Information Technology–Business Process Management (IT–BPM) industry FY2015 performance review states that India has been able to retain its leadership position in business process outsourcing, despite competitive challenges presented by emerging off-shoring destinations such as Philippines, China and Singapore. These global sourcing services are largely delivered to off-shore destinations across the world through call centres. For India, this has been possible due to a unique set of factors that multiply its value proposition. The key factors being unparalleled cost advantage and being world’s largest pool of employable talent. Despite these positive factors, the call centre jobs, as research suggests, are perceived negatively. The key question then is: India being a massive hub for the call centre jobs, wherein more and more workforce opt for it annually, is it justified to state that it is only doing harm to the employees than good?An article from the South Asian Journal of Human Resources Management questions the negative generalization of call centre jobs for the Indian population by studying three broad issues:If call centres are associated with negative work outcomes, then why do people opt for these jobs?If these are high-stress jobs then does it influence the workforce alike?Have the previous studies on call centres missed the link of self-worth and job-worth?In the context of India, because of the abundance of English-speaking graduates, call centres are the important source of employment generation. With differentiated labour markets utilizing more semi-skilled workforce, those employees who are getting more monetary benefits for their limited skills lead to greater self-expectations, thereby, it is expected that these would generate more positive experiences on the job.However, among the primary issues that are usually reported on call centres are concerns of burnout. The article argues that burnout experiences do not always have a negative impact on the employee’s self-worth. The relationship is, instead, moderated by the impact of job-worth, which acts as a potential individual resource.If you are interested to seek answers to the mind boggling questions related to BPO's, register here to read the full article.Get linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther AppsCommentsessay writing service australia October 14, 2017 10:13 pmAn eye opening blog which shows how the government, locals and citizens everyone becomes a barrier which is not even visible to them other than the women.ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous October 24, 2017 2:29 pmMany thanks for your comment.

Dr. Ramaswamy , author of our bestselling textbook Marketing Management: Indian Context Global Perspective, SIXTH EDITION published by SAGE , shares his views on what makes the students say “ I'm lovin' marketing” . ' While agreeing to contribute to this Blog, I had failed to notice that the request had come with a stringent limit on word-count. I am used to writing books of 5 lakh words! Me, to write something within 350 words? No chance, used as I am for elaboration, not condensing. But, it had to be done. I picked a “mini-feature” of this book and wrote this “mini-blog” on it! The “mini-cases” in the book is the “mini-feature” I am referring to, and this “mini blog” is on this mini-feature. ' - Dr. Ramaswamy Marketing books must make students say , “ I'm lovin' marketing”.

It is heartening that our recentUniversal Elementary Education in India: A Reality or Fantasy?India adopted the National Policy on Education in 1986 marking a landmark moment in the education movement of our country. Alongside the spirit of the education policy, in 2002, with the 86th Amendment Act, the Constitution of India inserted the provision of free and compulsory education for all children in the age group of 6–14 years as a fundamental right. In order to legislate this provision, the Right to Education (RTE) Act was formulated in 2009, while the Right to Education (RTE) Act has made progress in access to education; the delivery of education has worsened. An article from Social Change analyses the reasons for this by using two main levers of the system: financial support and accountability . As far as support is concerned, three areas need attention, specifically, the low funding of education when compared with the global average; a mismatch between funds approved, actual funds available and funds spent; and inefficient, delayed and rushed expenditure.

Often issues resulting out of globalising economic and cultural forces are neglected. The concepts of mental illness, distress are not just determined by the structures present in society but are also mediated by the interaction between the structures and individuals. An article in the journal of Psychology and Developing Societies moves away from the mental illness paradigm through which distress of women is usually understood. With the help of narratives, it seeks to explore the distress of women in the context of the community they live in and the gender roles they negotiate. It identifies the relationship between urban environment and mental health, and looks at the various socio-cultural, economic and political forces that influence the everyday lives of women in India. The article explicates that the household, in more ways than one, is located at the centre of women’s lives, being both the objectPowered by Blogger"
