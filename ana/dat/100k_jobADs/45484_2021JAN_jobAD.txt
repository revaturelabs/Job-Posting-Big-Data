It’s not my fault … I can’t help the way I look.”Her three years of employment at the lab were marred by constant romantic propositions, and she felt she was never taken seriously.“Male colleagues were only interested in me for how I looked.“I wanted them to recognise my achievements and my professionalism but all they saw was my face and body.”It got to the point where she felt “traumatised” when gifts were constantly left on her desk.“Even when I was in a laboratory in scrubs with no makeup they still came on to me because of my natural attractiveness. Problems escalated when her female co-workers began to resent her for her appearance.She told the Daily Mirror: “They assumed because I was pretty, I was stupid, so didn’t take me seriously at first and because of their own insecurities were jealous of my looks.“Then when they realised I was very good at my job, possibly better than them, they hated me even more.”On the rare occasions they invited her to lunch or after-work drinks, she was asked to “sit facing a different direction because men were staring at me, not them”.She is the latest of a series of women to complain about the downsides of beauty.Daily Mail columnist Samantha Brick – a self-described tall, slim, good-looking blonde – caused a stir last year when she wrote about how her looks meant a life of gifts from men and disdain from women.In 2010, New York banker Debrahlee Lorenzana made headlines when she claimed she was fired because her bosses “thought she was too hot” and her office presence was too distracting for them.By Morgan Tait Email MorganOriginal article:Share this postShare on facebookShare on googleShare on twitterShare on linkedinShare on pinterestShare on printShare on emailSIGN UP FOR OUR PROMOTIONS & MORE	NameEmailSIGN UPGET SOCIAL WITH US	Facebook Pinterest Instagram YoutubeCALL US	EMAIL US	Copyright © 2009-2021 Salon Deauville	Powered with ♡ by Salon Deauville.Scroll to Top"
