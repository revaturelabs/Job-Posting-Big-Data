"Job Interview Style: Loving Leota Dresses - Pocketful of JoulesSkip to contentPocketful of JoulesMenuHomeAbout JoulesContactJob Interview Style: Loving Leota DressesAs I was preparing for my first and second job interview, I did that thing where I basically tried on everything in my closet and threw it on the floor.Nothing seemed right.I wanted something where I felt professional and attractive and FUN. But I wanted to stay away from looking too girly or immature or casual. I wanted to look like ME and not me dressed in a job interview costume.I needed a magic dress.I’m not a suit person, so I knew going into it that I wanted a dress and would top it with a blazer and add a pair of flats.I ended up finding my magic dress at Nordstrom Rack.V-neck not too low: check! Knee-length skirt: check! Fun pattern: CHECK!!!I love the Leota brand because their dresses are made out of a soft jersey material that doesn’t wrinkle. They tend to have super flattering wrap waistbands and lots of fun patterns. They do have shorter versions, but I love the knee-length options!Since I’ve been obsessed with my Leota dresses for a year or so now, I thought I’d do some internet stalking to find some favorites to share.They have a ton of options on the Leota website, as well as Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack. Their dresses typically range from $125 – $150 though so I thought it would be more fun to hunt out the sale options for you all:Nordstrom RackSource: NordstromRack.comFaux Wrap Dress, $62.97Ruffle Hem Dress, $59.97Mindy Midi Dress, $79.97NordstromSource: Nordstrom.comJersey Dress, Plus, on sale for $88.80Leota WebsiteSource: Leota.comPerfect Wrap, Strawberry Patch, on sale for $118.00Tiffany Dolman Sleeve, Malibu, on sale for $78.00Sweetheart, Ever After, Plus, on sale for $74.00Also, don’t forget to check Poshmark by searching for the Leota brand name in your size.
