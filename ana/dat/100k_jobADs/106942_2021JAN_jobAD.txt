If you need assets for your game tryOpenGameArt.org or save some money and buy assets in one of the many market places that you canfind online. The prices there are often very affordable.GouryJoined 1 Jul, 20124 topics • 48 posts110 Oct, 2014QuoteHello Games!Designer is opposite of artist.Design is pure technical thing.You cant be good designer nor yo can find any good designer unless you realize that messing design with art is just malicous trend.Try Construct 3Develop games in your browser.
