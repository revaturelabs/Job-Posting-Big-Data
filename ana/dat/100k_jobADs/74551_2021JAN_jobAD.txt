All you need to do is guess Rambo’s job!We all have jobs, everyone in the family has a role to play and a part in that family unit: including the animals. I have three furbabies, two dogs and a rather fluffy cat. They all bring completely different elements to the family, they all have different jobs. It is amazing at how different the dogs are, physically and mentally. Rambo, our Jack Russell is very rigid and if you pick him up he feels very muscly and his body is just stiff as a board. Whereas, when you pick Snoopy, our Cockerspaniel, up he is really floppy and cuddly. He will quite literally wrap his paws around you. Now, that doesn’t mean to say that Snoopy is more cuddly, Rambo loves his cuddles, it’s just amazing how different their bodies are designed. It is always a good idea to protect these amazing little bodies, I do not know what I would do if I needed to get one of the animals operated on and I didn’t have the funds to pay for it, I have always made sure the animals are covered with pet insurance. My job is to look after my little pets and to protect them at all times and their job is to just be happy, be part of the family and make us happy.How do I win?To be in with a chance of winning £100’s worth of vouchers for PetsPyjamas, all I want you to do is come up with a catchy job for my little Rambo based on what he’s doing in the photo above and video below and write a comment on this blog post. Watch the PetPlan video on YouTube for inspiration, it is so adorable seeing all the little animals and the funny captions – they really do look like they’re saying those things! The competition closes in one week, midnight on Saturday 2nd May 2015. Good luck.PetsPyjamas £100 voucher giveawayShare this:TwitterFacebookPinterestEmailLike this:Like Loading...Share0accessoriescompetitionFamilyHappyinsuranceleadspetPetPlanpetplanukpetsPets PyjamaspetspyjamasplanprotectedpyjamasUK	Subscribe so you don’t miss a postSign up with your email address to receive news and updates!I have read and agree to the Privacy PolicypreviouslySaturday 25 April 2015up nextMy #GetFit plans so far and what’s aheadYou Might Also LikePlum – Hove Dolls HousePosted on December 16, 2013 July 19, 2018#Competition – Win a hamper of Jamie Oliver/Moshi Monster goodiesPosted on April 9, 2015Mothercare are offering 15% off…Posted on September 4, 2013 January 9, 2019How to ensure boredom is never a problem in your family homePosted on October 7, 2020 October 8, 2020Join in with the fun wildlife competitionPosted on September 23, 2016Handmade jewellery is something extra specialPosted on December 16, 2014What do you think?

I wrote a fairly long comment on this but it looks my comment has disappeared 🙁 Did I break a house rule or something?Reply	Sarah FranksMay 2, 2015	I’ll try submitting my proposed job description for Rambo again, but I don’t think I can remember it all the same as the first submission…I’ll confess I’m a little bit devastated that my original post seems to have been lost. Hoping this one doesn’t go the same way.RAMBO’S JOB DESCRIPTION:The Guru Rambo Pratama Vishnu has developed a new form of yogic practice that draws upon the Eastern tradition of stretching, movement, and meditation, while simultaneously including thorough exfoliation using only the most natural wild sand and wild grass. This new yogic movement has found favour among modern spiritualists living busy lives, who lack the time to both practice yoga and exfoliate separately. The Guru Rambo’s new form of yogic practice promises to develop both inner and outer beauty at the same time, increasing the harmony of inner and outer physical and spiritual states. If this yoga were a form of washing up liquid, it would bear tag lines such as, “New and improved formula!”By exfoliating during the yogic practice, his followers also reap the benefits of boosting the circulatory systems thereby allowing their Chakras to balance themselves more quickly, since the improved blood flow helps the Chakras to move into balance without the impediment of a sluggish circulatory system.The Guru Rambo has found ardent fans across the board, from the Dalai Lama, to the footballer Joey Barton, and Harry Styles from One Direction.In a past life, the Guru Rambo was the individual responsible for pointing the Beatles towards their highly creative Eastern-influenced period, by first appearing to them in the form of the Eggman. He uttered the yogic mantra, “Goo goo g’ joob goo goo g’ joob”, which the Beatles intuitively understood and complied with, by going to India and studying the sitar with the sitar master, Ravi Shankar. He takes no responsibility for (and offers no opinion positive or negative about) Yoko Ono, however.These days, the Guru Rambo lives a happy life, spreading the word among dogs and humans alike, about the many benefits of yogic exfoliation. Despite having left his Eggman days behind him, he does retain a naturally inquisitive fondness for any Walruses he meets.Reply	Jonathan MasonMay 2, 2015	Sarah Franks’ comment is hilarious – has to be the winnerReply	C KennedyMay 2, 2015	Living hooverReply	Natalie CrossanMay 2, 2015	prime ministerReply	Bonjour!I'm Sonia, and this is my creative space.
