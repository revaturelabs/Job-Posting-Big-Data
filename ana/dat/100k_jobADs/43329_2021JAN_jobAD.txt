I reckon it‚Äôs both.Today, I feel better. Prayer and outreach do help issues pass. Lifeline Helpline is a Godsend for me.I bought a free-range chicken on Thursday, at the butcher with a 10% off discount through the voucher from my Slimming World group, and have the bird in my slow cooker until roughly 1 pm today. However, I gained two pounds in the past weigh-in.Later, today, I will visit my neighbour. While Ireland faces the All-Blacks in less than an hour in the Rugby Union World Cup Quarter-Final. I reckon we‚Äôll beat them, but get walloped by England in the Semi-Final; I tipped England to win the whole thing before the tournament began. üòÄTunes:Jools Holland and George Harrison ‚Äì Horse to the WaterTagged Aspergers Syndrome, Batman, Christianity, David Bowie, David Bowie RIP, George Harrison, George Harrison RIP, Healthy Eating, Humor, Ireland, Isolation, Jools Holland, MadLipz, Mental Health, Northern Ireland, Parody, REM, Rugby World Cup 2019, Schizophrenia, Slimming World, Slow Cooker, Slow Food Movement, The Penguin, Unemployment, United KingdomLeave a comment	Blog at WordPress.com.Privacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
