She had returned to prepare the store for reopening under the easing level 3 lockdown conditions on 1 June.With alcohol in high demand during the lockdown period, the store was secured from the outside throughout.But the suspects avoided the mall’s main entrance and instead used electrical and stormwater tunnels beneath the shopping centre to gain access to an area beneath the store. They then tunnelled through the solid concrete floor directly into the liquor shop to gain access undetected, Shoprite said.It is unclear how the thieves knew where to tunnel, nor how long it took them to get through the thick concrete floor, but they returned a few times to steal a large amount of stock.Shoprite loss control manager, Oswald Meiring, said that the suspects were first recorded on CCTV cameras on 21 May – just 10 days before liquor sales were allowed.Footage from inside the store shows three suspects, although more could have remained in the tunnel to help move the large quantity of liquor stolen.Meiring said that the thieves made off with whiskey, brandy, gin, cider, vodka, and beer with an estimated value of R300,000.South Africa officially moved to level 3 lockdown on Monday, 1 June with the government introducing a host of new regulations around what citizens can and cannot do.As part of the level 3 regulatory changes, South Africans will now be allowed to purchase alcohol.The regulations state that the sale of liquor will be permitted between Monday and Thursday, from 09h00 – 17h00. Online sales will be subject to the same times, while no liquor may be consumed onsite.Read: Level 3 lockdown rules in South Africa – here are all the changes from todaySubscribeMust ReadPush to make climate change education part of school curriculumSouth African regulator backs distribution of AstraZeneca shotsCovid-19 pandemic could be source of global crises for years: WEFBeware these 2 types of mobile fraud in South AfricaPartner ContentTopAuto – Motoring news for South AfricansWhy marketing during a tough economy is crucial for businessesAcer Aspire 5 – Now with 11th-Gen Intel processorsThe best way to move your belongings from South Africa to the UKShow commentsJoin the conversation Autoload commentsComments section policy: Any attacks on BusinessTech, its journalists, or other readers will result in a ban.PollDo you have a prepaid electricity meter?YesNoView ResultsLoading ...Trending NowNew case deals with a South African employee who refused to come into work during lockdownGovernment ‘monitoring’ decline in Covid-19 transmissions, which is key to reviewing lockdown in South AfricaHow to apply for an Australian partner visa – and how much it costsLandlords in South Africa have run into a real problemThe 10 biggest risks for business in South Africa in 2021Follow UsSubscribePictures: Thieves tunnel into Joburg liquor store during lockdownAll the level 3 lockdown changes for South African workers this week Next articleANC to use coronavirus pandemic to push other changes in South Africa: economists Previous articleCategoriesBankingBroadbandBusinessFinanceMotoringIndustry NewsIT ServicesMobileTelecomsWealthInformationAboutAdvertise with usContactInternet Speed TestMyBroadband Speed TestBlack FridayFollow UsFacebookTwitterNewsletterRSSAbout | Advertise with us | ContactSubscribe to our daily newsletterSubscribe"
