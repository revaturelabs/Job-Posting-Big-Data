The unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, shattering the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982.In a statement, Ross said the advisory board’s meeting comes at a “challenging” time, but expressed confidence the president’s policies will lead to a rapid rebound.Ivanka Trump said in a separate statement the board will work to find “solutions to combat the job loss caused by this pandemic and help the unemployed get reconnected to the workforce.”“By rallying around this call to action, leaders in business and government can help more people build skills that lead to good jobs, promote hiring that is based on skills not just degrees, and build a national skills infrastructure to connect workers with opportunities,” IBM’s Rometty said in a statement.Four major companies -- Walmart Inc, Salesforce , IBM Corp and Workday Inc -- are announcing Tuesday they are creating “Interoperable Learning Records” to help workers and employers match applicants with jobs, the official said.
