As a result, AHS has been directed to proceed carefully, putting patient care above all else,” said Health Minister Tyler Shandro.“As a first step, AHS has been directed to eliminate a minimum of 100 management positions and to proceed with previously announced contracting work. This approach will allow us to strike the right balance between supporting the COVID-19 response and Alberta’s challenging fiscal situation.”The Canadian Taxpayers Federation said they supported Shandro’s efforts.“Today’s announcement is an excellent step to make Alberta’s health-care system more efficient,” said Franco Terrazzano, Alberta Director for the CTF.“Alberta’s businesses do a great job of doing laundry and preparing meals, so this is a no-brainer to help relieve some of the mounting costs to taxpayers.”The CTF said the Alberta government would save $3.6 billion annually if its per person health-care spending was in line with Ontario, B.C. and Quebec, according to the Blue Ribbon Panel on Alberta’s finances. The Alberta government spends more per person on health care than every other province except Newfoundland and Labrador.“Finding savings through attrition, outsourcing and reducing management bureaucrats is necessary to find savings in Alberta’s high-cost health-care system,” said Terrazzano.Dave Naylor is the News Editor of the Western Standarddnaylor@westernstandardonline.comTWITTER: Twitter.com/nobby7694Support Dave Naylor’s WorkRelated Topics:ablegabpoliAHSAlbertashandrotopUp NextSask Party, NDP release election platformsDon't MissLiberal delays of proposed Alberta pipeline puts back construction at least a yearDave NaylorDave Naylor is the News Editor of the Western Standard and the Vice-President: News Division of Western Standard New Media Corp.

Manufacturer Pfizer has said Canada will not receive any doses this week.“We need more doses – now,” said Shandro, adding Alberta is currently ready to vaccinate 50,000 people a day when the shipments resume.He noted Canada has only vaccinated two per cent of the population, while in the US, the figure is six per cent and the UK, ten per cent.Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said regulations will be relaxed “as soon as it’s safe.”She said in the last 24 hours, Alberta has found 362 new cases of the virus, along with 25 deaths. The positivity rate is 5 per cent.It’s is the fewest number of new cases in a day since Oct. 23.Dave Naylor is the News Editor of the Western Standarddnaylor@westernstandardonline.comTWITTER: Twitter.com/nobby7694Continue ReadingNewsAlberta RCMP find man who was wearing KKK hood in GrimshawThe picture hit social media in early January with townsfolk wondering in the KKK has set up a chapter in GrimshawPublished7 hours agoonJanuary 25, 2021ByDave NaylorRCMP in Grimshaw say they have identified a man who was photographed at the town post office wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood.Now it’s in the hands of the Crown to determine whether charges are laid.The picture hit social media in early January with townsfolk wondering in the KKK has set up a chapter in Grimshaw, located 25 km west of Peace River.The photo was passed on to the RCMP who launched an investigation.“Following several investigative steps, Peace Regional RCMP believe to have identified the individual involved in this incident.

Anyone that thinks it is, certainly doesn’t understand how the economy works and how science works and so it’s just going to be a struggle,” he said.“We’re in for a number of years of struggle while we also work on the next set of alternatives.”In addition to halting Keystone, Biden renewed the U.S. commitment to the Paris climate accord last Wednesday, the first day he was in power.Hofmeister said Biden’s move will create huge uncertainty in the energy industry.“It creates a great deal of uncertainty, which is very difficult to manage in a business that requires billions of dollars and years of planning,” Hofmeister, who retired as head of Shell in 2008, told Fox.“We’re not going to get rid of fossil fuels in a four-year term or an eight-year term of an administration. It’s just not going to happen. What will happen is that the price of oil will go up and the production of U.S. oil will go down.”Alberta has billions of dollars tied up in the cancelled project, with $1.5 billion of taxpayers’ money handed to operator TC Energy already, along with $6 billion in loan guarantees.In a letter to Trudeau Friday, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney claims when Biden cancelled the Keystone XL pipeline expansion project on Wednesday, he broke several free trade regulations.“At the very least, I call upon the government of Canada to press the US Administration to compensate TC Energy, and the Alberta government, for billions of dollars of cost incurred in the construction of Keystone XL to date,” Kenney’s letter said.During the Democratic primaries and campaign, Biden vowed to kill the pipeline, large portions of which have already been built in Alberta. He made the vow before Alberta invested it’s money.Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, have also said in the past they would put an end to fracking, a promise they did not repeat during the campaign.The Keystone pipeline runs from Alberta to refineries in Illinois and Texas.The new pipeline would have run from Hardisty, Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska.Dave Naylor is the News Editor of the Western Standarddnaylor@westernstandardonline.comTWITTER: Twitter.com/nobby7694Continue ReadingLatestTrendingVideosNews6 hours agoCOVID lockdown remains as new virus variants found in Alberta ‘a serious threat’News7 hours agoAlberta RCMP find man who was wearing KKK hood in GrimshawOpinion7 hours agoMcCOLL: As Scheer did unto Trost, O’Toole did unto SloanNews1 month ago‘My life had value’ – message from Calgary woman who died with pre-existing conditionsOpinion2 months agoMUST-READ: Open letter from a doctor to Jason KenneyNews2 months agoSenior doc says Alberta politicians “playing medicine”, media driving “hysteria”Watch3 months agoWATCH: CTF on “eye popping” AHS management compensation levelsNews4 months agoCORY MORGAN WEBCAST: Wild goose hunt, Alberta styleOpinion12 months agoWATCH: License to Speak: Liberal Censorship, TMX Win, and the Democrats Fall in IowaExternal AdvertisementSign up for the Western Standard NewsletterFree news and updates	Email Address*First NameLast NamePhone Number** = required field	unsubscribe from listRecent PostsCOVID lockdown remains as new virus variants found in Alberta ‘a serious threat’Alberta RCMP find man who was wearing KKK hood in GrimshawMcCOLL: As Scheer did unto Trost, O’Toole did unto SloanFormer Shell head says Biden’s Keystone move ‘makes no sense’Trudeau boots MP from caucus for making ‘baseless threats’ against colleaguesRecent Commentswarrenzoell on COVID lockdown remains as new virus variants found in Alberta ‘a serious threat’Greg Misquitta on Former Liberal MP calls Trudeau a ‘fool’ unconcerned with increasing costswarrenzoell on Alberta RCMP find man who was wearing KKK hood in GrimshawTrust but verify on MORGAN: Trans Mountain may be the next victim of Ottawa’s indifferenceCharles Martell III on Campaign Life president says O’Toole should resignTrendingNews2 days agoFormer Liberal MP calls Trudeau a ‘fool’ unconcerned with increasing costsNews3 days agoRCMP union launches campaign to stop Alberta provincial forceOpinion4 days agoMcALLISTER: Nenshi’s regional board is at war with rural developmentEnergy2 days agoANDERSON: If Ottawa Won’t Sanction the US, Alberta Must Sanction OttawaNews2 days agoWIP leader Hinman says Alberta should shut off natural gas taps to US after Keystone cancellationNews4 days agoGov.-Gen.
