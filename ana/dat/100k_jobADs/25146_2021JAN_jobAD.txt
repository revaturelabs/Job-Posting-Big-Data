The strike notice is being considered by the Communications Workers’ Union who had previously been in talks with Vodafone over the transfers. The Communications Workers’ Union also want the change over date, which is currently set for the 8th of May, to be changed until talks have been concluded. Vodafone, which had previously promised all workers would have the opportunity to transfer to Newry, is now admitting that this will not be possible and only some workers will be offered a transfer. A statement from the union today read, “This decision impacts 26 Vodafone roles and 290 roles with the existing third party contractor, Rigney Dolphin. Vodafone acknowledge that many roles affected may relocate to Newry, where Teleperformance is headquartered. The company also recognises that some employees may not be in a position to relocate in these circumstances. The consultation process is ongoing in order to explore all concerns and provide a forum for agreement.” More on this story: Vodafone staff meet with Minister for Enterprise over proposed Newry jobs Concern over Teleperformance jobs reaches Dáil Éireann Newry telecommunications centre set to take over Vodafone staffBoth comments and pings are currently closed.1 Comment for “Outrage as Vodafone jobs move to Newry”Adams calls for ministerial intervention in Vodafone Call Centre debacle - Newry Times | Newry TimesApril 27, 2012 - 1:10 pm	[…] speculators while gradually running down its operation in Ireland.” More on this story: Outrage as Vodafone jobs move to Newry Vodafone staff meet with Minister for Enterprise over proposed Newry jobs Concern over […]Comments are closedRecent Entries“We cannot ease up in our fightback” – Health Minister Robin Swann“Don’t add to huge pressures on our Health Service” – Newry MLARed Audi A3 taken in Newry “creeper-style burglary”Knife-wielding man sought after Newry attempted robberyTravellers from South America “must self-isolate and get tested”Newry residents urged to use postcode Broadband CheckerFinance Minister Conor Murphy reflects on first year in officeBuggy Club NI raises funds for children’s charityExtension to community pharmacy seasonal flu vaccination services announcedJustice Minister launches public consultation on reform of rehabilitation periods-->	NewsPoliticsBusinessSportCommunityFeaturesOld NewryJobs & CareersThis website does not share personal information with third parties nor do we store any information about your visit other than to analyze and optimize your content and reading experience through the use of cookies.
