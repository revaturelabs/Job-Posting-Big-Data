More from the Washington Examiner:Expected to sell at least 10,000-12,000 in the first two weeks and propel The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation onto the newspaper’s bestseller hardcover list, it has sold about a third of that in the first two weeks.A publishing source provided the latest BookScan numbers, which can account for about 80% of sales. That number is 3,120. “If you add in ebooks — they may have sold a total of 4,000. That’s one of the most epic bombs in political publishing over the past decade,” said the source.The book-buying public must be losing its appetite for fiction.Guessing the Kavanaugh book by @MZHemingway @Regnery sold a ton more with a fraction of the MSM attention, and by fraction I mean none— Cameron Gray (@Cameron_Gray) October 4, 2019TrendingSharyl Attkisson & others do a #1A fact check on Penn.
