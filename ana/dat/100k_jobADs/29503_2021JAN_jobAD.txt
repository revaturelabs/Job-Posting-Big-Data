We are surrounded by applications on our desktop computers and smartphones, and we literally come across software wherever we go. The job of a QA engineer is to make sure that this software, that we’re all likely to come into contact with at some point during a day, runs as smooth as possible, and to find errors before the user finds them first.QA engineers also ensure that systems operate and comply with the requirements and regulations set out by developers.
