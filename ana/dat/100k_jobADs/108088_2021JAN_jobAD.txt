No longer. What’s changed? Travel-related stress. No one wants it, everyone faces it.In 2016, booking.com undertook a survey to quantify the causes of travel stress, questioning more than 4,555 respondents who travelled at least four times a year. Of them, 93% suffered from stress at some point in their journey. The top three worries: missing a flight (32% of respondents), language barrier on arrival (26%) and the possibility that luggage would be lost (22%).Oddly, my own biggest worry was way down the list – losing my passport, a concern only 18% of my fellow passengers share. Nonetheless, I’ve had mine stolen in a New York airport and again on La Rambla in Barcelona. In my opinion, no experience comes close in terms of inconvenience and, yes, stress. Now I carry a photo copy of the passport and a spare credit card separately and hang the originals around my neck the way pilgrims to Santiago once carried a scallop shell.I don’t worry about the language barrier; there’s an app for that. I use Google Translate. There are others – for an overview: www.k-international.com.But cancelled flights do come in second for me, ever since the frantic scramble for a seat on an onward flight after a cancellation in Catania, Sicily. I had a top-level frequent flyer card on the air-line in question, and discovered loyalty pays! I also had a membership card giving me access to a lounge where the receptionist mercifully sorted my ticket. www.prioritypass.comMy own third concern – an accident abroad – didn’t figure in the booking.com survey. But when I woke up in a Boston hospital a day after being concussed by a falling roof tile (I didn’t see that coming!), I couldn’t remember where I was staying, or where my belongings were. Now I carry a card from the hotel I’ve checked into – ‘just in case’.There’s not much you can do about the stress of lost luggage, aside from carrying essentials in your hand luggage. However, stuck without my bags in Lyon, Air France provided me with an overnight amenity kit containing a toothbrush, an oversized tee shirt, two aspirin and a condom. Now that’s one worry off my mind.﻿Latest Articles16 Dec - Bag-in-lens in young eyes - Tips and tricks for successful implantation of the bag-in-the-lens IOL.14 Dec - Future technologies for glaucoma diagnosis - The next 40 years is likely to see advances in the diagnosis of glaucoma using technologies that are now in their infancy03 Dec - Editorial: Re-inventing gatherings - EuroTimes Editorial December 2020/January 2021 Volume 25 Issue 12/Volume 26 Issue 103 Dec - J&J gets real - Functional device measures, support for practices bring innovative tech to life03 Dec - Complications of the anterior segment - The retina is mysterious and intimidating and retinal complications are dreaded by all ophthalmologists03 Dec - Chief development officer03 Dec - Glaucoma diagnosis using OCT - Step-by-step approach holds the key to accurate clinical application of OCT information03 Dec - Artificial Intelligence and ophthalmology - AI set to be used in more eyecare applications03 Dec - Automatic IOL inserters - Preloaded motorised devices may stretch incisions less than manual inserters03 Dec - A deeper look at the lens - How visual outcomes can be optimised in cataract patientsTweets by @eurotimesPopular ContentCoronavirus and ophthalmology11th March 2020COVID-19 guidelines from Italy18th March 2020Conjunctivitis and COVID-1917th March 2020The myopia epidemic – can we stop it?1st November 2016New intraocular lenses1st February 2018Articles by CategoryBreaking NewsCataract and Refractive ArticlesCorneaEditorialEye on TravelFeaturesHospital DiaryGlaucomaIndustry NewsOcularRetinaYoung OphthalmologistsAbout EuroTimesEuroTimes is published by the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS), Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland.The ESCRS is a leading forum in Europe for discussion, learning and the development of cataract and refractive surgery.Find out more about EuroTimesStay updated on all PlatformsStay updated on all our online platforms.
