"Sriz Beauty Blog: Is Laundry Only A Woman's Job?PagesHomeAboutMy Posts on Wiseshe.comContact/PRMonday, January 19, 2015Is Laundry Only A Woman's Job?Drawing from the recent findings of a Nielsen India Survey on Indian Households supported by Ariel India, Shilpa Shetty Kundra, Neha Dhupia & Mandira Bedi spark a pan-India debate to draw attention to this very important question ''Is Laundry Only A Woman's Job?''.The results of the survey reveal that more than 2/3rd of Indian women feel, there exists inequality at home, between men and women.Is Laundry Only A Woman's Job?The below picture shows some of the telling household statistics that emerged in Ariel’s survey conducted by AC Nielsen.Is Laundry Only A Woman's Job?Is Laundry really Only A Woman's Job? My Answer will be Absolutely No!!! Because in olden days ,when only Men used to go for work that time, Women used to take care of all the household chores like cooking,cleaning,laundry etc.,because they used to stay at home.But ,Now the days have been changed and most of the Women are working similar to men.Hence,the household chores has to be shared equally by both Men and women.To discuss about the first two Statistics which says that'' more than 2/3rd of Indian women feel, there exists inequality at home, between men and women'' and'' 76% of Indian Men feel Laundry is a Women's Job'' .Yes!!! In most of the houses,Men feel that they are superior over women and believe that the household works like cooking,laundry are only meant for women.They feel that these are low standard works which should be done only by women and feel inferior to help women in these works.But,all these household works are not sub standard works and something which make you inferior.Is Laundry Only A Woman's Job?During the early days of our marriage,I was out of the town for one month due to some rituals at my hometown and my husband had to do all the household chores. Then he realized how difficult is to manage all these works especially Laundry which involves various steps like cleaning,drying,ironing and keeping them properly in cupboard. From then on wards,when ever I am doing laundry,he comes and help me,even If I do not ask him to help. Laundry has become an easy task with the invention of Washing machines and effective Washing powders like Ariel.Men should feel the responsibility about these works as it is their work too.I am feeling lucky as my husband helps me with this.Is Laundry Only A Woman's Job?When it comes to the third Statistics that ''85% of working women feel they have two jobs,one at work and other at home''.This is the most common situation these days,where women have to manage both works while men do only office work and simple relax at home.But does not feel good on their part.As it is not fare for the men to throw all the burden on women shoulders.I request all the men to not to feel shame in helping their wife or mother in the household work.as it is their responsibility to help and make the women happy.There is no need to buy costly gifts to show the love,just help your mother or sister or wife in the day-to-day activities,it means a lot to them and they in turn love u loads.Help India to develop further and stop the inequality,do not pressurize women on the household chores.Is Laundry Only A Woman's Job?Check out the Video for more information!!!“I am writing for #IsLaundryOnlyAWomansJob activity at BlogAdda.com in association with Ariel.”Image souce : GooglePosted by Sri ramani at 8:17 PMEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels: blogadda, Is Laundry Only A Woman's Job?No comments:Post a CommentNewer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)Search This BlogFeatured PostBella Vita Organic Growth Protein Volume Conditioning Shampoo Review!!!Hello, Today I am reviewing one more product from Bella Vita Organic, which is their Growth Protein Volume Conditioning Shampoo , whic...Instagram : sriramani9BlogaddaSubscribe through EmailLike Sriz Beauty Blog on FacebookFacebook BadgeSriz BeautyblogPromote your Page tooSearch Sriz Beauty Blog on GoogleAbout MeSri ramaniView my complete profileFollow me on Blog LovinFollow me on twitterFollow @Sriramani9IndibloggerAdd blog to blog directory at OnToplist.com.Sriz Beauty Blog is aimed at providing honest reviews on beauty and makeup products to the followers.Search this BlogBlog Archive► 2020 (20)► September (2)► August (2)► July (1)► June (1)► May (3)► April (1)► February (2)► January (8)► 2019 (10)► December (5)► September (1)► May (1)► March (2)► January (1)► 2018 (23)► December (2)► November (2)► October (4)► September (1)► August (1)► July (3)► June (1)► April (2)► February (5)► January (2)► 2017 (43)► December (3)► November (3)► October (1)► July (1)► June (5)► May (3)► April (3)► March (3)► February (8)► January (13)► 2016 (175)► December (7)► November (12)► October (14)► September (13)► August (7)► July (13)► June (13)► May (20)► April (20)► March (23)► February (18)► January (15)▼ 2015 (283)► December (15)► November (13)► October (16)► September (16)► August (22)► July (28)► June (19)► May (26)► April (35)► March (36)► February (21)▼ January (36)Ethicare Remedies Hydrofil Emollient Cream ReviewNavarasas Stress Relief Body Butter ReviewSneakpeak of Upcoming Auravedic Products!Win A Trip to Paris this Valentines Day With All ...Fab Bag January 2015 'Beauty Unmasked' Edition ReviewCommon Problems with Pimples!!!Puresense By Soap Opera Lemon Grass Soap ReviewFuschia Arabian Jasmine Anti-ageing Night Cream Re...Sriz Beauty Blog -
