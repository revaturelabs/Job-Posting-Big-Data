Fishing Line Artificial Muscleresearch conducted into the potential of tightly coiled fishing line to haul weight and act as an artificial muscle upon the application of external energy]3 tension difference when heat applied to coiled fishing line… IDEA: fishing line coils could be women into other wearable material to provide contraction feedback in navigation system and thus no need for application of external devices + more stream lined… Tightly coiled fishing line interwoven into other natural fibres (video documentation)… How to heat the actuators using metal coating and electricityThis entry was posted in samanthajobbinswells, Uncategorized on May 12, 2014 by sammy.	Haptic Navigation System – conceptThis entry was posted in samanthajobbinswells, Uncategorized on May 12, 2014 by sammy.	Haptic Interaction/ InterfaceProject Proposal:A wearable navigation system that uses haptic feed back to navigate the cyclist through urban areas, possibly interfaced with a corresponding mobile app.Project Requirements:The system will exploit the navigational advantage afforded by bike riding in urban areas i.e. that the rider shouldn’t necessarily be limited by traditional, legal routes as mandated by google maps and other commercial navigational systems.The wearable component should be as unobtrusive and unrestrictive to the cyclist as possible and with a deliberately ‘un-techy’ aesthetic (use of ‘natural materials?’).Recherche:Haptic Interaction]2 Momo: preprogrammed GPS unit of predetermined locations.
