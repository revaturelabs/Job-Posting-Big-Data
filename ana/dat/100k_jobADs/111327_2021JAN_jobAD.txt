After returning from Fiji, I underwent team leader training and in July 2017 I led a team of university students in Timor Leste for 4 weeks. The leadership training at Project Everest Ventures is challenging, unique and empowering. Becoming further involved with Project Everest Ventures and having the opportunity to team lead in a developing country allowed me to develop immensely both personally and professionally. I believe that my time with Project Everest Ventures has given me a competitive advantage in post university job applications and interviews as my responses focused on my experiences as a team leader throughout the process.Within a month of returning from team leading I was offered a position with a GeoTechincal Company and less than 6 months later I was offered a full-time position with the Australian Hydrographic Office as a Marine Information Officer. The interview panel was very impressed with my practical leadership experience and as a result, I was offered a higher position in the organisation. Every year there are more and more university graduates looking for employment and with job hunting becoming more competitive it is becoming imperative to make your application and resume stand out; for me team leading with Project Everest Venture was how I achieved this.'Browse Graduate JobsLaw Graduate JobsEngineering Graduate JobsAccounting Graduate JobsGraduate Jobs in SydneyGraduate Jobs in MelbourneGraduate Jobs in PerthBrowse InternshipsLaw & Legal Clerkships and InternshipsEngineering InternshipsAccounting InternshipsInternships in SydneyInternships in MelbourneInternships in PerthPopular EmployersAccentureANZGoogle AustraliaDeloitteEYBHPGeneral TermsAboutPartner TermsAdvertise with usAdvertiser TermsContactPrivacy PolicyLinkedInFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubeCopyright 2021 Â© GradAustralia.Graduate Jobs, Internships & Programs in Australia"
