One day, we got a job application from this guy, let’s call him John Doe, that contained exactly the following (translated in English).“Greetings, when can I come over for a job interview”.And again, the above was EVERYTHING there was in the email we received, no more, no less. I was staggered that someone can be ignorant, uninterested and at the end, stupid, to this level. Before I start ranting about his email, let me break down this “job application” and tell you everything I think was wrong with it.There was no email titleHe did not introduce himselfHe did not specify which position he is applying toHe did not provide any background on himselfHe did not attach a CVHe did not have a cover letterHe did not write an email in EnglishThere was no greeting at the end of an emailI know there’s a lot of companies who do not track their job applicants history, but good and serious ones mostly do. It’s very hard to find good help in software engineering these days so if by some miracle you get two great candidates for one job opening you either hire both and then think about where to engage each of them, or you hire the one you like better and save the other person’s CV somewhere so you can call them once there’s a spot for them as well. This is great for serious applicants, however, what if you get saved to the HR DB as a very bad candidate. Do you think next time you eventually apply it will take you same effort to make us like you?NO!!!If you, by some miracle, even get to the interview part of the hiring process, we’ll be much more careful and even reluctant to pick you over other candidates because of the previous bad experience.First impressions matter!!!At the time, we used a Trello board for keeping track of EVERY candidate who applied for a job in our company. Among other, there was a column titled “No, no, no, not Ever“. Yes, you guessed right, this is the column for people who came out as total failures, either with their personality, or with their technical knowledge, but mostly with their personality. But in order to prove themselves “worthy” of the column, they we usually have to first meet with them. John Doe, I think, is the first who was able to break that rule. He reserved his spot on the column without hearing a word from us. I’m relieved though, He saved us an hour or two we may have spent on meeting him.Anyways this guy’s job application left me so befuddled I decided to write a series of articles on bad and good practices when applying for a job, from my own perspective, in the next few weeks. This article is the first one in the series. In the next article I’ll go through all of the bad practices when applying for a job, because in my opinion it’s far worse if you do something you shouldn’t, than not do something you should.Peace out.apply avoid career computer science hiring human resources it job job hunt jobs mistakes network adminstrator software development systems engineer what not to do2 thoughts on “Real life example on how NOT to apply for a job in IT”	Elvedin says:	October 16, 2015 at 10:30 am	Hi. This is my background. Guy you are referring to might have been real genius who needed a bit of guide how to represent himself, but u didnt give him chance. Though, partially i understand your point, i disagree to reject completly on bad intro. Might have been wrong humor.RegardsReplyeedoh says:	October 16, 2015 at 3:08 pm	I see where you’re getting at, and actually I agree. He might have been a genius in disguise. Problem is, we have quite a load of job applications and we can barely meet all the candidates who spent actually more than 4 seconds writing their job applications. How can we rank him if there’s literally no information about himself? We might have responded asking for everything he should have provided by himself, but he just does not leave impression of a guy giving #*@& about the job (whichever he wanted to apply for).However your comment makes me rethink my approach once more and looking for eventual better course of action. Maybe separate column for incomplete applications??ReplyLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
