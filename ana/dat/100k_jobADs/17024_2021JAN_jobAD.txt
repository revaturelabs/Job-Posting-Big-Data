I was not financially compensated for this post but did receive a sample for review purposes. As always, all opinions are entirely my own. Thank you for supporting the brands that support me!Are you expecting a baby soon? Now you want to make a healthy baby nursery?You don’t need to be super-rich to design a safe and healthy baby nursery. You just need to know what sort of things are harmful to your baby and get rid of them.That’s it. And then add elements that promote health!I got some of the easiest ways to tackle this issue. These are the exact same things I did when I had a baby and now you can do them too!!1. Make the Sleeping Area SafeIt’s quite easy to make your baby’s sleep safe. You just need to be careful about 3 things:The mattressThe cribThe loungerYour baby will spend most of the time on the mattress and in the crib. Avoid PVC and chemically treated mattresses and buy a crib that meets the safety standards.Loungers are great for newborn sleeping and perfect for keeping the baby around you while working. Just make sure it is contoured and made from organic elements.2. Create a Toxin-free EnvironmentToxins are everywhere around us. They will find their way inside the nursery.The best way to tackle this issue is to:Use chemical-free sanitizersTry to buy everything organic as much as possibleKeep plastic toys and other stuff outClean the room oftenThese steps might seem tough, but once you plan it out everything will fall into place.3. Use Solid Wood FurnitureWhen planning about the design of the nursery, add solid wood furniture to the list. They might cost more but you will have a lot less to worry about.If you opt for plywood or particleboard furniture, then make sure to apply AFM Safecoat products. It will stop off-gassing toxic fumes!4. Select Safe PaintYour baby’s nursery might have colorful paints all around the room. It’s easier to overlook it, but you need to take into account the harmful effects paints can cause. A 2010 study found that VOCs in paints can cause asthma and rhinitis in children.Here’s a list of safer paints for your baby:Low-VOC and Zero VOC paintsOrganic paintsWater-based paintsMilk paints5. Cut Off Technology as Much as PossibleEMF and other RF signals from portable devices might have links to neurological damage and cancer. You can’t just avoid using one in this day and age! However, you can certainly keep it away from the nursery.It’s a super easy task and something that you should definitely care about. Even if you have to use a baby monitor, look for the ones that have low-emission levels.6. Improve Air Quality of the RoomThe air in our homes is up to 10 times more contaminated than it is outside, and with the growing rate of infant asthma and allergies, keeping the air clean for our children is just as crucial as diapers.Airfree, the world’s most tested air purifier, offering filter-less air purification, has created an air-purifier explicitly made for babies and children’s rooms, called BabyAir.BabyAir is different than your typical air purifier. It uses patented Thermodynamic TSS Technology to destroy common airborne allergens. This means you can say bye-bye to dust mites, pet dander, pollens, mold, tobacco, and other organic allergens.However, my personal favorite is that it destroys viruses and bacteria! I’m a slight germophobe so if signs of a stomach bug or the flu hit our house this baby is running 247 in the danger zone.Airfree BabyAir uses heat to sterilize the air in a similar way people using boiling water. In a fraction of a second, using its 400°F TSS core it destroys all those nasty microorganisms and allergens.It’s super neat and a must-have for parents!This unit is silent and requires no maintenance or filters. A busy, tired mom’s dream!The projection of blue, red, or green stars is just a bonus, in my opinion. You can’t beat its true purpose—giving your family quality air!7. Tone Down the LightingA nursery shouldn’t be a showcase of fancy lights and all glowing designs. Your baby’s sleep cycle can be impacted if you turn on bright lights.So, during the first few months, try to use low-intensity lights. When you come inside for feeding during the night, use dim light or a small lamp. It’s a very simple thing that many parents overlook!8. Reduce NoiseConstant exposure to heavy noises can cause hearing problems in babies. The sweet spot is under 45 dB. But I can’t expect you to keep running around with a noise measuring device.The best way to deal with sound and nearby traffic is to buy a soundproof window. If that’s not an option, you can hang heavy curtains and use carpets on the floor.Final Words…To make a nursery perfectly healthy, you might need to follow more safety precautions. But the things I talked about are super easy to achieve. Trust me, you will be way ahead than many parents I know.It’s much better to talk with a pediatrician than your next-door neighbor when planning about your baby’s nursery. Keep yourself informed and talk to other parents whose babies seem healthier than average.Home Jobs By MomKrystle Cook – the creator of Home Jobs by MOM – put her psychology degree on a shelf and dived into a pile of diapers and dishes instead.
