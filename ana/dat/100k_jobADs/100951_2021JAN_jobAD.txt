Long-standing customers include SAP, FRAPORT, Hammerson plc and MSC Cruises. Favendo solutions are used and distributed by Kathrein SE, Trilux and Phoenix Contact.In the beginning we asked ourselves how to transfer the added value from eCommerce to stationary retail. The primary challenge was how to implement the product search, as known from Ebay, Amazon & Co., in stationary retail. This quickly developed into a fascination for searching, finding and tracking of goods and people in the real world at all.Today, our professional products are designed to help our clients find and locate things, people and places. We enable app users to do this search on their mobile phones and we enable organizations to find what they are looking for as efficiently as possible. We provide our clients with information on where to find what they are looking for and how to get there.Our success is based on our international team members’ skills, creativity and engagement. A competent staffed advisory council and huge market experience are providing support in strategic decision-making.Favendo is also proud partner of the Omlox Initiative.
