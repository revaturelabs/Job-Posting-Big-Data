When you’re considering a job offer, there’s more to think about than just how much you are going to be paid.Here are the ten things to check before taking up a job offer:a.) Role & criticality to businessCheck out if your role is interesting, and if it is crucial to the business. If it is both, then you have surely struck gold. The more critical role, the less are chances of you getting fired in bad times.b.) Financial health of the companyYou don't want to end up with a company which is going down financially and whose future looks flimsy. You may have to look for a job then which may be even more difficult.c.) Company's brand valueYour career prospects depend on how much industry value your employer has. A stint with a company below average market value will land you with similar companies in future.d.) Work culture and environmentAsk the interviewer about work practices, celebrations on events or how they pursue 'employee engagement'. Since this is one thing that can be visually exhibited around, your employer will most probably show off these through photos /videos on the website or during your interaction.e.) Salary, perquisites, designation and benefitsThis being the most direct result of your work, you should expect about 25% - 50% hike on your current salary package. Check out your tax implications and if the new salary structure helps in saving taxes, it is all the better.f.) Work-life balanceWill this assignment need you to make lifestyle changes (travel, commute, work timings) and are you prepared for it? If it undesirably alters your lifestyle to a big extent, you should give the offer a second thought.g.) Current team/bossAsk proactively about the current team, team leader/ boss, a typical work day in the team, and any good practices they follow. This will give you an idea about whether you'll like working in the team.h.) Company's growth and attrition rateAsk about company's growth straightway to the interviewer. The growth can be measured in terms of employee size, increase in revenue/ turnover/ profit. Getting to know about the attrition rate is equally important. You would not want to part of that figure in short term.i.) Learning and growth opportunitiesYour work experience of five years should not mean one year's experience repeated five times. Only good learning opportunities ensure exponential growth of your career.j.) Transnational opportunityJob seekers who are evaluating trans-national job opportunities should always do a thorough check on the location, compare the cost of living and evaluate career progression plans for the role, in case they want to come back home in the future.Add Comment()Comments ()Characters Remaining: 3000SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmailOR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATIONXSort By: NewestOldestDiscussedUp VotedDown VotedBe the first one to comment.We have sent you a verification email.
