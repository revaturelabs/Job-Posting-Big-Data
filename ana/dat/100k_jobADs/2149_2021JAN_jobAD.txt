Whether you're looking for an actual ministry or pastoral position in a church or just a regular job in a Christian-centered business, design your job search to put you in contact with sources of information about the specific job you're seeking. Start in your own church, expand to Christian charitable, counseling or volunteer organizations and include Christian schools and retails outlets to give you the broadest possible exposure to available job opportunities with a Christian emphasis.1Create a professional-looking resume that highlights your specific training, qualifications and experience for jobs in a Christian setting. Ensure you have both a hard copy and electronic version.2Talk to your mentors, your pastor or others who think highly of you and know you through your involvement in Christian activities. Ask each one for his permission to use him as a reference in your Christian job search.3Network with friends, neighbors or acquaintances who work in Christian businesses, churches or organizations. Let people know you are looking for a job in a setting that not only supports your Christian faith, but also one in which your faith is a requirement or qualification for the job. If you're looking for a specific type of job, such as youth minister, Christian counselor or a job in a Christian school or bookstore, tell them so and ask them to introduce you to people they know who might know of openings in those areas.4Volunteer in the church or organization of your choice to get experience and exposure. This gives you the opportunity to meet those in leadership positions or others who may know of Christian job opportunities in the area. Churches, for example, frequently start their job search internally, so you're more likely to hear of openings if you're part of the organization.5Take advantage of the services offered by the career office at your seminary or religious studies institution, if you are a current or former student. The personnel in these offices should be well-grounded in the best approaches to take to find a Christian or faith-based job and also may have a listing of available opportunities.6Visit Christian employment websites to get ideas of the types of jobs in your area and the required qualifications. According to Andy Rowell of Duke Divinity School, this is not the most effective route to take to find your dream job, but it might give you some basic information. Rowell states that most church- or ministry-related jobs are located through networking and word-of-mouth.ReferencesChurch Leadership Conversations: How to Search for a Christian Ministry JobMinistry Employment: Christian Job SearchChristian Personal Finance: How To Use Your Network To Find A JobResourcesChristianAnswers.net: Ministerial EmploymentWriter BioAs a national security analyst for the U.S. government, Molly Thompson wrote extensively for classified USG publications.
