You will work a Monday to Friday schedule-yet your impact on the lives of our patients will be felt every day.If you haven’t considered Nephrology nursing before, read on as we think that you should. Dialysis Experience is NOT required.What you can expect:Complexities - You multitask in myriad ways - put down one patient's chart, start another, work with a physician, run out to get a medication, respond to a supplier's request - with lots of loose ends to pull together and a lot of follow up. It's challenging, fun and keeps your day fresh.Educator - Empower your patients by teaching them to administer their own dialysis and to take their health back into their own hands. If you feel your calling has always been to be both a nurse and educator, then you will love your work as a peritoneal dialysis nurse. Training patients takes time and mental energy and the rewards of that investment come in seeing the transformation of your patients from feeling sick and afraid, to strong and independent.Autonomy - Provide comprehensive patient care in an independent setting. Plan to be on your toes at all times. You use your mind constantly. You apply your \"core\" nursing skills to assess, diagnose and implement complete care plans as you look at the whole patient. There's a lot to track and manage and the joy comes in witnessing how your care impacts patients' lives.What We’ll Provide:More than just pay, our DaVita Rewards package connects teammates to what matters most including:Comprehensive benefits: Medical, dental, vision, 401(k) match, paid time off, PTO cash outSupport for you and your family: family resources, EAP counseling sessions, access Headspace®, backup child and elder care, maternity/paternity leave and morePaid training: DaVita offers all new dialysis teammates a robust, paid training program to help you learn the right dialysis skills.
