She said: “We’d love to [do more marketing] but actually we are busy running the business.”Her advice to agencies was to acknowledge the fact that the CMO role is not just communications and that understanding the business will help them to work better with brand leaders. “Recognise that that is what our life is like and acknowledge it and you will be half way there,” said Metcalfe.The CEO doesn’t see agencies as the solution to the problemAt the same time as CMOs having less time to concentrate on working with agencies on communications, Kendrick highlighted another issue that clients don’t admit to – that CEO’s don’t look to agencies to solve business problems.CEOs do, however, look to analysts such as PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Bain, McKinsey and management consultants who are paid “an enormous amount of money”, according to Kendrick.She said: “I know a number of digital shops doing some very clever forward-facing stuff in data, producing answers that are broad business solutions, but the CEO is just not seeing it that way.”Whether it’s a perception issue or reality “the fact is that [agencies] are not getting to the most senior leaders in companies”, she added.Metcalfe waded in with advice for agencies while criticising the use of analysts. She said: “The reality is the PwC, McKinsey’s and the Bain’s come at business issue with logic rather than creative thinking. They don’t get the customer and they don’t get human motivations.”She told the agencies in the audience to partner with these companies to get into the board room and added that as CMO’s they “hate it when our CEO brings in PwC to sort out our data and analytics [when agencies] know more about that then PwC do”.The advice was to “come in on the back of their coattails and partner with them, and solve problems for us together”.Related linksWhy CMOs have ‘very little time’ to do marketing This will open in a new windowEmail thisFacebookTwitterLinkedInPinterestRedditBack to listingBack to topAbout UsContact UsWebsite Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyMobile AppFacebookTwitter© 2011 - 2021 Centaur Media Plc.
