She was looking for 10 to 15 people to drive water trucks, or, as they’re known in the industry, “water bottles.”The job pays $19 to $21 per hour, with 12-hour shifts, five days a week.The challenge Powell faces is getting applicants with the right experience — including a tanker endorsement, clean driving record and two years of experience. “We need to get more people to work for us,” she said.Falcon Drilling is another company working with Range, specializing in vertical drilling for wells.“It’s physical labour,” human resources manager Rachel Himes told the Dispatch. “You’re constantly moving and out in the elements.” Work is 14 days on, then 14 days off.But, she said, “the pay is great.” With no experience or education, someone can be making up to $59,000 a year, plus benefits.“I’m always hoping to find anybody, at any time,” she said. “It’s tough to fill the positions. It’s hard to find quality people.”Share:Find amazing USA Oil & Gas job leads here.
