Please do not apply.\\nSUMMARY\\n\\nCome join our team responsible for building out 50 POPs and 20 Terabits per Second of global network capacity!\\n\\nFastly is looking for a Director of Hardware Systems Engineering to join our Infrastructure Team. This role is responsible for Fastly‚Äôs overall hardware architecture vision, strategy, and roadmap. As Director of Hardware Systems Engineering you will be required to recruit, hire, and retain a top notch, globally distributed team of infrastructure architects and test/lab engineers. Expect that your team will be presented with unreleased hardware for testing, evaluation, and integration into our stack. Know in advance that there will be many unknowns, most often a lack of documentation and drivers, but that is OK because such situations excite you. In this role, you will be expected to latch onto complex problems and drive the team towards success.\\n\\nYour team of architects are people who are comfortable laying out a datacenter, building up rack elevations, and know the three-phase power equation. They are comfortable picking the right Intel Scalable Xeon Processor to replace the current line of E5-2697v4s in use today. And they will ruthlessly reason about DIMM power density and heat output versus cooling fan velocity. They will aggressively complain about poor driver implementations and then make suggestions on how to improve them. They will debate the merits of using CDWM passive multiplexing systems for short haul 10GE extensions over the aggregation services into 100GE circuits because colored lasers are neat.\\n\\nYou are responsible for organizing cross functional hardware projects at Fastly because we all know high performing hardware needs deep software integration. You‚Äôll integrate with leaders in our kernel, driver, and caching teams to help ensure efficient use of our hardware. As Director you will bring harmony to the chaos of the hardware supply chain. You‚Äôll work to ensure seamless technical integrations with Fastly‚Äôs stack while ensuring upstream availability of goods from manufacturers. You should have a mind for the business details so that you know when you are paying too much for NAND.\\n\\nRESPONSIBILITIES\\n\\n\\n* Recruits, retains, and manages globally distributed infrastructure architects and hardware systems engineers.\\n\\n* Develops and iterates on system hardware strategies to optimize for performance and cost.\\n\\n* Engages with key supply chain partners to understand roadmaps, future product release, and long term strategic benefits to Fastly.\\n\\n* Works with business functions (finance, legal, and compliance) to ensure objectives on budget, risk, and compliance are adhered to and met.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPRIOR EXPERIENCE\\n\\n\\n* Prior leadership experience in engineering, systems, and/or IT.\\n\\n* 5+ years of direct experience designing large server environments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQUALIFICATIONS\\n\\n\\n* B.S. level credentials in Engineering and/or Computer Science.\\n\\n* Must be a capable leader with experience in running distributed teams.\\n\\n* Must be a strong communicator, verbally and in documentation.\\n\\n* Capable of designing metrics, iterating on measurement, and driving change.\\n\\n* Comfortable with Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, bonus for any of SQL, R, Python.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFastly provides equal employment opportunity without regard to an applicant‚Äôs race, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic information, national origin, age, physical or mental disability, medical condition, religion, marital status or veteran status. \\n\\nApplicants with disabilities may be entitled to reasonable accommodation under the terms of the Americans with Disabilities Act and certain state or local laws.
