With a plan to host a virtual chat to help jobseekers to move forward during the pandemic, Christine Cristiano of Ideal Career Services, Maureen McCann of Promotion Career Solutions, and Michelle Precourt of Mindful HR Services answered Daisy’s call and jumped at the chance to support this worthwhile initiative.At the completion of the 7 weeks, the idea of compiling all the questions and answers that emerged during the online chats was hatched and the collaborative creation of the eBook, “Clarity in the Time of Chaos; 25 Questions Jobseekers Asked Career Professionals,” was born.This book is a selection of the top 25 questions that were asked by jobseekers along with the answers provided by the career professional panelists. Thanks to fellow career professional, Sweta Regmi who also lent her expertise and perspective to the sessions.Download the ebook today and share it with your network!DownloadIf you are in need of personalized 1-1 career coaching to navigate the job market and jumpstart your job search or career transition, call Ideal Career Services at 647-361-9916 and let’s chat!This entry was posted in Career Advice and tagged Career Advice, career professional, clarity in the time of chaos, ebook, how to do a job interview, how to find a job, job interview tips, jobseekers, resume writing on August 10, 2020 by camc95.
