Estimators may travel to worksites, read blueprints and technical documents, collaborate with engineers and other high-level personnel, or consult construction experts in order to gather data regarding materials, labor, and time needed to complete the project. They analyze this information to calculate reasonable cost-effective budgets and probable project timelines. Strong computer skills are important, as most estimates are determined using programs.Estimators produce output for several purposes.
