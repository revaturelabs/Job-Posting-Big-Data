Machadocame for a visit and we sat on theend of the bridge, which was his idea.Now that I‚Äôm old the work goes slowly.Ever nearer death, I like it out herehigh above the sea bundledup for the arctic storms of late fall,the resounding crash and moan of the sea,the hundred-foot depth of the green troughs.Sometimes the sea roars and howls likethe animal it is, a continent wide and alive.What beauty in this the darkest musicover which you can hear the lightest music of humanbehavior, the tender connection between men and galaxies.So I sit on the edge, wagging my feet abovethe abyss. Tonight the moon will be in my lap.This is my job, to study the universefrom my bridge. I have the sky, the sea, the faintgreen streak of Canadian forest on the far shore.‚ÄúBridge‚Äù by Jim Harrison from Dead Man‚Äôs Floati‚Äôve read this poem many times over and find it more beautiful each time. it‚Äôs from writer‚Äôs almanac. maybe you would like to read it aloud to yourself, or your cat tonight. i don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶i love this line: What beauty in this the darkest music over which you can hear the lightest music of human behavior, the tender connection between men and galaxies.in the world of school, i have found myself back in chinatown. subbing for now. i start in a transitional kindergarten class on monday. 4 year olds.OHDEARsome pics from today‚Äôs assignment in a kinder class.stay tuned for stories from the trenches. it‚Äôs possible i will live to tell them. but for now i will sit here on my bridge and study the universe.goodnight from the city of angels‚Ä¶¬´ PreviousNext ¬ªFiled Under: A POEMSubscribe to Blog via EmailEnter your email address below to subscribe to Dispatch From LA.

Catching up with your blog posts from the past few days. Re: Sept 3‚Ä¶.sounds like you‚Äôre doing all the right things with the tiny tots. I taught prek for several years and loved it. Legos and paint and singing and blocks and make believe, what fun.And Concordia , Kansas! that‚Äôs where my grandma and grandpa met (roller skating) and married before moving out west.Vicki Gelberg says	August 31, 2016 at 9:11 pmAnd on top of it all you speak and write Mandarin? You are deeply gifted.Mary Ann Moss says	September 5, 2016 at 2:41 pmi was subbing in that classroomSabrina says	August 26, 2016 at 12:15 amI love your pictures of the stormy sea. Waves crashing, water in the air, wind blowing hard around you. I love that! Going to the shore tomorrow for a day only, in calm, hot sunny weather, but better than not going at all!Looking at your Umbria travel journal and thinking about all the people there who lost their life, their home, their loved ones‚Ä¶Good luck with your kids! Can‚Äôt wait to hear about them!Mary Ann Moss says	August 26, 2016 at 6:35 amthe amatrice quake so so so tragic‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs difficult to take it all in ‚Äì a loss of over 250 people. people who lived their ordinary lives there, but also those who had traveled there for a vacation. üôÅthe sea photos are from the sonoma coast in winter ‚Äì a lovely part of northern californiaJane S. says	August 25, 2016 at 6:29 pmWe all need ‚Äúrug rules‚Äù. Ha, ha. This is so cute. The ocean calls to me, too; but, alas, I am so very far away from it. Sigh.Linda Watson says	August 25, 2016 at 6:14 pmSo it will be from the bridge to the rug, and maybe learning Chinese, a language I understand much less than the talk of the ocean. Good that you have that bridge waiting for you.Mary Ann Moss says	August 25, 2016 at 7:18 pmmy class will be english‚Ä¶but will prob have some portion that will not be proficient. giant bridge will be constructed 1st day‚Ä¶:-)Carol K says	August 25, 2016 at 2:15 pmThe poem is beautiful, simply beautiful. Thank you for sharing. Love the class photos! Remember, you‚Äôre the monkey wrangler.Susie LaFond says	August 25, 2016 at 9:47 amAwesome poem Mary Ann. It will be going into a journal. That reminds me I just finished making another journal via FTB. Still one of my favorite classes EVER. I will shoot you a pic through the wires. For now I promise to raise my hand and I will sit very quietly on my rug. I promise to follow all of the rules too. üòâElizabeth Woodford says	August 25, 2016 at 6:09 amIt appears that nightly bridge sitting will be necessary!! THinking of you and sending you good sleep when you can get it, tons of energy and delight in watching your little ones flower! They are so lucky to have you!! Trip planned yet????Paula West says	August 25, 2016 at 5:06 amI‚Äôve enjoyed your blog for a few weeks now and really enjoy it.I‚Äôve especially enjoyed your posts about your Swedish trip. Makes me want to go!I‚Äôm retired after 35 years of teaching primary.If you are looking for VERY special read alouds ( chapter length )‚Äômay I spread the wealth? The One and Only Ivan, Wainscott Weasel, The Wild Robot, and Elmer and the Dragon. Forgive missing underline.You might pre read to be sure. You will love these books.isabelledj says	August 25, 2016 at 2:53 amOh thank you for the poem and photos ‚Äì a very famous langage teacher told me that if i would learn chinese, i had to learn from another langage than my own ‚Ä¶ So, i am starting with your kids !!!! to pay for my lesson, i can tell you chinese people believe in sharing and good luck. So, i suggest you to try this :‚Äì pick up wine leaves ‚Äì red could be more terrific ‚Äì and glue each on a solid paper, yhe tail of the top sheet. Than, with a black pencil, draw a circle for the head and two tiny triangles for ears/ Put google looking ‚Äúeyes‚Äù and a smile on the face you now got.‚Äì Return the paper and imagine the leaves are wings. You will draw hooks downside for paws and do not forget to draw the tree where your bat is hanging, the head upside down.No better lucky charm for chinese people. It sounds ‚Äúmoney‚Äù to they ears ‚Ä¶ there is just a little problemo : kids won‚Äôt let you go ‚Ä¶jan says	August 24, 2016 at 11:16 pmyou are teaching 4 YEAR OLDS???!!!
