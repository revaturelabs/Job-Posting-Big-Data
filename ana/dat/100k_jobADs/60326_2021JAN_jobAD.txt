For the quarter, postings for HR jobs grew by 11 percent.Although Indeed doesn’t track the specific HR jobs being advertised, keyword searches are counted, and the most popular keyword used by job seekers is “human resources.” During April, there were 695,000 searches using that term.Article Continues Below“Recruiter” was the distant second most popular search, with 108,000 searches.Competition for jobs in New York was greatest. There were 209,000 clicks into HR job listings in New York, followed by jobs in Atlanta, which had 122,000 clicks. Because Indeed sends job seekers to the site where the job posting originated, there’s no way of telling from the data how many of those clicks resulted in applications.TweetShareShareJohn Zappe	John Zappe is the editor of TLNT.com and a contributing editor of ERE.net.
