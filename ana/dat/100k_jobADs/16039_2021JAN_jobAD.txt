"Top 10 PHX Coffee ShopsWho?PortfolioBlogThe Basic Bible CourseNew ProjectMenuWho?PortfolioBlogThe Basic Bible CourseNew ProjectTop 10 PHX Coffee ShopsNovember 9, 2017	3:00 pm	@thehenryrestaurantI’ve always wanted to write a travel guide and nows my chance. With graduation right around the corner, I decided to write a post including my favorite Phoenix coffee shops to hang out in. Literally, there are so many options and I didn’t even include all of the shops I’ve been to. We are a city of innovators and entreprenuers so this shouldn’t come as a suprise that all of these are local shops. These aren’t in any order EXCEPT my top three are numbered but you have to scroll down for those!Chai Wednesday.A post shared by be Coffee + Food + Stuff (@be_coffeephx) on Oct 11, 2017 at 12:17pm PDTBe coffee + food + stuffAddress: 214 E. Roosevelt Street, Phoenix, AZ 85004Coffee, breakfast, sandwiches and more this space has a fun environment! Plus you can go outside and take a picture at the overly insta’s bird wall. Oh and can’t forget the little shop in the same building called the Bosque that sells plants. Green everywhere.We couldn't help but choose this fluffy cutie 🐶 as this week's #FollowTheArrow winner!

Join us for a @pizzaportbrewingco tie-dye party tonight from 6-8pm! Coffee now, beer later 😏 . . #FridayMood #TapTakeover #PizzaPort #TieDyeParty #SipCoffeeAndBeer #CoffeeAndBeerGarage #SIPportLocal #Arcadia #localwateringhole #MoreCaffeinePlease #IcedLatte #fridaynightfunA post shared by Sip Coffee & Beer Garage (@sipcoffeeandbeergarage) on Nov 3, 2017 at 5:16am PDTSip Coffee Beer GarageAddress: 3620 E Indian School Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85018“A while back an old auto oil shop closed its doors. We had a different idea – Sip Coffee & Beer Garage. The second extension to our local coffee and beer locations in the valley. This old garage is now one of the most popular destinations in Phoenix for specialty coffee, craft beer and a locally sourced food menu.” This one is fun definitely a more rough vibe but has huge tables for gathering many people!Sometimes you need to put your feet up.A post shared by Songbird Coffee & Tea House ☕ (@songbirdcoffeehouse) on Aug 29, 2017 at 10:37am PDTSong Bird Coffee & TeaAddress: 812 N. 3rd Street, Phoenix, AZ 85004“While our focus is coffee and tea, you will love our house-made pastries and light foods. Vegan pastries, enjoyed by all, are delivered from the lovely ladies at Treehouse Bakery (less than 2 miles away).” Song Bird is in a little house off the main street in downtown Phoenix. It’s on the smaller size but still fun + it has a porch swing for when you need to take a break!\"don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds you plant.\" —robert louis stevenson 🌴💙☕️ _ giant coffee | phoenix, azA post shared by brit held (@bheld) on Sep 6, 2017 at 6:19am PDTGiant CoffeeAddress: 1437 N 1st St, Phoenix, AZ 85004“Funky hangout serving java blends & light fare in a loungelike atmosphere with rustic tables.” Okay my only complaint is their isn’t much seating so their name is rather controversial. Wall art in the back is definitely worth a photoshoot though!A post shared by Lux Central (@luxcentral) on Oct 7, 2017 at 6:20am PDTLux CentralAddress: 4402 N Central Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85012:“Rustic cafe & bakery serving an eclectic, ever-changing menu plus coffee, wine, beer & cocktails.” Can’t pass up Lux. This place is always hopping, has free postcards, is open late hours and sells the BEST mac & cheese.Fact: First Street construction sucks. BUT in the long run it will be great, AND there are many ways to get to DeSoto — show your LIGHT RAIL pass for 10% off! You can also ride a @gridbikes or walk with a friend and get some exercise. 💪🚲🚉 #desotocentralmarket Photo credit: @downtownphoenixA post shared by DeSoto Central Market (@desotocentralmarket) on Sep 14, 2017 at 12:00pm PDTDeSoto Central Market“Hipster hangout offering eateries, a bar & a farmer’s market in a vintage warehouse space.” This is more of a building not a coffee shop but it is super fun and there are many options for food and drinks! Good place to go to write those three essays due tonight.& Now for My top Three…..Thankful to have a friend who accommodates me as I prepare for my first life group of the year!!A post shared by Charity Kolbo (@charitylikesbeards) on Aug 24, 2015 at 6:09pm PDT3. The RefugeAddress: 4170 E Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Clarkston, GA 30021The proceeds from this daytime coffee shop & nightime wine bar funds local nonprofits! If you are looking for a place to eat & enjoy chill vibes, this is your place! I always love supporting places that support awesome causes. It helps me justify the two teas.CoffeeA post shared by Vanessa Ontiveros (@vahkeykey) on Oct 31, 2017 at 9:27am PDT2. Fair TradeAddress: 1020 N 1st Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85003“Fair Trade Cafe has two locations in downtown Phoenix Arizona where we serve fair trade coffee, and offer an assortment of in house bakery items as well as sandwiches and breakfast items. Come study, or visit us during our weekly poetry slams, or to check out our local art gallery!” I really love this place. With tons of art on the walls and wood vibes everywhere you can’t go wrong. Plus everything is what it sounds like, fair traded. They call it “Coffee with a Conscience!”Not ready for Monday 😩 but at least there's Copper Star! #copperstarcoffeeA post shared by Copper Star Coffee (@copperstarcoffee) on Sep 10, 2017 at 6:42pm PDT1. Copper Star CoffeeAddress: 4220 N 7th Ave in Phoenix, Arizona“Trendy stop for locally roasted coffee & sandwiches in a renovated gas station with a drive-thru.” Okay I can’t help it, this one is my favorite. It has a smaller less busy atmosphere. It’s a little rough around the edges but I always get a fresh bagel sandwich and refills are super cheap!These are all my favorite coffee shops and trust me, there are so many more here in PHX. We really love our local coffee shops. Let me know which one is your favorite in the comments below!AshleyShare on facebookFacebook	Share on googleGoogle+	Share on twitterTwitter	Share on linkedinLinkedIn	This error message is only visible to WordPress adminsError: No posts found.Make sure this account has posts available on instagram.com.Who?PortfolioBlogThe Basic Bible CourseNew ProjectMenuWho?PortfolioBlogThe Basic Bible CourseNew ProjectSearchFacebook-fInstagramPinterest© 2019 All rights reservedTemplate by created Co studios"
