You will not be able to use your account from abroad. Generally you need to open a bank in person. It can be difficult to do so from abroad.The SituationTo open a bank account in Ireland you generally need two things. One is identification, you can use your passport. The second is proof of address. They usually ask for a bill but if you have just arrived you won’t have any bills in your name. However, you are able to use correspondence from a local authority such as Revenue (Tax). When you register for tax with Revenue (after you get your PPS number) you are able to use the letters you receive as proof of address.Registering with RevenueA pps number is a unique id each person has so they can be easily identified when using services by public companies eg Revenue. You can only request a PPS number when you can prove you need to make a transaction with a specific public company. Looking for a job does not qualify as a transaction. When you have accepted a job offer then you should apply for a PPS number as you need to make a transaction with Revenue to get your tax credits.When you have a pps number you can register for an account on Revenue.ie. They will send you a pin in the post. When you have registered you will need to request your tax credits. This document will tell your employer how much tax they need to take from your salary and pay to Revenue. Your tax credits certificate is an official document which will have your address and can be used as proof of address when opening a bank account.Things to noteYou do not need a PPS number to search for a job or accommodation. Employers should not request your PPS number until you have accepted a job offer. Also, landlords should not request your PPS number until you have accepted an offer of accommodation. Landlords will need your PPS number to register you with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.TAGSopen bank accountFacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsAppPrevious articleWe are looking for InternshipsNext articleHow to get a working visa in IrelanddubjobsRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORNew Student Accommodation Service – dubroomsLEAVE A REPLY Cancel replyLog in to leave a commentPremium ContentAdvice from an Entrepreneur on finding a jobdubjobs - 6th January 2021 0Sean start a marketing company recently.
