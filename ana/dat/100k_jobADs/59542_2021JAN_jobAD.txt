I joined at the start of December 2015 and have been offered enough work to fit around my own needs and other commitments. The work has been varied and I received good information prior to the visit. The excellent dedicated back office support staff and they clearly understand their clients’ needs which are aligned to the qualities of the Support Workers, this helps builds the relationship.While there is a need for help at short notice to meet the company needs I have been further impressed to have good notice of most of the work intended. My role has been largely Community Support but I have worked with our Residential team and clearly there is plentiful work again with helpful support.In my dealings with the company I have found the ENS team to be helpful and approachable and need to reiterate how impressed I have been. Thank you to all involved.GraemeA big thank you to you and all of the booking team that have put up with me over the months and helped me get an amazing full time job, Thank you :)RDMaria Meddle (ENS Senior Recruitment & Compliance Officer), I would like to use this opportunity to say a big thank you for taking your good time in dealing with my application. Thank you Maria once again for helping me get out of unemployment, I sincerely appreciate all the effort and support you gave me during this period.NA98 Hamlet Court RoadWestcliff on SeaEssex, SS0 7LP01702 353100info@ensgroup.co.ukBeyond StandardsNavigationHomeJob searchCandidatesClientsAbout usNewsContactCandidatesCandidates overviewTemporary WorkPermanent WorkClientsClients overviewWhy ENS?Workforce Management SolutionsClient TestimonialsTrainingDownload DocumentsTerms & ConditionsENS Group Privacy PoliciesSitemapENS Health & Social Care is a part of the ENS GroupCare & SupportCommercial RecruitmentTrainingcopyright © 2021 ENS Recruitment Ltd | Website Built By: Revive.Digital"
