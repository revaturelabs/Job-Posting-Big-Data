He had probably reached level 4 and I was still on level 1. In order to catch up, I decided to publish this job posting so I could employ someone to catch Pokemon; it wasn’t a joke,” said Kashyap.The job posting saw close to 60 applications within a few days of the advertisement, with six coming from overseas individuals.“Most of the applicants were gamers, even potential hackers. We are looking to hire someone who has reached a high level, for instance, level five within 48 hours, and obviously sends us proof of this as a screenshot where we can see their game board details,” Kashyap said.The employer on the site, which would actually be Kashyap, has been listed as Ash Ketchum, the renowned Pokemon trainer. The criteria for applying include thorough knowledge of the database, physically fitness and dexterity at catching Pokemon, the virtual monsters often described as cute.Pokemon GO, the augmented reality game on smartphones, has not been formally launched in India and hence can’t be accessed through Google Play Store. Most people in the country — who are playing the game — have download its APK from other online portals.“Ideally, someone who is likely to get this job could be a gamer or a professional who can probably work part-time during the evenings and the weekends. Right now, it’s on hold since the game isn’t working, but we will short-list and select candidates once the game launches in India,” said Blagsvedt.According to Kashyap, some Pokemon GO players have been selling their log-in details for up to $100 to new users who can then start from a higher level, indicating that profits from the game are not restricted to only Niantic Labs, the developers of Pokemon GO.“It’s likely that the game will formally launch in India within a month. It makes sense now while the game is gaining momentum to capitalise upon it and move quickly,” said Kashyap.Read More News ongamingPikachuNiantic LabsBabajobPokemon GoVir KashyapAdd CommentTweets About ETtechMost Reads from TechJoe Biden's 'overhaul' of US immigration policy to help Indians in Green Card queueTCS building a future-ready 'talent cloud'Tesla India books one-seat office in Awfis BengaluruIndigo Paints IPO: Sequoia gains, Zerodha fumblesUsers complain of Zerodha outage as Indigo Paints IPO opensTandav Controversy: Govt seeks explanation from Amazon Prime VideoTata closes in on BigBasket, 1mg to power super app planCovid-19 forced Big 4 Indian IT firms to step up hiring in Q3PM Narendra Modi announces Rs 1,000-crore 'Startup India Seed Fund'Scoop: Wingreens Farms acquires Raw Pressery at a fifth of its 2018 valuationInstacart to lay off shoppers in shift to pick-up ordersFacing backlash, WhatsApp to delay new privacy policy by three monthsWill Jack Ma's disappearance break Vijay Shekhar Sharma's back?Google says it will shut search engine in Australia if forced to pay for newsMessaging app Signal faces global outage days after adding millions of usersBrowseCompanies:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456789Trending NowJioBudget Live newsBitcoinRanjan GogoiFarmers protest Live newsKamala HarrisSharad PawarLarge cap funds 2021What is a Green cardWhat is ab F-1 visaWhat is an H-1b visaBest gilt mutual fundsBest ELSS fundsBest mid cap funds 2021What are debt mutual fundsAadhaar card guideWhat is a long duration debt fundPopular CategoriesNews Live!Markets Live !Stock ScreenerMF ScreenerCandlestick ScreenerSunday ETCovid UpdatesUS ElectionsET500Hot on WebUnion budget Live updatesKamala HarrisFarmers protest latest updatesDonald TrumpWhat is F-1 visaSensex todayBudget 2021What are multi asset fundsWhat are balanced mutual fundsGlobal marketsMutual fundsBreaking newsYES Bank share priceSGX NiftySensex LiveIRCTC share priceInfosys share priceIn Case you missed itDonald TrumpMamata BanerjeeSonia GandhiBudget 2021 Live newsBudget dateBoris JohnsonFarmers protest Live updatesFATFGSTFranklin TempletonLarge & mid cap funds 2021B1 visaBest aggressive hybrid funds 2021HDFC balanced advantage fundMutual fundsHow to check CIBIL scoreIncome Tax slabsET VerticalsAuto NewsRetail NewsHealth NewsTelecom NewsEnergy NewsIT NewsReal Estate NewsMarketing & Advertising NewsTechnology NewsCFO NewsIT Security NewsMore from our networkइकनॉमिक टाइम्सPune MirrorBangalore MirrorAhmedabad MirrorItsMyAscentEducation TimesBrand CapitalMumbai MirrorTimes NowIndiatimesमहाराष्ट्र टाइम्ವಿಜಯ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕGo GreenAdAge IndiaEisamayIGN IndiaIamGujaratTimes of IndiaSamayam TamilSamayam TeluguMiss KyraBombay TimesFilmipopMX PlayerNewspaper SubscriptionTimes PrimeColombiaNBT Gold PodcastEi Samay Gold PodcastMX ShareKaro AppMX TakaTak AppOther useful LinksAbout UsSubscribe to ET PrimeBook your Newspaper SubscriptionCall 1800 1200 004 (Toll Free)Create Your Own AdAdvertise with UsTerms of Use & Grievance RedressalPrivacy policyContact UsCompany Name: Times Internet LimitedRegistered Office Address: 9-10,Bahardurshah Zafar Marg, New Delhi - 110002Corporate Identity Number: U74999DL1999PLC135531Grievance Officer: Deepak AjwaniEmail: grievance.et@timesinternet.inRSSDNPA Code of EthicsservicesLongwalks AppFollow us on:Download ET App:subscribe to our newsletterCopyright © 2021 Bennett, Coleman & Co.
