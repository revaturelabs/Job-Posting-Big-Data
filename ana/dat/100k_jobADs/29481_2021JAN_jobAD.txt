Its benefits have evolved into providing relaxation, promoting sleep and alleviating or completely eliminating specific body ailments. While specific forms of massage vary, the most common are: Swedish, Trigger Point, Deep Tissue, Sport and Shiatsu. Through speaking with a client and discussing their medical history, the Therapist is able to determine what form of massage will be most beneficial. A job as a massage therapist allows you immense flexibility, not only in your work schedule, but environment as well. Some choose to work in spas, while others travel to offices and homes offering their services. Tired of a low-paying desk job and looking to become everyone’s favorite indulgence?
