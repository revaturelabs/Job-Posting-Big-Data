After they do their first audition, the judges (Simon Cowell, Nicole Scherzinger and Leona Lewis) decide if you are a group artist or a solo singer. If you get put thru to the next round, that's when the judges decide if you are in the group or not. Then when the girl group and the boy group have been decided, they go against each other to see which group is the best!Wish you luck in your future xx-Fellow EarthlingFellow Earthling (02907)401 days agoAlso merry Christmas for 6 days xxüíñüíùüéÅFellow Earthling (02907)401 days agoI'm no dancer but I am an amazing singer and a great actor and writer (this is what my friends have told me.) I play the violin (about to do grade 2) and I am quite good on the keyboard and ukulele. I am OK at drums and guitar. Me and my brother are both really musical. I'm not sure what I want to be when I'm older. I was thinking of being an actress but then I discovered that I am good at singing and writing. I am (hopefully) going to go on the X Factor when I am old enough. If I earn enough money, I will donate some of it to charities including the charity/group that my BFF wants to make which will protect endangered animals, try and stop ppl from littering and try and stop ppl from using single use plastic. I have a good feeling about our futures and I hope it doesnt go wrong.To anyone out there with a dream as big as ours, you can achieve it if you put your mind to it.Sending everyone love and hope üíñüíùüéÅ-Fellow EarthlingMarina (08293)442 days agoI like to write music, sing, and dance but i have not shared it with anyone aBea (42788)602 days agoI love musicals and got my first lead in matilda but now my dream role is crutchie in the newsies, milo in imaginary, eponine in les mis, Robertson ay in marry poppins, skimble in cats race in the newsies and lesser stoat or mole in wind in the willows.Mynameisjeff (42788)602 days agoThis was a fun quiz but not correct.

I wanted to dance like him, sing like him, have videos like him... I even wanted to kiss him! Anyway, one day in the future, I know I will be able to pursue my lifelong dream with time, effort, and practice. Michael had created my love for these arts, strengthened it, and showed me how to do it. All I have I owe him.Bethany (88849)790 days agoI don't know if it was helpful or not.

I love it when my friends come round to my house. Thats when we go into the back yard and make up routines to the latest songs. Then when we have completely finished the dance, we go to school and we perform it. We performed in front of my crush and he said we were fantastically fabulous.So everyone who actually bothered to read this always remember to follow your dreams and someday, they may come true.Ashley (37668)951 days agoI wish to be an idol singer and debut with a girl group it has been my dreams since I was 9 I'm working hard I made a lot of progress in singing and dancing now I just need to audition somewhere I hope someone would accept me.
