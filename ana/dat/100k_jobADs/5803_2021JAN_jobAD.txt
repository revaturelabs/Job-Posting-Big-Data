The research will be the focused on modern problems of Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics including topological states of matter, Weyl semimetals, quantum transport, unconventional superconductivity, electron hydrodynamics and quantum anomalies. The position will be funded as a part of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 1170 'ToCoTronics'.The Postdoctoral appointments will be for a period of two years with the possibility of extension to a third year upon positive evaluation. We are searching for highly motivated candidates with a strong background and expertise in theoretical condensed matter physics including but not limited to quantum transport in topological materials and electron hydrodynamics. The salary level is determined according to the German public service pay scale TVÃD E13. For Ph.D. students, the average time of employment is 3+1 years, and the salary is half of TVÃD E13. Female candidates are encouraged to apply.Theoretical Physics IV (Prof. Hankiewiczâs group) at Julius-Maximilians-University WÃ¼rzburg is internationally known for its research in theoretical condensed matter physics including spintronics, quantum magnetism, superconductivity and quantum transport in topological materials. Moreover, it provides a stimulating international research environment with numerous scientific visitors each year, as well as by organizing workshops and conferences in areas relevant to this position. Moreover, the SFB 1170 allows for close collaboration with the theoretical as well as experimental condensed matter physics groups at Julius-Maximilians-University WÃ¼rzburg.
