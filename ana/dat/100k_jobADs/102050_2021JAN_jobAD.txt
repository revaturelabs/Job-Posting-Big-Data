It is the color of the bright days of early summer, and as the sun high in the sky lights up the landscape, its yellow color ray brings us the power of enlightenment, lighting up the landscape of our search for knowledge. It is the color of the summer solstice ushering in the bright time of long days, warm temperatures, and sustained vigor. It is the color of midday, midyear, and the beginnings of midlife. Yellow is a color of journeys beginning well, full of promise and sunny optimism.Use Yellow CrystalsYellow Crystals Bring You Enlightenment, Optimism, Warmth, and ClarityIn lighter shades, yellow crystals, such as citrine, are useful for keeping awareness of important things, when day-to-day life can lead to forgetfulness.

Seeker Transformers are talismans used when the desire is to find a way to transform a part of one's life to a more desirable state. Seekers are used when we need some help to find a new path, a new approach, or in any quest to gain that which we desire but do not yet possess. When they possess the Earth Power of the Transformer, they form crystals that are excellent for seeking new capabilities that will transform some part of our life. Yellow crystals, such as Lemon Aura Quartz, are used for new efforts, new beginnings, and new projects when the objective is not necessarily the growth of something physical. This is perfect for interviewing for a new job. Lemon Aura Quartz also give you the power to solidify new interests and new relationships.

They help you wake things up and add zest, optimism, and meaning to your life and relationships.CitrineNatural Citrine's radiant yellow and gold energy activates, opens, and energizes the Solar Plexus and Sacral Chakras, directing personal power, creativity, and intelligent decisiveness to enhance the physical body.Lemon Aura QuartzWith its Earth Energy, Lemon Aura is the energy of stability, patience, honesty, balance, and resourcefulness.
