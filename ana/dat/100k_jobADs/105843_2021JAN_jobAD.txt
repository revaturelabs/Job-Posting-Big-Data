There aren't any limits in regard to what the script is - PHP, Bash, Perl, etc., what it can do, or what exactly the file extension should be. Examples are mailing an everyday report with all the user activity on a given site, creating a routine backup or erasing the content within a particular folder. These kinds of tasks or any other script can be run on intervals picked by the end user - every few minutes, hours or days, and even once a month as well as once a year depending on the exact intent. Working with cron jobs to improve numerous aspects of administrating a site saves considerable time and efforts.	Cron Jobs in Shared Website Hosting	The Hepsia Control Panel, that comes with all of the shared website hosting plans, will allow you to create cron jobs in a few basic steps even when you have never used this type of function previously. When you log in and proceed to the Cron Jobs section where you are able to set background tasks, you just have to paste the server access path to Perl, PHP or Python depending on the script you'll execute, type the path inside of your account for the specific script file and then choose how often the cron job has to be executed. For the latter, you can use the standard mode and choose the minutes, hours, days, etc. using uncomplicated drop-down navigation, or in case you are more skilled, you can take full advantage of the advanced mode and set the time period with numbers and asterisks i.e. the typical method that you may have used with various Control Panels.
