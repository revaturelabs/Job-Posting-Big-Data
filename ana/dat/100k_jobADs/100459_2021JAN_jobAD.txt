Being able to visualize your milestones and remaining action items on paper, often will allow you to see the progress you are making and provide a realization that you have a longer completed list of job search activities that you can be proud of.Along with a fresh cup of “Morning Joe,” getting your day started off with expressions of gratitude can help set the tone, rhythm, and energy for your daily outlook.Whether you are job searching, employed, or contemplating a career change altogether, staying positive and appreciating the small wins may give you that extra boost to keep you fully present in your career search.Getting started with a professional resume can yield big returns for your career.
