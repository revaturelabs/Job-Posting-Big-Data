Originally launched as OnePlus 3, the 3T variant followed later after a couple of months and to everyone’s surprise, it turned out to be a worthy upgrade after all. Now, after all this time, instead of launching the next smartphone in the series, the company has now decided to refresh the existing smartphone. But how would you refresh something that has already been upgraded once and relaunched? A new custom paint job! That’s the decision that came from within the doors at OnePlus and well, we must say, the new Colette Edition or the more standard variant for the consumers, the Midnight Black variant is an eye-candy.It all about colors this year right? From Matte Black to Red phones, manufacturers are thinking out of the box and are coming up with more options for the consumers and on the same lines, OnePlus’s decision of bringing a Matte Black OnePlus 3T is arguably the best decision ever. Photos cannot do the justice here in showing how beautiful this new color looks. It builds upon the existing sleek design of the OnePlus 3T and makes it pops out. It is just a thin slab of Black metal that manages to stay stealthy at any given lighting and conditions. If you are using one of this outside, then you better be ready as you are certainly going to turn some heads.Also, OnePlus’s decision of not leaving the Black as a Colette exclusive is also something to be appreciated since the Colette Edition is not the easiest thing to get your hands unless you are planning on packing your bags and go out on a vacation to buy a smartphone. Having said that, by no means we are saying that one should just buy this variant and forget about the rest of the color options. And since we are not getting other than a new paint here for the extra premium price, although this is not a must have but is certainly worth your time and we urge you to walk into a OnePlus Experience store and check it out once. We are leaving a couple of photos of the smartphone down below for you to take a look at before you go ahead and buy it.Now that you have seen the device in all it’s glory, we would like to know what do you think about this? Would you be interested in buying this or do you think it is not really worth the price? Be sure to let us know what do you think about this and also stay tuned to PhoneRadar for more info like this.Comment what you thinkRelated Topics:Up NextRefurbished Samsung Galaxy Note 7R to Feature Smaller 3,200mAh BatteryDon't MissWhatsApp messenger is soon going to support Digital Payments in IndiaAdvertisementYou may likeLatestPopularTech News2 weeks agoNew Smartphones, OTA Updates & Tech Launched in Dec 2020 – Monthly Wrap-upTech News3 weeks agoAll-New Tripper Navigation System On Royal Enfield Meteor 350Officially Launched5 months agoXiaomi Launches Mi 10 Ultra With 120W Fast Charging & MIUI 12Smart Watch5 months agoHuawei Watch Fit Leaked With AMOLED Display & Heart Rate SensorTech News5 months agoHow a Start-up Transformed the Indian Mobile Gaming IndustryOfficially Launched5 months agoHTC Wildfire E2 Goes Official With Helio P22 SoC & HD+ DisplayOfficially Launched8 months agoHonor 9X Pro Without Google Services Goes For Sale In IndiaOfficially Launched8 months agoPoco F2 Pro 5G Launched With Flagship Specs & Quad CamerasOfficially Launched8 months agoVivo V19 Launched in India With Dual Selfie CamerasOfficially Launched8 months agoRealme Narzo 10 and 10A Launched With New MediaTek Helio SoCsCopyright © 2020 PHONERADAR.
