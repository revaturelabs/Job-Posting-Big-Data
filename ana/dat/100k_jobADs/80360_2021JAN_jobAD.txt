I tried for a working weekend last weekend and it just didn’t happen. I commented on another blog recently that the best way for me to stay focused and productive is to plan ahead. Everything I do is scheduled. Last week, I had a bunch of meetings scheduled at school and it through me off of my schedule, thus, the need to catch up. Sometimes I’m a huge fan of the four day work week. Other days, I’m ready to sign the petition for an eight day week.So much to do, so little time.Also, if you’re thinking of attending the Social Media Success Summit, please note this Thursday is the last day to save on the 50% off early bird special.We’re talking about our favorite apps at the Freelance Writing Jobs Facebook Group.
