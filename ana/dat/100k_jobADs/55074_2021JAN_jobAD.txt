Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may find this site particularly helpful, as would individuals with learning differences, ADD, speech or language disorders, and other areas of exceptionality. JobTIPS addresses the social and communication differences that might make identifying, obtaining, and keeping a job more difficult for you.http://www.do2learn.com/JobTIPS/index.htmlJobTIPS is designed for direct use by individuals with ASD and other learning differences. However, this program (including all of the printables, assessments, and videos) is also suitable for delivery by educators, family members, clinicians, mentors, and job coaches.http://www.do2learn.com/JobTIPS/index.htmlLucille A.
