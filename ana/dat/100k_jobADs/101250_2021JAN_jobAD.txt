What's not to love?Annie/Arianna Mitchell, LMPEvery one of your claims are true - the lack of staining and smell, the affinity with the skin, and my clients love that they don't get up from the table feeling like greased pigs (my words). Of course, as a massage therapist, none of that would matter if the grip and glide weren't perfect... and they are.Sara Garvin, LMTThere are some Maine products that serve us well through the sweltering days of August to the frigid days of January and every day in between. Jojoba is one of them!Jann MinzyI just want to let you know how much I love your Jojoba. I have been using it for about 10 years now, after seeing it at a massage convention. One year I decided to go cheaper and found my sheets smelling rancid and after throwing them out decided I'd never do that again.Katie DickinsonThe glide is perfect and I have yet to find another product that can rival its positive effects on the skin. And as a therapist who does mostly medical work, it is a wonderful thing to have found a product that none of my clients are allergic to.Jessica CollishawAfter few days of using it, I must admit that the product has proved itself beyond my expectations! My 4 year old son was suffering from a red bottom due to frequent wetting. Since I've used the Jojoba, his skin is bright, clean, and with no signs of red. I'm very grateful to you.Orit VainerWe have been using Hobacare for nearly two years now and have found our family's skin is amazing looking - which is truly a feat considering the eczema and dry skin that so plagues us!Heather B.My clients love Jojoba; it washes out of sheets and clothing easily, and it makes my work easier. The absence of fragrance is especially nice. I highly recommend it!Deb HewsonAfter more than 20 years of practice I have used numerous products. The Jojoba Oil is superior to any and all.Elizabeth BerksThank you so much for providing a wonderful product. I have been using your golden jojoba in my skincare products for many years and all my customers (and me) love it.KathleenRead More Kind Words & TestimonialsHomeWhat Is Jojoba?HobaCare vs. HobaCare OrganicLaundering and Storage Issues and InstructionsBibliographyUse JojobaHobaCare for Personal CareInformation About HobaCare BabyInformation for ProfessionalsAestheticians, Cosmetologists, and Skin-Care ProfessionalsInformation for AromatherapyInformation for ChiropractorsInformation for Massage ProfessionalsHobaCare BlogContact UsShop NowCategories101 Uses For JojobaAlternate UsesAromatherapyBabyBody CareDIYEmployee BlogEssential OilsFAQFor MenGift Basket IdeasHairHerbal MedicineHow Do You HobaCare?InfusionsJojoba PropertiesMake Your OwnMassage TherapyMisc.Mix of the MonthOfficeOncologyOur JojobaPersonal CarePetsRecipeSelf-CareSite NewsSkincareTeamNo Animal TestingMOFGA Certified OrganicUSDA Organic Certification800.256.5622EmailHours: Mon-Fri 9am-5pm ESTPrivacy PolicyReturn PolicyLike us on FacebookInstagram"
