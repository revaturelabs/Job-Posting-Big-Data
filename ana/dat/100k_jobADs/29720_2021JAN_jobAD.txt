Disability Confident is Government scheme which encourages organisations to take extra steps to support the inclusion of disabled people in their workforce. There are three levels of the scheme known as Committed, Employer and Leader. Organisations at the higher levels are proactively recruiting and supporting disabled workers.All employers on the Careers with Disabilities employer directory are required to state whether they are part of the Disability Confident Scheme and at which level.Reasonable adjustmentsBy law, employers must offer reasonable adjustments so that disabled people and those with long-term health conditions are not at a disadvantage. Adjustments should be offered both during the recruitment process and once employed. If you have concerns that an application process may disadvantage you, ask to apply in an alternative way. This could mean submitting your application in a different format or extra time during interviews or assessments. If you need further assistance, visit our guide on your rights as a disabled worker.If you choose to disclose your disability when applying for the job, then this is a great opportunity to start a conversation about the reasonable adjustments that could help you excel in the role. This could include changes to aspects such as the advertised hours or duties.Equality, Diversity and Inclusion policiesOrganisations outline the ways in which they are committed to equality, diversity and inclusion (ED&I). Reading up on these policies can help you understand the ways in which the company looks to improve the number of disabled workers in their workforce. It may also give you an insight as to how you may receive support to manage your disability or health condition while at work.Employee experiencesAnother great way to understand how an organisation supports their disabled workers is to approach a current employee for a first-hand review. Many organisations share employee experiences and stories via the careers section of their website. You could also ask the recruitment team for some information from a disabled employee.It is important to remember that all employers are required by law to offer alterations to the workplace to accommodate for an employee’s disability or health condition.
