I will list what I think are the best movies so far this year, and the rest of my list will consist of other great movies that did not quite make the cut. The movies that did not make the cut were still pretty awesome and worth seeing.Click on each movie for my full review, rating, trailer, and poster artwork for that film.So, without further ado, here is the list:The Best Movies of 2013 (in alphabetical order)2 Guns (2013)42 (2013)All is Lost (2013)American Hustle (2013)Captain Phillips (2013)Gravity (2013)The Iceman (2012)Lone Survivor (2013)Out of the Furnace (2013)Prisoners (2013)Best Sequels:The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)Red 2 (2013)Other Great Movies that did not make the cut (in alphabetical order)The Big Wedding (2013)Broken City (2013)Bullet to the Head (2012)The Conjuring (2013)Escape Plan (2013)Gangster Squad (2013)The Heat (2013)Jobs (2013)Man of Steel (2013)Mud (2012)Oblivion (2013)Oz The Great and Powerful (2013)The Place Beyond the Pines (2013)The Purge (2013)Star Trek Into Darkness (2013)Violet & Daisy (2011)White House Down (2013)The Wolverine (2013)World War Z (2013)Because the year is not over yet, I will continue to add to this list. That is of course, if I see a movie that is good enough to be on it. Considering the list of movies that are set to release before the end of the year, I’m sure that I will have no problem adding to this list.

He has been in a few serious films, but for the most part he has stuck with comedy. Usually you are unable to take Kutcher’s characters or the movies that he is in seriously. He has been a likable goofball for the majority of his acting career. Before watching Jobs, I knew that it had the potential to be a game changer for Ashton Kutcher’s career. If he played his part well, then in a sense, he could earn his wings and continue making real movies.Jobs is inspired by the true story of how Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) co-founded Apple Inc. after dropping out of college and became one of the most innovative creators and entrepreneurs of our time.The film was directed by Joshua Michael Stern and the rest of the noteworthy cast includes Dermot Mulroney, Matthew Modine, Josh Gad, J.K. Simmons, Ron Eldard, James Woods, Lukas Haas, John Getz, Kevin Dunn, Nelson Franklin, Robert Pine and Elden Henson.Since the movie is inspired by a true story, I would be interested in knowing exactly which parts are true and which parts are fiction.I will admit that before watching Jobs, I knew hardly anything about Steve Jobs. I knew that he founded Apple and he had a major role in the company’s success, but that was about it.As a child, the first computer that my family owned was an Apple Macintosh. That always stuck with me. Fast-forward to now and Apple is still the best in the business and always evolving.Jobs is an intriguing story about a hippie college dropout with a vision for greatness and an overwhelming passion to follow through on trying to make the world a better place.This is Kutcher’s best performance as an actor so far. He did a heck of a job as Jobs. The movie certainly has the potential to change Ashton Kutcher’s image and I foresee more serious movies in his future. Is it a game changer for him? I think that it certainly is.The rest of the cast did an excellent job in their supporting roles.The film felt a bit long-winded towards the end and it lacked more development of Steve’s family life. However, the film was uplifting and inspirational. It’s a worthy tribute to a genius who left his mark on the world.I rate this movie an 8 on a scale of 1-10.Buy, rent, or run? Buy.Posted in Drama Movie Reviews	Leave a commentTags: Apple Inc., Ashton Kutcher, Dermot Mulroney, Elden Henson, J.K.
