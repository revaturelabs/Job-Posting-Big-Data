We also had problems with finding the suppliers for these materials due to the Covid-19 challenges.”New stock was received on Friday and work to complete the repairs would continue into the coming week, Mangena said.He called for co-operation in ensuring the safety of repair teams.“We also appeal with you to co-operate with our teams when they do their job in your area. We will not hesitate to pull out our teams if we believe they are not safe, which will prolong the outages,” Mangena said.For more news your way, download The Citizen’s app for iOS and Android.BACK TO CITIZEN BACK TO PREMIUM JOIN PREMIUM SIGN IN SIGN OUTRelated StoriesPower outages a fact of life in SA 19.1.2021Eskom working on shortening load shedding in Joburg to 2 hours 18.1.2021Stage 2 load shedding back at 8am on Friday 14.8.2020MOST POPULARPAST 24 HOURS PAST WEEKLoading Posts...{{ index + 1 }}EDITOR'S CHOICEWorld WATCH: ‘The best’ four years later, it is Trump’s last day in powerGeneral Sanef calls for action against Somizi over doxxing of journalistsCourts ‘Racist’ medical aid inquiry findings are damningBusiness News Petrol heading for R20 per litre?Covid-19 Early signs of infection slowdown in some hotspots as ICU bed availability takes straintoday in printtoday in printContact usAbout usOur TeamCode of ConductPrivacy PolicyAdvertising Rate CardTerms and ConditionsNewsSouth AfricaAfricaWorldLoad SheddingEish!OpinionColumnsEditorialsCartoonsTalking PointSportColumnsCricketOtherRugbySoccerGolfHorsesColumnistsRacing NewsYour lifeCelebs & viralFoodstyleEntertainmentSoapiesMotoringMotoring NewsfeaturesMotorsportnew price guideBiking With BonesWhat She SaidOtherAuctionsbuy in bulkClassifiedsCompetitionsAbout usOur TeamCode of ConductContact usPrivacy PolicyJobs at The CitizenRate Card#2140547 (no title)About ParentyAbout usAccount AdminAdvertising Rate CardBoost your brand this Black FridaybuyinbulkCard GamesCartCheckoutCitizen Daily NewsletterCitizen Daily Newsletter 2Citizen Google SearchCitizen Premium supportCode of ConductContact usCosafa TVDurban July 2020Editors ChoiceElections 2019Fan ZoneFAQs – Digital Subscription InformationGeneral Newsletterhorses pollhorses poll resultsIframeJobs at The CitizenLifestyle Editor NewsletterMailChimp for WordPress: Form PreviewMembership BenefitsMy accountNewsletterNewsletter GeneralNewsletter Horseracingnewsletter horsesNewsletter LifestyleNewsletter MotoringNewsletter Phakaaathinewsletter sportOur TeamPassword ResetPhakaaathi Newsletter February 2016Popular PostsPremium Digital OffersPremium LoginPrivacy PolicyPromotionsPSL ResultsSpecialsStaff Account RenewelSubscribeSubscribe to our newsletter!SubscribersTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF CITIZEN.CO.ZATHE CITIZEN APPThe Citizen e-edition/ print bundle subscription ratesThe Citizen.
