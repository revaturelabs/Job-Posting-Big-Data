Police uniform secured and convict cuffed, the inmates have created a diversion leaving all remaining inmates in cells unguarded. With nerves of steel, we made our gutsy move to break free, question is can you?Crazy enough to break out of Alcatraz, after a few years rest, we decided to return to crime, but this time we decided to break in and show them who‚Äôs boss and pull off a big diamond heist and get that much needed cash boost into our depleted bank accounts.We grabbed our elite squad of highly skilled bank robbers, as we were amongst the chosen few who had been challenged to infiltrate the security systems at the world‚Äôs most protected bank vaults.Part of our team attempted the skilled system override on the previous night but failed. They did manage to disable the security cameras and took the opportunity to leave us clues, so myself and the team were now fully prepped to break into the vault and steal the dazzling diamond.Escape with the diamond within 60 minutes or face life in prison! An exhilarating, exciting and entertaining experience, will your team diamond bank balance go boom or bust!As always the games masters and all the team were fabulous!Thank you for reading üòäMelanie xxContact:https://booknow.escapereality.com/manchester/games/Share this:TwitterFacebookLinkedInTumblrPinterestLike this:Like Loading...Posted in Escape rooms, Things to do in Manchester	bloggersEscape games ManchesterEscape rooms ManchesterManchester Escape rooms	Post navigation< Previous Escape Hunt Manchester Cowboys Vs Pirates: Wild West & Blackbeard‚Äôs Treasure Escape Rooms #ReviewNext > Drive into 2019 with TeamSport Manchester go Karting #Review75 thoughts on ‚ÄúEscape Reality Manchester Break out & Break in: Alcatraz & Bank Job Escape Rooms #Review‚Äù	Hayley Warren says:	February 25, 2019 at 1:07 pmI really need to do another escape room, they are so fun!LikeLiked by 1 personReplyforkwardthinkingfoodinista says:	March 1, 2019 at 3:29 pmThey are very fun and both these games were fab xxLikeLikeReplymotherhoodtherealdeal says:	February 25, 2019 at 2:42 pmWow this sounds like a lot of fun!
