I am in a project role and my concern before I accepted was that my hours would go far above 20 hours. I called the hiring director and expressed my concern in which they stated that would not happen. After starting my new job I have been required to attend training and other project tasks that exceed my 20 hours. I have even been told not to enter my time worked correctly but only to enter 20 hours a week. I am being asked to produce as much as my full-time peers and can not get additional work because of the time it is taking up. Is this practice legal? I know companies are trying to cut costs but this seems dishonest.Tags: NonePattymdSenior MemberJoin Date: Jul 2005Posts: 31843ShareTweet#202-27-2009, 04:23 AMduplicate postI don't respond to Private Messages unless the moderator specifically refers you to me for that purpose.
