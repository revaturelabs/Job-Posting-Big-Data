The scammers frequently misappropriate and use a company’s logo and photos of its executives to give the appearance of legitimacy. The scam preys upon those seeking employment, and uses false fraudulent offers of employment with employers, such as CBS, to steal from the victims. CBS believes that one of the best ways to put a stop to this scam is to make you aware of it.No applicant for employment with CBS is ever required to pay any money as part of the job application or hiring process, and CBS’s job recruitment process involves in person and/or telephonic interviews in most cases.In addition, CBS’s job recruiting staff sends email communications to job applicants from “@cbs.com” email accounts only. Any email that states to be from CBS but does not have a “@cbs.com” address should be assumed to be fraudulent.Recognizing Recruiting FraudThe following are warning signs of recruiting fraud:You are required to provide your credit card, bank account number(s) or other personal financial information as part of the “job application” process.The open position does not appear on the company’s website listing of job positions.The contact email address contains a domain other than “@cbs.com”, such as “@live.com”, “@gmail.com”, or another personal email account.The position required an initial monetary investment, such as a payment by wire transfer.The posting includes spelling and grammatical errors.You are offered a payment or “reward” in exchange for allowing the use of your bank account (e.g., for depositing checks or transferring money related to employment).You are asked to provide a photo of yourself.The job posting does not mention required qualifications and job responsibilities, but instead focuses on the amount of money to be made.The job posting reflects initial pay that is high compared to the average compensation for the position type.The \"employer\" contacts you by phone, but there is no way to call them back or the number is not active or goes only to a voice message box.What You Can DoIf you believe you have been the victim of job recruiting fraud, you can:File an incident report at http://www.cybercrime.govFile a complaint with the FBI at: https://ic3.govCall the FTC at: 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357)Contact the local police to report the fraud.Contact your bank or credit card company to close the account and dispute the charges.Recruiting Fraud Statement Reasonable Accommodations EEO is the Law EEO is the Law Poster Supplement Pay Transparency Nondiscrimination ProvisionTerms of UsePrivacy PolicySustainability & ESGDo Not Sell My Personal InformationContact© ViacomCBS Inc.
