We are currently looking to increase our temp pool for a supermarket distribution centre in Palmerston North. The work involves using a pump truck (we can help you get this Crown licence) to pick products from the warehouse while listening to a headset. You must have flexible availability/be available for an immediate start, be reliable, have your own transport to get to/from work, have a clean MOJ and ACC check, and be able to pass a pre-employment drug test. This is physical work so you must be fit and able to safely lift heavy boxes. We cannot guarantee hours, however the more reliable and hard-working you are, the more hours you will get - and eventually you will go permanent with this great company!
