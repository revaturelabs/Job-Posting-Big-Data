I hope you‚Äôre all having a great summer so far whatever that means to you!First up! Bob‚Äôs Folk Show Distilled Pt1.I did a session for Bob in January of this year and had a great time. I got chance to hang out with the man himself for a few hours and then had the pleasure of performing pretty much all of the songs on my album live in the studio. Bob now has a second outlet for his show which he is calling Bob‚Äôs Folk show Distilled where he put selected highlights from his live show together as a show. I‚Äôm on the first one that was aired last week! Bobs Folk Show Distilled Pt1. I‚Äôm on at around 15minutes but I also highly recommend checking out the other artists. It‚Äôs a great show.I‚Äôll be heading down to London in October to perform at a festival Bob is responsible for putting on called London Folk & Roots Festival which will be held at Amersham Arms on 28th October .Secondly! I did a gig on Saturday at The Lomax, Liverpool. Awesome gig and awesome venue. The Lomax was reopened recently as a music venue and has a great and supportive vibe for good music. It‚Äôs run by T2F and I‚Äôll be heading there again for a gig on Sun 26th August for the bank holiday festival. Lots and lots of bands and acoustic acts. I‚Äôll be playing solo in the upstairs room at 8pm.
