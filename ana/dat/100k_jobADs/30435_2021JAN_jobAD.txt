"How to register a custom Assessment Job within the Windows Assessment Console – Anything about ITMenuAnything about ITby Alex VerboonPrimary MenuSkip to contentHomeAbout meBlogpost IndexLinksPrivacy PolicySearchSearch for:How to register a custom Assessment Job within the Windows Assessment ConsolePosted on 17 April 2012 17 April 2012 AuthorAlex Verboon3 CommentsIn the Scaling And Extending Windows Assessments To Improve System Quality (Part I & II) presentation shown at the //BUILD conference in September Jason Cohen a Senior Software Development Engineer at Microsoft demonstrated how to create a custom Assessment job using a Ping test as example.Excited about the idea of extending the Windows Assessment Console with self-defined tests, I have since spend quite some time reading the related documentation on MSDN. I can imagine that one day I would be able to automate a large amount of system validation and certification tests that nowadays are performed manually or with individual scripts can be fully integrated into the Assessment Console that not only takes care of the automation but also provides a nice reporting interface.When you have the ADK installed,. you find all of the pre-defined Assessments stored under the folder C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\Assessment and Deployment Kit\\Windows Assessment Toolkit.Content based AssessmentsEnergyMemory AssessmentsWindows Core AssessmentsWhen opening one of these *.asmtx files you will notice that the files have an XML Syntax, a complete overview can be found in the AXE Schema Reference on MSDN However I guess at very first moment the average Tech guy (like me) will be overwhelmed by the vast number of Elements that can be used for the Assessment, Job and Result manifests.I initially tried to reverse engineer some things, but had poor results and unfortunately there aren’t any examples posted on MSDN yet, so I decided to drop Jason an e-mail if he could pass on the Ping Test example he had used for demonstration purposes in his Demo. A few days later he kindly responded and send me the Ping-Test files. I was then able to register it within the Assessment Console and it also provided me with a basis to create my first own assessment called Folder-Test which isn’t perfectly complete, but gives an idea of what can be done further.Now let me guide you through the process of registering a custom Assessment job.Download the samples I have stored hereCreate a folder called CustomAssessments under C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\Assessment and Deployment Kit\\Windows Assessment Toolkit\\ and copy all the files provided in the samples ZIP file into this folder.Then to register the Ping Test Assessment and the Folder Test Assessment run the following commandsC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\Assessment and Deployment Kit\\Windows Assessment Toolkit\\x86\\regasmt.exe “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\Assessment and Deployment Kit\\Windows Assessment Toolkit\\CustomAssessments\\pingtest.asmtx”C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\Assessment and Deployment Kit\\Windows Assessment Toolkit\\x86\\regasmt.exe “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\Assessment and Deployment Kit\\Windows Assessment Toolkit\\CustomAssessments\\foldertest.asmtx”What regasmt.exe does is creating a new entry under:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Assessments\\InstalledWhen now opening the Assessment Console you will find the new custom PING Assessment Jobs listed under the “Run Individual Assessment” Node.The same for the Folder TestNote that when running regasmt it validates the manifest file and if there are errors the registration fails, also if later you edit/update the manifest file, even if it is registered already, when there are syntax issues, the assessment will not be shown in the Assessment console.Now that the Assessments are registered we can execute them directly from the assessment console or package them to be executed on another system.I hope I could spread some inspiration on what can be done with the Assessment Console. Many thanks to Jason for sharing his example with me.Share this:TweetEmailLike this:Like Loading...Related posts:Windows 8 ADK Assessments OS and Architecture Support OverviewWindows 8 – Script for customizing WinPE 4.0 – Part 1Using the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool with custom ISO filesPerforming a Windows Performance Assessment with the Windows ADKAutomated Download and Installation for the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK)CategoriesADK, Windows 7, Windows 8TagsADK, Assessment, AXE, Custom JobsPost navigation← Previous Previous post: GPO Template for UE-V SettingsTemplateCatalogPath configurationNext → Next post: How to remove the system reserved partition3 Replies to “How to register a custom Assessment Job within the Windows Assessment Console”	Pingback: Windows Assessment Toolkit for Windows 8: Performance monitoring for everyone « Surya R PraveenDiana says:	3 March 2017 at 14:41:37	Hi, Alex, and first of all – thank you for your post and for the link to Jason’s tutorial. Have you gone further with the developing your own assessments for AXE?I know the post is almost 5-years old, though, in case someone will have the problem with the registering your provided examples due to error “SameIsPass is not allowed…”, it seems not to be maintened in ADK 10. Probably the right way to replace is ?Jut like you several years ago, I need some help from more experienced IT specialist, with customising AXE jobs… probably, you may help me? I would be grateful if you contact me by e-mail.

The previous element was probably deprecated.Leave a Reply	Cancel replySearch for:ArchivesNovember 2020October 2020September 2020July 2020June 2020May 2020April 2020March 2020January 2020December 2019November 2019October 2019September 2019August 2019July 2019June 2019May 2019March 2019February 2019January 2019December 2018October 2018May 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017July 2017June 2017March 2017February 2017December 2016November 2016October 2016September 2016July 2016April 2016March 2016February 2016January 2016December 2015October 2015September 2015July 2015June 2015May 2015April 2015February 2015December 2014November 2014October 2014September 2014August 2014July 2014June 2014May 2014April 2014January 2014December 2013November 2013October 2013September 2013August 2013July 2013June 2013May 2013April 2013March 2013February 2013January 2013December 2012November 2012October 2012September 2012August 2012July 2012June 2012May 2012April 2012March 2012February 2012January 2012December 2011November 2011October 2011September 2011August 2011July 2011June 2011May 2011April 2011March 2011February 2011January 2011December 2010November 2010October 2010September 2010August 2010July 2010June 2010May 2010April 2010March 2010February 2010January 2010December 2009November 2009October 2009September 2009August 2009July 2009June 2009May 2009April 2009March 2009February 2009January 2009December 2008November 2008October 2008September 2008August 2008July 2008June 2008May 2008Copyright © 2021 Anything about IT.
