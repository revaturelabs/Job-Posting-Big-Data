"A jobseeker’s shame and worries about peak Corbyn… | Man On LedgeMan On LedgeJulian Cole takes in the viewMenumSkip to contentHomeAboutMay 4th, 2018A jobseeker’s shame and worries about peak Corbyn…IN the spirit of mixing unconnected stories, this morning I bring you naked cleaners and partially clothed local election results.The cleaners are the subject of a story in the Daily Mirror, while the local election results are shared by all.The Mirror reports that an unnamed Yorkshire woman in her 30s was outraged when she saw on a government website an advert for a company employing naked cleaners.The woman, who is on Jobseeker’s Allowance, was said to be “embarrassed and distressed” by seeing the advert, saying: “I thought that sort of attitude of the objectification of women was in the past.”The unlikely sounding job was for work with a company called Fantasy Cleans – “cleaners with a difference”. Now I have had the average amount of sexual fantasies, at a guess, but not one of them has entailed hiring a cleaner who sets to work wearing only rubber gloves and a smile.The jobseeker alerted her MP, Labour’s Naz Smith, who tells the Mirror: “My constituent, a single woman on Jobseeker’s Allowance, facing extreme financial hardship, drew our attention to the advert on the government’s own job search platform.”People who sign up for that benefit are expected to spend hours trawling job websites to prove they have made sufficient effort for their meagre benefit. It is a demeaning and wearying process, as I can testify from a miserable five or six weeks doing just that in my post-redundancy life.I’ve no idea how such an advert makes it onto a government platform, but at a guess it’s because nobody other than the poor sods who are required to trawl the job ads ever looks closely at the website.By the by, our kitchen floor could do with a clean. You will be relieved to hear I intend to remain fully dressed when doing that bit of domestic drudgery.With the local election results coming in, the consensus seems to be that the Conservatives had a slightly better night than expected, while Labour had a slightly worse night than expected. A sort of political nil-nil when Labour had been talking up something featuring more goals.In its round-up of the day’s stories, the Guardian calls on the headline: “Have we passed peak Corbyn?” This refers to something said on the BBC election programme by Justine Greening, Tory MP and former education secretary – “Maybe we are beginning to see something akin to peak Corbyn happening.”As someone almost once said a long time ago: “Well, she would say that, wouldn’t she?”Here are two thoughts about those local election results:ONE: Yes, hitting peak Corbyn was always going to be a danger. While the Labour leader is strong on the stump, great at stirring a crowd – and while some of his policies have broad appeal – he is faced with a long slog before he gets to use those skills in another election. Nearly a year after his markedly better than expected defeat, his dull but dogged opponent is slogging on, loved by few but marginally ahead in the polls.TWO: If life is local, then there is something galling about reading all the interpretations of the local election results in terms of what they mean for Corbyn or Mrs Maybe. Yes, last night’s local elections – which weren’t taking place around here – are the first big test for Theresa May after that unnecessary election of last year. But they involved local people voting, if they bothered at all, for local candidates who represent them on local matters. It’s a shame that the only time national media people become interested in local politics is when they can spin a national story from local yarn.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...RelatedPost navigationPrevious ArticleVinyl Frontier: Chappo by Roger ChapmanNext ArticleNow give us a real headline…Leave a Reply	Cancel replySearchSearchArchiveArchive Select Month January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015CategoriesUncategorizedSubscribe via EmailEmail AddressSubscribeSearch© Copyright 2018 Man On Ledge.w f%d bloggers like this:"
