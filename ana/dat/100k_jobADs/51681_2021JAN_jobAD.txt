Some of the information may not reflect the current situation.What's it like?Businesses are increasingly using data analytics to improve decision making. It’s how an organisation gets a better understanding of their customers or identifies product trends. Think about flight prices: airlines will raise prices during busy times when lots of people want to fly to a destination and then reduce them during quieter times to attract customers. Data science helps inform these decisions.As a data scientist you’d collect, extract and analyse large amounts of raw data from a range of sources like surveys, analytics or cookies on a website. Then, using algorithms, data mining, artificial intelligence, machine learning and statistical tools you’d look for patterns or insights. You’d will then present your results to help the business make predictions or find solutions to problems.​​​​​​​Things you might doWork with your organisation to identify issues or opportunities to use dataCollect raw data and turn it to a useable formatLooking for patterns in the data to help Identify trendsTest data mining models in order to select the model that best fits the requirementSolve business-related problems using machine learning tools and statistical techniquesPresent your results to your organisation or clientStay on top of analytic techniques like machine learning and text analyticsWork with a variety of programming languages, including SAS, R and PythonWorking conditionsHoursWorking hours can vary, but usually full-time hours will be Monday to Friday and around 37 hours per week.
