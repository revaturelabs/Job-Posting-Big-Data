You don’t need a doctorate to work out what will happen if - or more accurately when - the process finds that cutbacks are needed.Now to address the not-so-invisible elephant in the room: Brexit.The Tories claim they have 'got Brexit done' - but that's done little to ease the uncertaintyAlthough it may not have been the defining element of these decisions, each of the above straddled January 31 - the date of our official departure from the EU, and the start of this year-long transition phase.You could argue these regular sad stories coming as Brexit begins in earnest are just a coincidence.Liverpool City Region Business NewsSignature Living firms in administrationLFC pushes back Anfield Road stand plansBusinesses stay connectedThe people banned from running a companyThat our departure from the EU and everything that comes with it are entirely unrelated to firms evidently losing confidence in the UK as a place to manufacture and do business. But you’d be on thin ice.Let’s focus on what was probably the most significant of the three announcements: JLR.Want more business news straight to your inbox?BusinessLive is your home for business news from around the country - and you can stay in touch with all the latest news through our email alerts.You can sign up to receive daily morning news bulletins from every region we cover and to weekly email bulletins covering key economic sectors from manufacturing to technology and enterprise.

In fact, many people have outright denied that to be the case, and there are certainly other relevant factors such as a global glut in production as well as falling car sales in China.But despite having first learnt of the change to shift patterns last autumn, this news will still have come as a shock to many at Halewood, given the sheer scale of cuts.The Unilever plant in Warrington could closeAt a time when our region is feeling more politically vulnerable than at any point in the previous few decades, this latest announcement that sent ripples around the UK’s car making industry was the news no one wanted.And it's not the only car manufacturer in our region that appears to be in some trouble at the moment.In December, it was revealed the next Vauxhall Astra model is to be made in Germany, news which led to calls for jobs to be protected at the Ellesmere Port plant.Follow North West Business Editor Tom HoughtonTom Houghton is the North West Business Editor for BusinessLive and Reach plc titles.You can follow Tom on Twitter here, or contact him on Facebook.Email him on tom.houghton@reachplc.com.Keep up to date with the latest breaking news in the North West here.Sign up to our fantastic daily email updates for the region here.Follow @livechobusiness and @businesslive on TwitterWorkers at the Cheshire site will be desperately hoping they don't get similar news to that at Halewood - a situation that will now hit hundreds of families in our region over the coming months and years.But with the car industry appearing to be in decline faster than most expected, it's anyone's guess as to what happens next.Car giant JLR is cutting jobs at its Halewood plant in Merseyside, according to Unite. (Image: PA)That’s even more the case now, given the way Brexit is going.We now have well under a year to negotiate a new trade arrangement with the EU, a task that to many seems impossible, hence making a no-deal Brexit all the more likely.On the subject of a potential no-deal, it’s a scenario openly feared by many firms across our region, not least Vauxhall, whose owner PSA Group has warned it could spell the end of the Ellesmere Port plant. Investment would switch instead to southern Europe.A view of Vauxhall's assembly plant in Ellesmere Port (Image: Getty Images Europe)Although JLR may have said the decision to cut 500 jobs last month wasn’t a result of Brexit, the firm’s warnings that tens of thousands of UK motor industry jobs will be put at risk if the UK crashes out with no-deal are well documented.Industries such as aerospace, automotive, chemicals, food and drink and pharma have already warned the government how they would be affected by the type of ‘bare bones’ agreement that could come at the end of the year - or indeed leaving without a deal.Read MoreRelated ArticlesFormer Thomas Cook staff return to work as old branch finally reopens as Hays TravelEither way, we will have a big dollop more of our old, familiar friend, uncertainty. Uncertainty - that thing we all thought would go away by “getting Brexit done” on January 31.Be it deal or no deal, as the last three years have shown, Mr Johnson and chief unelected bureaucrat (I thought Brexit meant we were getting rid of those too?) Dominic Cummings prefer to appease hard-right Tories by adopting a consistent scorched earth tactic.That means keeping intact this bizarre, immovable aim of completing negotiations by the end of the year - do or die.The Prime Minister’s clear contempt for our region - not to mention protecting manufacturing jobs - certainly leaves this Liverpool resident fretting over what’s to follow in the months and years to come.Follow @businessliveMore OnConservative PartyEuropean UnionJaguar Land RoverPoliticsNorth WestEconomic DevelopmentallMost ReadMost RecentNetwork Rail18 railway lines axed by Beeching could be reopened in West of EnglandThe bids are being considered under proposals to reverse cuts to the railways made in the 1960sDetailed plans of £100m Holyhead waterfront redevelopment with 250 berth marina revealedWalesCAD Architects has been appointed to the scheme by Conygar and a public consultation has startedSeven rail proposals to level up the UK -
