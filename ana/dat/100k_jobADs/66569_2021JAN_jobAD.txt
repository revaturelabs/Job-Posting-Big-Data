Spencer, a one time Buckeye, finished out his college career with Eastern Kentucky becoming an FCS All American in his senior year. RB Coach Tim Spencer’s son played with him before his ejection from Ohio State.“He’s a pleasant young man,” Spencer said. “I didn’t get to talk to him much, but I get to talk to him now, to find out what type of kid he is.”The defense will be led by new Coordinator Mike Smith who is tweaking the defensive package to become a “flexible” 4-3 based scheme.“We’re looking for as much flexibility as we possibly can, to be able to scheme against our opponents, to be able to prepare for injuries,” Smith said Thursday. “You have to have multiple guys prepared at different positions.”The Bucs kick off the preseason on the road against the Philadelphia Eagles before returning home to face the Jacksonville Jaguars at EverBank Field. Plenty of great seats and affordable tickets are already available for all preseason and regular season games.
