Due to the coronavirus pandemic, service delivery methods have had to shift to largely a virtual format. With a substantial rise in unemployment and the growing need to provide employment and training services to unemployed and underemployed individuals, we can all agree that AJCs are a lifeline.Most AJCs are now offering innovative programs and services in online and remote formats for employment-related services such as outreach, assessments, case management, training, referrals, career counseling, etc. In this blog, we will discuss these formats in more detail and lay out all the best practices in virtual services for you to use as a guide to ensure your clients’ job-seeking needs are met in the most innovative ways.These are some of the questions that were top of mind while writing this blog: How can AJCs efficiently and effectively service the millions of unemployed and displaced workers now? What are the best communication methods we can use to connect with clients and jobseekers? How can we help clients access technology-based tools to assist in their job search? Keep reading and these questions will be answered.Experts say coping with and recovering from the economic strain of the COVID-19 pandemic will require a new, tech-forward approach to regional hiring and workforce development. In response, AJCs are providing more flexibility in offering program services by using online and virtual options for education and training for various workforce programs. Digital tools, software and online resources are critical in providing virtual services while still meeting all the eligibility requirements associated with WIOA.In this blog, you will learn more about the following:Virtual Services Best PracticesJobseeker Top Tech ToolsInnovative Program Design ElementsVirtual Services Best PracticesIn recent months, we wrote an in-depth blog about providing virtual workforce services in this trying time.

Video Technology Interview and Training PreparationPreparing jobseekers to search for and land a job takes a lot of time and effort. As a first order of business, it is important to start preparing them for the interview process. Role-playing is one of the most effective methods for giving jobseekers a real glimpse at what an interview is like. Staff may suggest that they watch interview sessions on YouTube as a starting point in getting familiar with the setting and type of questions asked.Job Coaches, Instructors and other AJC staff can then conduct a mock interview to prep jobseekers for the real thing. Another effective idea is to organize an interview roundtable event for jobseekers, which features local employers who will facilitate a session in an authentic interview environment. Video conferencing software such as Facetime, Skype, or Zoom makes it easy to connect with jobseekers to do this preparation work. Check out this blog for more ways to equip jobseekers with tools for success and barriers remediation.Another option is to provide more comprehensive job skills workshops. By doing so, jobseekers are provided with a deeper understanding of workplace expectations and the skills needed to succeed in team-oriented workplaces. Workshops such as You’re HIRED – an exclusive job and life curriculum launched by the workforce and talent consulting firm EDSI – focuses on job readiness, customer service, leadership and life skills. Emphasis is placed on creating a comprehensive, quality work portfolio including resumes, cover letters, recommendations, thank-you notes and other employment support materials.2. Virtual job fairs and recruitment eventsDid you know 80% of employers expect their recruiting efforts to remain virtual for the foreseeable future? That means this format is here to stay, so let’s learn a little more about it.Workforce programs and CareerLinks may use learning management systems or other online platforms to create an effective forum to host virtual job fairs that connect employers and jobseekers. Besides the cost-savings involved in hosting and attending, there are several benefits to both parties when using this format:easily accessible to anyone in any locationone-on-one meeting options between employer & jobseekerseamless application process (jobseeker)efficient record keeping (employer)3. Professional Networking and MentoringSocial media platforms like LinkedIn offer jobseekers a direct connection to professionals in their desired field, job openings and learning opportunities. Many AJC staff are skilled at helping jobseekers set up a LinkedIn account and they will be able to upload their resume, apply for jobs and start connecting with potential employers seeking to fill open positions. The Groups function on LinkedIn is also a valuable tool used to connect with industry-specific professional organizations or associations that will provide connections to potential hiring opportunities.Mentoring is another way to strengthen and widen a jobseeker’s network. Many CareerLinks have implemented virtual mentoring programs in which jobseekers are matched with mentors who meet via video conference to discuss topics related to career growth in a framework that is meaningful.4. Remote VolunteeringDon’t discount the value of volunteering in order for jobseekers to gain relevant industry experience and connect with professionals in the field. Volunteering is also a great way for jobseekers to bridge employment gaps while out of work. Although traditionally an in-person experience, many companies and organizations are now offering meaningful virtual opportunities for people to volunteer.
