In contrast, we have continued to go from strength to strength.”The expansion by Jet2 comes just days after the latest figures showed Glasgow airport’s passenger levels plunged 9.4 per cent last month compared to a year ago. The airport has lost nearly one in ten of its flyers after being badly hit by the collapse of Flyglobespan and Kiss Flights.Amanda McMillan, managing director of Glasgow Airport, said: “The 150 jobs being created demonstrate the importance of the airport to the local and national economy.”The move puts Jet2 in direct competition with easyJet, which has been operating out of Glasgow for 15 years.Paul Simmons, UK general manager for easyJet said: “As the UK and Glasgow’s largest airline, we have seen many airlines come and go, we continue to be the airline of choice for Scotland.”InsiderScotlandFollow @insidermagMore OnEdinburgh AirportGlasgow AirporteasyJetScottish EnterpriseNewsallMost ReadMost RecentNorth Sea oilWeatherford proposes closing its Aberdeen
