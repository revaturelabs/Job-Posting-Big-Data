This means the company will have to consider making some staff members redundant. In editorial this could mean up to eight staff could potentially lose their jobs.”These latest cuts come as a wave of cost-cutting hits the entire regional press. With publications reporting advertising down by around 20 per cent year on year hundreds of jobs have been cut at regional newspapers in recent weeks.SIGN UP HERE FORMEDIA MONITORPress Gazette's weekly email providing strategic insight into the future of the mediaSubscribeRelated StoriesReach insiders speak out on latest redundancy plan as Mirror publisher surpasses 1,000 job cuts in a decadeGender pay gap figures in full: Conde Nast, Telegraph and Economist groups among worst offenders for pay disparity in UK mediaRegional ABCs: MEN has top circulation but no dailies put on salesRegional ABCs: 38 weeklies increase sales year-on-yearCommentsNo comments to displayLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
