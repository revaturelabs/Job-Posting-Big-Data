This can range from simple obedience training for pets, through to more advanced training for working dogs, such as security or law enforcement dogs and assistance dogs. In many cases, dog handlers/trainers will also have to teach the dog's owner how to behave around the dog to ensure any training remains effective.Working conditionsWorking conditions for dog handlers/trainers can vary greatly, depending on the type of training being carried out. Most obedience training for pet dogs is conducted outside, at boarding kennels or community parks. This sort of training is usually carried out in the evenings or on weekends.Some specialised training may be carried out in specially designed facilities, tailored to the type of training. In some cases, one-on-one training may also be carried out in a client's home, especially if trying to modify a dog's behavioural problem.Tools and technologiesDog handlers/trainers will use different equipment, depending on the type of training they are offering. Almost all trainers use food rewards to encourage positive behaviours in the dogs they are training. There are also options for negative reinforcement or punishment, such as choker collars or shock collars. However, these technologies are becoming less common throughout Australia and many professional dog handlers/trainers no longer use such techniques. Trainers working in the security or law enforcement fields also use special protective clothing when training dogs to attack.How do I become one?Education and trainingIt is possible to work as a dog handler or trainer without any formal qualifications and get training on the job. Skills can be developed through practice and experience with dogs. However, entry into this occupation may be improved by obtaining a qualification in companion animal services or a related area.The Certificate III and IV in Companion Animal Services are offered at Western Australian TAFE colleges and other registered training organisations. Browse courses through Jobs and Skills WA and search on the My Skills website to find a registered provider near you.You can also undertake a traineeship in companion animal services (level 3 or level 4). The traineeships usually take 24 months to complete.The National Dog Trainers Federation also offers a Certificate III in Dog Behaviour and Training. The course can be completed by distance education; however, students must attend two practical sessions in Sydney, Melbourne or on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland. Contact the National Dog Trainers Federation for more information.The Western Australian Police, Australian Border Force, Australian Federal Police and the Australian Defence Force select potential dog trainers or handlers from within their organisations and conduct internal training courses.Related coursesACM30117: Animal StudiesACM30417: Companion Animal ServicesApprenticeships and traineeshipsAs an apprentice or trainee, you enter into a formal training contract with an employer, enabling you to complete training towards a nationally recognised qualification.
