Of these, 800,000 are NEET for over a year.What is LEO?Our Youth Jobs Gap series uses newly available government data aka longitudinal education outcomes (LEO) to shed light on these hidden challenges for youth unemployment. LEO uses data from the National Pupil Database, Higher Education Statistics Agency (now Office for Students), Individual Learner Records and HMRC tax records.FindingsDisadvantaged young people are twice as likely to be NEET as their better-off peersThe Employment Gap is consistent over timeLondon stands out for having a much smaller Employment Gap than other regionsHigher levels of qualification are associated with lower NEET rates, with the gap between low and middle qualifications especially sizableOver time, levels of qualification have improved for both disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged young peopleThe proportion of low qualified young people who are NEET has barely changed in recent years, even though the proportion of young people with low qualification has fallenAt all levels of qualification, disadvantaged young people are more likely to be NEET than their better-off peers with similar qualificationsSummaryDisadvantaged young people are twice as likely to be NEET as their better off peersWhile half this gap can be explained by differences in qualification, half cannotThe picture varies across the country, but with bigger variation within regions than between them (coming soon!)Read the first report in the Youth Jobs Gap series: Youth Jobs Gap: Establishing the Employment Gap.Support available for schoolsThe Access ProjectAction TutoringDallaglio RugbyWorksFootball Beyond BordersIntoUniversityMagic BreakfastPlace2BePower2ThinkForwardVenture TrustWest London ZoneApprenticeship supportThe Department for Education fund the National Apprenticeships Service and they fund the 'Ask' programme.
