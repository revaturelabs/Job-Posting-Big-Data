That same report chronicles how Latino workers in some industries and states are more likely to suffer potentially fatal injuries than others.How big of an issue are workplace fatalities in California?Data compiled by the AFL-CIO shows that California had the second-highest Latino worker fatality rates in 2017 with 173 employee deaths. At least 68%, or 161, of California’s Latinos who died on the job that same year were immigrants.Which workers are most apt to lose their lives on the job?The AFL-CIO data says that 291 Latinos who lost their lives on the job in 2017 worked in the construction field. The next highest workplace fatality rate was among those employed in the landscaping, waste management, or administrative sectors with 134 worker deaths. The industries with the third highest fatality rate were the warehousing and trucking ones with 132 deaths.There was an uptick in certain types of fatal workplace accidents involving Latinos in 2017. An increasing number of construction workers died after falling off of scaffolding onto a lower level. Some 231 Latino workers suffered a similar fate in 2017. There was an uptick in trees falling on top of landscapers, killing them. The number of long-distance freight tractor-trailer crashes involving Latino workers increased as well. At least 325 Latino workers lost their lives in similar incidents in 2017.What should you do if you suffered injuries on the job?Some Glendale employers cut corners when it comes to workplace safety and just hope that no one will get hurt. Their negligence inevitably backfires on them at some point, and a worker ends up having an incident that leaves them with debilitating injuries — or worse. It’s only then that they try to implement safety strategies to avoid future outcomes.A workers’ compensation attorney is the right person to consult with if you suffered injuries on the job. They’ll help you determine if your California employer must pay for your medical care and lost wages in your case.FacebookTwitterLinkedInSearch for:CategoriesBlog (2)Firm News (1)On-the-job Accidents (23)Workers' Compensation (30)Workplace Injuries (32)ArchivesJanuary 2021 (2)December 2020 (4)November 2020 (2)October 2020 (3)September 2020 (3)August 2020 (2)July 2020 (4)June 2020 (3)May 2020 (2)April 2020 (5)March 2020 (3)January 2020 (5)October 2019 (3)September 2019 (2)August 2019 (4)July 2019 (2)June 2019 (3)May 2019 (2)April 2019 (3)March 2019 (3)February 2019 (2)January 2019 (4)December 2018 (2)November 2018 (3)October 2018 (2)September 2018 (3)August 2018 (3)July 2018 (3)June 2018 (2)May 2018 (3)April 2018 (2)March 2018 (4)February 2018 (1)Recent PostsInjury hazards inherent to California’s entertainment industryWhat’s the difference between a QME and an AME in a workers’ compensation dispute?The injury risks faced by cashiersWrist injuries are common among workersWhat’s the most dangerous part of construction work?Subscribe To This Blog's FeedEMAIL US FOR A RESPONSEGet Started Today.
