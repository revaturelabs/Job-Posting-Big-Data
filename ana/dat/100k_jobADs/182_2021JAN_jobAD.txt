Job reductions will be across the company. The store closures don’t include the famed flagship near the Opera Garnier in Paris.“Printemps now has to transform its model to halt the losses and adapt to the market demands to ensure its long-term sustainability,” the company said.France has entered its second lockdown, imposed on Oct. 30 amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases. All non-essential shops across the country are closed, but retailers have been calling for an immediate reopening during what is normally their busiest quarter.In the toughest year ever for retailers, Printemps has also faced management turmoil. Its former chief executive officer, Paolo de Cesare, left the group in February just as the pandemic struck Europe. His successor, Jean-Marc Bellaiche, only took over on Oct. 1.Printemps, founded in 1865, generated sales of €1.7 billion in 2018, according to its website. Investors from Qatar bought the company in 2013 from Deutsche Bank AG and Italy’s Borletti for an undisclosed sum.Long a draw for Chinese tourists — the drivers behind the luxury industry’s stellar growth for the past two decades — Parisian department stores have suffered from volatile sales in the past five years amid terror attacks, yellow vest protests, increased online shopping and, most recently, the global virus restrictions that brought a halt to international travel.By Angelina RascouetTRENDING ON BoF1Is Hedi Slimane’s Celine Working?2Surreal Times at Prada — And in Fashion3How to Sell Subculture to the Masses4Socialite Harry Brant Found Dead5At Zegna, Pure Cinema6Why Fashion Brands Were Silent After the US Capitol Storming7Should Fashion Break Up With Big Tech?8China’s New Generation of Fashion Media Powerbrokers9Here’s Who Is Hiring in Fashion: Europe10Silvia Venturini Fendi on What Is ‘Normal’ Right Now1Should Fashion Break Up With Big Tech?2How to Navigate Contract Work in Fashion3Fashion Leaves the Trump Years Behind4Jimmy Choo’s Advice for Young Designers — and Why He’s Pro-Sneaker5Zegna Trims Hopes for Full Recovery in 20216Deal Between Topshop-Owner Arcadia and UK Retailer Next Evaporates7#BoFLIVE: Inside Farfetch’s Bid to Dominate Luxury E-Commerce8Burberry’s Retail Sales Miss Estimates9Frasers Ups Stake in Hugo Boss to Over 15 Percent10French Beauty Brands Can Now Export to China Without Testing on Animals1Should Fashion Break Up With Big Tech?2Surreal Times at Prada — And in Fashion3How to Navigate Contract Work in Fashion4Fashion Leaves the Trump Years Behind5Jimmy Choo’s Advice for Young Designers — and Why He’s Pro-Sneaker6Zegna Trims Hopes for Full Recovery in 20217Deal Between Topshop-Owner Arcadia and UK Retailer Next Evaporates8#BoFLIVE: Inside Farfetch’s Bid to Dominate Luxury E-Commerce9Burberry’s Retail Sales Miss Estimates10Frasers Ups Stake in Hugo Boss to Over 15 PercentWhat's your opinion?OrganisationsPrintempsArticle topicLuxuryAboutAbout UsMembershipsNewslettersPressMastheadContactWork With UsContributors, Tips & StoriesMedia & Press RequestsFeedbackContact UsMediaAdvertising & SponsorshipConnect with BoFThe State of Fashion 2021Site Map © 2021 The Business of Fashion.
