In addition, we ask all customers to review their mechanic so we can remove any unprofessional mechanics from the network and ensure that the standard remains high.We have a dedicated customer service team based in London to assist you and ensure your booking goes smoothly.2Who are the mechanics?The mechanics are a nationwide network of independent garages and mobile mechanics. We rigorously vet the mechanics before they join the network to ensure they have:At least 5 years work experience (average is 20 years)At least City & Guilds level 2 mechanic qualification (or better)Public liability & trade insuranceFurthermore, our users rate the mechanic after each job, meaning we quickly remove any unprofessional mechanics from the network.3Is there a warranty for your services?Yes. All repairs & services come with a 12-month warranty on both labour and parts. If there’s any defects in the workmanship we’ll work with you to get it resolved at no extra cost.4Do I pay more for the mechanic to come to me?In almost all cases, no. Collection & delivery is included in your quote. If your car isn’t drivable, and the work can’t be done by a mobile mechanic then some garages will charge a recovery fee. If this is the case, our customer service team will be in touch to let you know in advance, and you’re under no obligation to accept the increased price.5Is there a cancellation fee?You can cancel your booking with no fee up to 24 hours before the booking. If you cancel within 24 hours of the scheduled visit, then you’ll be charged a £20 fee, which will increase to £40 if the mechanic has started travelling to your location.6Can I supply my own parts?No. We don't offer a labour only service where you provide your own parts. This is because all mechanics operating in the network must offer a 12-month warranty on their repairs, and so must be able to guarantee the quality and suitability of all parts supplied.Booking1I'm not sure what's wrong, what should I do?If you don’t know what’s wrong, we recommend booking a diagnostic inspection and we’ll send a mechanic to find and fix your fault.2When can I book in for?You can book in 7 days a week, 8AM-8PM. We ask for a day's notice when making a booking, so that we can connect you with a mechanic and they can source the parts.3I can't find my repair, help!No problem! Please email us at support@clickmechanic.com with your repair details, registration and postcode and we'll send you a tailored quote.4When do I pay?You will be charged only when the mechanic has completed the work to your satisfaction, and you've given the go-ahead to invoice.5Why do you need my card details?Much like a hotel, we need your card details to reserve your booking and guarantee payment for the mechanic. You won't be charged a penny until the mechanic has completed the work to your satisfaction and you've given the go-ahead to invoice.On the day1What happens on the day?On the day the mechanic will call you to let you know exactly when they will arrive. Then they'll introduce themselves and either take your car to the garage or get on with the work you've booked.Once the work has been finished, your mechanic will explain the work they've carried out. Once you're happy and give the go-ahead to invoice, then you'll be charged by the mechanic through the ClickMechanic app and your receipt will be emailed directly to you.2Will I get a mobile mechanic or a garage?For most jobs, we'll send them to both mobile mechanics and independent garages. For jobs that can't be done at the roadside, we'll connect you to a garage, and if your car isn't drivable then we'll connect you with a mobile mechanic.3Do I need to be present for a pre-purchase inspection?No, though the mechanic will need to be able to access the car, so it’s best to liaise with the seller to ensure that they will be available.4What if the mechanic finds I need a different repair?If your mechanic attends the booking and finds that the work requested is not the correct diagnosis, the mechanic will assess the vehicle to identify the correct issue. He will then charge the booking at the cost of a diagnostic inspection and you will receive an email receipt reflecting this. If the mechanic can help with repairing the vehicle, they will also send through an additional work quote for the correct repair.5Can the mechanic do the repair by the roadside?Most repairs can be done by the mobile mechanics on our network. Some jobs will require a workshop, and if this is the case we’ll find you a garage who will collect & return your car - so there’s no need for a trip to the garage.Didn't find what you need?
