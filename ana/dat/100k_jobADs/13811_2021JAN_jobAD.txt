Or do you find it difficult to stay positive during the job interview process from applying to several jobs? Or have you found yourself getting discouraged from not getting accepted to the dream job? Here are some tips in staying positive through the interview process. You may find this process overwhelming, particularly if you are trying to get your first job, make a job change transition, or if you experienced a recent layoff.As a therapist, I work with several clients experiencing stress about applying to jobs and preparing to present themselves to a potential employer. Here are some tips to stay confident and positive in preparing for the job interview process.Practice interviewing ahead of time. Numerous times I have assisted clients with a “practice” job interview in session in order to help them practice their responses to the job interview questions. I encourage clients to practice their responses to possible job interview questions with at least one person, such as their spouse, a friend, or even adult sibling over the phone. This essentially provids practice exposure and confidence for feeling more comfortable with the job interview process. Often you can find practice questions just from googling this online or looking at HR web sites.Center and relax yourself before the interview. Rather than racing out of the door in an anxious and worried manner, take time to do a relaxation exercise or centering or grounding exercise. Do a calming breathing exercise even for five to ten minutes at home or on your commute. This can mentally and emotionally calm the body in preparation.Keep positive during the interview. Top attitudes that companies are often looking for include strong work ethic, reliability and dependability, willingness to do extra work when asked, interest and motivation in working together with others, flexibility with change, and commitment to improvement. You can communicate your interest, ability, and commitment to these attitudes. This helps demonstrate your motivation to the potential job and employer.Offer specific examples of your selling points. While anyone can say they are a good worker and bring motivation to the workplace, remember “Actions speak louder than words”. Offer examples that demonstrate your work ethic in a prior workplace or what a prior boss, coworker, or client said about your work attitude. Share a specific example of when you went the “extra mile” for our boss or a client at your prior employer. This helps to offer proof or credibility to your work and paints a clearer picture to the employer what kind of employee you are.Highlight matching you and your skills with the company’s goals. While you may clear about your goals for the job, try to highlight your knowledge and interest in the company’s goals and how you can contribute toward the company’s mission. Looking at the company’s web site ahead of time can immensely assist you with this. Research the company, company culture, and talk to other employees if possible. Get yourself into the mindset of what the company may be looking for in a motivated perspective employee.Be curious with follow-up questions. This can show your high interest in working for this specific employer. When given the opportunity to ask questions of the interviewer about the company or job, get curious! This can be used as an opportunity even more knowledge and interest in the company and position. This can also give them something to be curious about with you and wanting to come back to you.If you have been struggling with staying confidence through the job search and job interviewing process, it may be helpful to schedule an appointment with one of counselors at Symmetry Counseling.ReferencesHills, T.
