ChristiansenHere are some photos from yesterdays opening of High on Lowbrow at Galerie Wolfsen in Aalborg.As I had to try to shed some of my shyness and actually talk to people â€“ I unfortunately didnâ€™t have a lot of opportunities to document the event.

They live for hundreds of years and for each year they gain a new tail â€“ so if you see one with 7 or 9 tails you better beware.In modern China they still call a home wrecker or a dangerous woman a Huli Jing.I always like to create characters when I paint and I wanted the mood in this particular painting to be reminiscent of Twin Peaks and to have a sort of eerie melancholy. I very deliberately made my model more androgynous because I feel that it adds complexity to the story.Comments(0) https://news.myrasjoberg.com/?p=10ShareChoose site to share content onFacebook LinkedInPinterest TwitterEn lille HuldraFem Femme Fatales Posted by myra sjÃ¶bergPosted on Fri, October 26, 2012 14:17:25Her er endnu et lille maleri fra den nye serie. Det er inspireret af de skandinaviske myter og sagn om elverpiger, der fanger unge mÃ¦nd med deres hul i ryggen. I Sverige kaldes de skogsrÃ¥, i Norge huldra og man kan sjovt nok avslÃ¸re dem hvis man kan fÃ¥ Ã¸je pÃ¥ deres hale â€“ et fÃ¦llestrÃ¦k som de deler med den kinesiske Huli Jing og den japanske Kitsuneâ€¦men mere om det i nÃ¦ste opdatering:-)Here is another small painting from the new series. It is inspired by the Scandinavian myths and legends of fairy women who capture men with their hollow backs. In Sweden they are called the SkogsrÃ¥, in Norway the Huldra and you can call them out if you get a glimpse of their tail â€“ a trait which they share with the Chinese Huli Jing and the Japanese Kitsuneâ€¦but more about that in the next update:-)Comments(0) https://news.myrasjoberg.com/?p=11ShareChoose site to share content onFacebook LinkedInPinterest TwitterCategoriesStories from the Sea (1)Interview (1)Call of the Wild (2)High on Lowbrow (2)Fem Femme Fatales (5)Exhibition in Skagen (5)Fairytale Project (5)Bearely There (1)Udstilling i Hofteatret (1)En hyldest til livet (1)Fresh Strokes (1)Dreary January (1)New Portrait (1)Christmas Exhibition (2)2005-2007 (1)Recently PublishedDraugrMon, August 17, 2015 18:29:51InterviewSun, November 17, 2013 16:20:58My Little Wolf GirlsSun, October 13, 2013 20:37:39Call of the WildSun, October 06, 2013 17:13:46The Big OpeningSun, November 04, 2012 15:09:38Log in"
