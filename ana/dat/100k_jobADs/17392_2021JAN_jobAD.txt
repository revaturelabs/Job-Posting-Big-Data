For many it is a rewarding and satisfying occupation. Many find pride in helping businesses keep citizens, properties and goods safe. While it is a field with many possibilities, it’s best to also consider the wide range of responsibilities and duties, along with training necessary to effectively do the job.Consider the type of employment settings, and hazardous situations security guards work under. Also consider primary responsibilities, the need for safety awareness, firearm training, monitoring properties, and being involved in potentially dangerous situations. Security guards often monitor and protect businesses, such as apartment complexes, shopping centers, industrial complexes, offices, and hospitals.Security Guard ResponsibilitiesTheir responsibilities range from physically patrolling properties, buildings, and investigating any suspicious individuals, to completing paperwork, communicating with property owners and managers, police, fire departments, and emergency personnel. Responding to alarms and camera monitoring systems, as well as apprehending and conducting citizen arrests is also the responsibility of security officers. Checking monitoring systems, replacing broken parts, reporting damages to property owners, or checking identification of individuals is also the duty of security.Because officers work in a wide range of business situations they may have other responsibilities as well. For instance, some officers work at financial institutions, and armored guard locations, or jewelry stores, where high sums of money or expensive merchandise is kept, and is only transported in armored vehicles. In this situation, guards are normally armed, with bullet proof vests, and transport high volumes of money from one location to another, or accompany those that do. It is a potentially dangerous job, with the threat of armed robberies, and potentially life threatening situations.Officers are also responsible for keeping all safety gear in proper order, and being prepared for dangerous situations. They should know the grounds and layout of the property, investigate possible entry and exit points, and know areas where criminals could potentially hide. Knowledge of this not only keeps guards safe, but keeps properties and expensive goods from robbery and damage. It also protects the innocent from violent crime.There may also be conditions in which guards may apprehend suspects, or secure criminals until the arrival of the police officers. This may be necessary in situations involving robberies, vandalism, and violent crime. Individuals trained in security can easily apprehend individuals, and know the proper procedures for dealing with crime.Leave a ReplyName (required)Email (will not be published) (required)Search Security Guard Training HQSearch for:Security Guard TopicsSecurity Guard TrainingArmed Security Guard TrainingSecurity Guard GearSecurity Guard JobsSecurity Guard Job DescriptionSecurity Officer TrainingHow Do You Train to be a Security Guard?Most Popular ArticlesSecurity Guard Training in CaliforniaSecurity Guard Training in FloridaSecurity Guard Training in New YorkDo Security Guards Need to Go To School?Security Training Course CurriculumGuard CardPERC CardRecent PostsTop 10 Cities Hiring Security Guards NowSecurity Guard Training and Education5 Tips For Getting Hired As A Security Guard2020 Tech for the Serious Security ProfessionalSecurity Officers Vs GuardsBenefits of security guards in schoolsRobotic Security Guards On the Rise But Not Ready to Replace Human PersonnelRequirement for Becoming a Security Guard in New York City10 Safety Tips for Security Guard WorkHow Much Do School Security Guards Make?HomeAboutTerms of UseSecurity Guard Training HQPrivacy PolicyDMCA PolicyAffiliate DisclosureTerms of UseSitemapFind Training:San JoseFort LauderdaleWest Palm BeachAustinThis widget requires JavaScript to run.
