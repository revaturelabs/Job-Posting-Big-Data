The primary growth driver is innovation.Those who claim that investors should prepare for a \"new normal\" of below-average growth are missing the big picture. The U.S. is leading the most significant macroeconomic revolution since the Transportation Revolution occurred 100 years ago. Many refer to this new phenomenon as the \"tech revolution,\" but I call it the\"Steve Jobs Revolution\". This new economy will demolish the remaining walls of geographical inefficiency.(On Friday, the government reported thatfirst-quarter GDP rose 3.2%.)The stock market recently finished stage one of its recovery when the lagging indicator of employment turned positive. Now that we are in stage two of the recovery, we are noticing a new set of variables in the stock market. No longer do all stocks rise with an up market like they did during stage one. Now the real winners are emerging.Who are the winners? Any company that can effectively monetize the new way users are utilizing the Internet.

Consumers and investors alike try to avoid any unnecessary risk. The exact opposite happens in stage two of the recovery. Innovation and risk taking are rewarded.
