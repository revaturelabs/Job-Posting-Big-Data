"CSP 2006 Competition (second round) competition: execution traceTrace number 215762Some explanationsA solver is run under the control of another program named runsolver. runsolver is in charge of imposing the CPU time limit and the memory limit to the solver. It also monitors some information about the process. The trace of the execution of a solver is divided into four (or five) parts:SOLVER DATAThis is the output of the solver (stdout and stderr).Note that some very long lines in this section may be truncated by your web browser ! In such a case, you may want to use the \"Download as text\" link to get the trace as a text file.When the --timestamp option is passed to the runsolver program, each line output by the solver is prepended with a timestamp which indicates at what time the line was output by the solver. Times are relative to the start of the program, given in seconds, and are wall clock time (not CPU time).As some 'v lines' may be very long (sometimes several megabytes), the 'v line' output by your solver may be split on several lines to help limit the size of the trace recorded in the database. In any case, the exact output of your solver is preserved in a trace file.VERIFIER DATAThe output of the solver is piped to a verifier program which will search a value line \"v \" and, if found, will check that the given interpretation satisfies all constraints.CONVERSION SCRIPT DATA (Optionnal)When a conversion script is used, this section shows the messages that were output by the conversion script.WATCHER DATAThis is the informations gathered by the runsolver program. It first prints the different limits. There's a first limit on CPU time set to X seconds (see the parameters in the trace). After this time has ellapsed, runsolver sends a SIGTERM and 2 seconds later a SIGKILL to the solver. For safety, there's also another limit set to X+30 seconds which will send a SIGXPU to the solver. The last limit is on the virtual memory used by the process (see the parameters in the trace).Every ten seconds, the runsolver process fetches the content of /proc/loadavg, /proc/pid/stat and /proc/pid/statm (see man proc) and prints it as raw data. This is only recorded in case we need to investigate the behaviour of a solver. The memory used by the solver (vsize) is also given every ten seconds.When the solver exits, runsolver prints some informations such as status and time. CPU usage is the ratio CPU Time/Real Time.LAUNCHER DATAThese informations are related to the script which will launch the solver. The most important informations are the command line given to the solver, the md5sum of the different files and the dump of the /proc/cpuinfo and /proc/meminfo which provides some useful information on the computer.Solver answer on this benchmarkSolver NameAnswerCPU timeWall clock timesat4jCSP 1.7 RC BF3 ?
