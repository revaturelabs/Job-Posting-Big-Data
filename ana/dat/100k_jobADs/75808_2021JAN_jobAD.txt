Vielen Dank für Ihr Verständnis.ÜbersichtDruckenTeilenEmailFacebookLinkedInTwitterCopy LinkPhD position on \"Phenological monitoring to assess Environmental impacts on Swiss agriculture\"100%, Zurich, temporaryThe Crop Science Group at the Department of Environmental Systems Science (D-USYS) at ETH Zürich is looking for a new colleague for a doctorate/PhD to investigate environmental impacts on the phenology of crops. The intended start of the project is Q1 (Feb - April) 2021.Project backgroundSeveral threats connected to climate change are decreasing the productivity of currently established crops. While we have a conceptual understanding of the interaction of climate and growing patterns, we are in most cases unable to provide quantitative estimates of how environmental parameters impact the magnitude of phenological shifts within the landscape. Currently, phenological observations are restricted to observations of individual plants at discrete locations or using satellites that cover large regions but have limited capability to observe small individual fields in fragmented landscapes, such as those in Switzerland.Job descriptionThe prime goal of your work will be to improve our understanding of plant-environment interaction under “real world conditions” in the context of agriculture. You will analyse data from different remote sensing sources (phenocams and satellites) to investigate these interactions in phenotyping trials as well as on landscape scale. This will also include field work to sample validation data. You are expected to communicate the outcomes in peer reviewed journals and international conferences. Moreover, your PhD will be embedded into an European community of researchers through the COST action SENSECO (https://www.senseco.eu/).We offer a full time PhD position at ETH Zürich for 3 years. You will become part of the Phenofly team (www.phenofly.net) of the Crop Science Group at ETH Zürich (www.kp.ethz.ch) within the Department of Environmental Systems Science (D-USYS). This will allow you to get insights into many topics related to high-throughput field phenotyping and precision agriculture. Additionally, you may join the PhD program in Plant Sciences (https://www.plantsciences.uzh.ch/en/teaching/phdplantscience.html). The salary is according to the ETH standard pay scale.Your profileYou should possess an academic qualification (Master) in geography, remote sensing, agricultural science, ecology, plant physiology or a related field. Moreover, you should haveA background in GIS and/or remote sensing or similarExperience in programming, preferably python and/or RExperiences with spatial databases and/or big geodata (not a must but beneficial)An interest in holistic understanding of plant-environment interactionsA curious mindset and team player aptitudeWillingness to do field work (taking plant samples etc.)A well-organized, highly motivated, and independent working attitudeStrong command of English (speaking and writing) and demonstrated writing skills. Command of German is a benefitKnowledge about agriculture and/or plant-environmental interactions (not a must but beneficial)ETH ZurichETH Zurich is one of the world’s leading universities specialising in science and technology.
