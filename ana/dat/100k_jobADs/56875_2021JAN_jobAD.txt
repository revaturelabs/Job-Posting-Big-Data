Meanwhile, private equity and venture capital groups are prompting some lenders to “go public” which will prove very interesting if/when rates creep higher or refi-burnout really hits.

Net revenue was a loss of $339 million, compared with net revenue of $692 million in the prior year. Net revenue was down $1.0 billion, driven by lower net interest income, largely on lower rates, including the impact of faster prepayments on mortgage-backed securities.
