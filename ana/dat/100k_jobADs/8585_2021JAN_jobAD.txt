I got ice cream and asked get if we could get chocolate to make a nice treat and maybe watch movies she shut me down with a no faster than I could think. Hi, I met this girl about a month ago.She would call and facetime everyday like before work, after work, while she ate, and even go to sleep on the phone with me. A lot of the times her sister would jump on the phone and talk to me too. Now she only does it once a while and she told she didnt want to be on the phone as much.I callled twice back back on tuesday and she got upset and told me I was acting needy so I got mad bc shes the one that set the trend of calling eachother so I called again and told her to block me if she didnt like it so she did. She still has me blocked but messages and calls me on snapchat now. We were suppose to hang out lastnight but she felt sick and said maybe tomorrow today. She did call instead and stayed on the phone till she fell asleep.I really want to see her since its been about a week but I dont want her to keep thinking Im pushy so maybe I should let her bring it up?
