She is a Japanese woman in her early-forties whose grasp of English pronunciation and grammar is fairly good, like around advanced beginner/intermediate. For the first 6 months we just worked on improving her pronunciation, using a book aptly entitled \"English Pronunciation Exercises for Japanese Students\" (I can't remember the author's name). Since then, we have been working more and more on improving her grammar. The problem is that I have no grand strategy, or game plan, for achieving this goal other than to bounce from one grammar area to the next, using various exercises that I have printed off the internet. For a few weeks we will work on prepositions, followed by gerunds and infinitives, then maybe some work with different verb tenses, etc.Anyway, to make a long story short, can anyone recommend a good book for teaching the fundamentals of Enlish grammar to a student at the \"advanced beginner/intermediate\" level? (Ideally one that has lots of exercises too so I don't have to spend a long time tracking down appropriate exercises on the internet!).I would very much appreciate any suggestions you may have!Sincerely,MattBack to topAaronJoined: 18 Feb 2005Posts: 2Posted: Fri Feb 18, 2005 10:28 pm Post subject: ESL Matl'sHi!I would recommend Diane Larsen-Freeman's Platinum series, book 4, available from Heinle Thomson publishing. It's loaded with exercises, and embodies a sound pedagogical approach to presenting grammar. Also, The Grammar Book (by Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman) is an excellent resource for instructors looking for ideas about how to teach grammar.I'm reviewing and using both texts in my Structure of English class this semester. The insights they provide into grammar are incredible when I think about what I was taught in grade school.Best,Aaron_________________\"Life is so startling it leaves little time for anything else.\"-Emily DickinsonBack to topEddaJoined: 21 Apr 2005Posts: 4Posted: Fri Apr 22, 2005 10:07 am Post subject:Hi!
