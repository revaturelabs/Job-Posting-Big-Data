Mohd Muaz Anuar graduated with Information Technology (IT) from Asia Pacific University (APU)The Information Technology (IT) in Malaysia sector is exceptionally diverse and continues to grow. IT professionals often move between professional specialisations as their interests and expertise grow and change. Graduating with a Information Technology (IT) degree from a top private university in Malaysia allows you to choose from a wide range of careers in software development, business analysis, ITC consulting, data modelling, systems integration and network management.According to a report, the job prospects for information technology (IT) professionals in Malaysia is very good and well trained ICT professionals can earn a high salary. It is important to choose the best university in Malaysia to study the Information Technology (IT) diploma or degree course so that you can gain vital knowledge and skills to succeed in your career.A university degree in Information Technology (IT) is no longer enough to secure a job in Malaysia. Employers in Malaysia are looking for individuals with multiple skill sets. Employers today expect their employees to be able to multitask and communicate well in the English language.The gap between the demand for information and computer technology (ICT) talent and the supply of that talent is large. Study indicates that the existing situation cannot even supply half of the demand by 2020, about 500,000 human capital educated in science and technology will be needed in Malaysia. From this number, at least 30,000 graduates are required in the ICT job market.According to PIKOM, there are many jobs out there for IT graduates and there are also many jobless IT graduates. The reason for this is that there is a mismatch of the courses with the skill needed. In addition, the training that the students received was not up to the standard needed in the industry.With the increased demand for trained professionals in information technology (IT) and the many universities for students to choose from, it is important for the student to be able to choose a university that best fits his or her needs – financially, quality, educationally and career. Learn how to become a computer science professional in Malaysia by talking to knowledgeable & experienced counselors and then choosing the best private university for your degree studies. Research the education and career requirements, training and certification information and experience needed to be successful in your future career in Malaysia.The whole world is moving very fast in the area of technology and many jobs done by humans have been or will be replaced by robots and computers. Therefore, it makes sense to choose to study Information Technology or Software Engineering as the future potential for these careers are very good and the salaries are high and keep on increasing each year.What is the Salary for Software Engineering & Information Technology (IT) Professionals in Malaysia?EduSpiral helped me to find an affordable and yet world top ranked computer science university.Vickey, Diploma in IT at Multimedia University (MMU)Realising the importance of Information Technology (IT), Malaysia is also working on various plans and strategies both at domestic and international levels. With the support and favourable government policies, Malaysia is also able to keep pace with development and advancements happening at international levels.Digital Malaysia is such a strategic national programme to move the country towards the digital economy by 2020. The main objective is to promote persistent use of Information Communication Technology (ICT) in all aspects of the Malaysian economy. It will ultimately help develop a global community, increase gross national income and improve the standards of living. In short, it will empower the government, businesses and all Malaysians.The 2020 Digital Malaysia programme has targeted to produce 160,000 high-value jobs, with additional RM7,000 income per annum for 350,000 citizens. As a part of this programme, digital entrepreneurs, including Malaysian youth and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), will be some of the main target groups.According to a study conducted by MSC Malaysia on talent demand and supply, the demand for ICT professionals is growing such that annually the ICT industry would need more than 33,000 knowledge workers. By 2018, the total demand for ICT professionals is projected to be 134,438. In 2014, there was a shortage of 5,800 computer science (CS) and information technology (IT) talent workforce against the demand of 13,300.In short, the supply of computer science (CS) and information technology (IT) graduates fulfils only 60% of the demand in Malaysia. It is important for Malaysia to keep a balance in supply and demand of both fresh and experienced graduates to meet the growing demands of the IT industry.Malaysia is complementing its requirements by hiring foreign talents from India, Thailand, UK, Japan, China and the Middle East, but there is need to bridge this supply-demand gap from the domestic workforce.Currently, 59% of the Malaysian IT pool belongs to user groups such as technical helpdesk analysts, IT business analysts and computer operators. However, there is also need to produce more professionals at a creator level, such as software engineers, programmers, solution architects and designers.At present, programmers and technical support people are the most common roles in the existing workforce. Some 80% of the job vacancies require experienced professionals while the remaining 20% are for fresh graduates.The IT industry needs 107,000 experienced people and approximately 27,000 fresh graduates between 2014 and 2018. Since 2010, there has been an 8% increase in the salaries of fresh graduates and the trend shows that it will keep increasing.While multinational companies (MNCs) offer higher starting salary to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), salary increments for IT professionals are more attractive and competitive among SMEs than MNCs.The average salary of an IT professional is around RM7,000. A typical IT project manager earns a monthly salary of about RM9,000.In the coming years, the jobs that will be in high demand are software engineers, programmers, mobile application developers, SAP analysts and consultants, animators (graphics and multimedia), customer support engineers, technical support engineers, software architects, IT project managers, IT managers, data centre managers, security specialists, operations heads, network, systems and information security specialists and data analysts.Similarly, SAP, Oracle and network technologies are expected to be in huge demand as well. The IT industry is now facing a severe shortage of fresh graduates as well as experienced talents in the emerging fields of big data analytics, data science and Internet of Things.Besides their qualifications, fresh graduates need to have interpersonal communication skills – an absolute necessity these days. The job market for fresh IT graduates and experienced professionals is quite vast. IT professionals are an integral part of any organisation, not just in Malaysia but in other countries too.To produce a good quality IT talent pool, there is a need to improve the fresh graduates’ soft skills, such as communication, problem solving, presentation and leadership skills, positive attitude and good command of English.Ranstad Malaysia 2021 Market Outlook & Salary Snapshot: Information Technology (IT)Randstad IT industry salary snapshot: 2021 MalaysiaRandstad IT industry salary snapshot: MalaysiaPIKOM ICT Industry Outlook in Malaysia 2019EduSpiral provided detailed information to help me make my decision.Vincent Lim, Software Engineering Graduate, Asia Pacific University (APU)The average salary growth rate in the information and communications technology (ICT) is expected to moderate further to 3.8 per cent in 2019 in line with the lukewarm expansion of the industry in the last few years, said the National ICT Association of Malaysia (Pikom).“The overall average monthly salary in 2018 only four per cent higher than the previous year and significantly below the average annual growth rate (AAGR) of 6.7 per cent over the nine-year period of 2009-2018.The source for the figures is from the Department of Statistics of Malaysia.From 2010 to 2017, the ICT industry’s contribution to the GDP has grown from RM105.7 billion to RM178.2 billion, which is averaging 10.2% per annum.In 2017, the share of the ICT industry to GDP was 13.2% which translates to RM178.2 billion.The share of e-commerce of non-ICT industry to GDP was at 5.1% which is about RM68.9 billion.Overall, in 2017 the ICT industry contributed RM247.1 billion or 18.3% to the Malaysian economy.Woon pointed out that between 2016 and 2017 there was only a 0.1% increase in the share of the ICT industry to the economy. “Our industry is not growing as fast as our economy,” noted Woon.Average Monthly Salary in the ICT IndustryIn terms of salaries, the ICT industry pays well for talent even at the entry level. Based on figures taken from Jobstreet and from PIKOM’s own estimate, in the last 10 years of comparison, the ICT industry pay scale for five positions (entry level, junior level, senior executive, manager and senior manager), have shown a positive sign of growth.Taking the entry level as an example, in 2009 it was averaging at RM1,971 and in nine years period (in 2018), it has risen to an average of RM3,079 (for Jan – Sept) period).Education Pathway to a Top Computing Course in MalaysiaI was confused about my further studies.
