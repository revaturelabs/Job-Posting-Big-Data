Take Todd “TK” Kohlman for instance, who is a Burton Archivist. Basically taking one piece of every Burton product ever made and storing it and giving tours. With a special emphasis on Craig Kelly and Jake Burton. Sounds pretty sweet.Sample:With that entire product to choose from, do you have a particular favourite product and if so why?Jake’s prototypes are my favourites but I like the 1993 Brushie and 1994 Haakon Air a lot too. It’s really cool seeing how much time and effort Jake put into about 100 protos before even settling on one production board...Click to PYRAMID MAGAZINE for more on the Burton Archivist...View this post on InstagramJeff Brushie @jeffbrushie p.
