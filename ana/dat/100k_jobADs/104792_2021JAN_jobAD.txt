The survey of over 500 software developers actively involved with AI projects found that 51% said their AI projects were seeking to replace IT activities. This was also the category most developers (47%) were seeking to supplement.Customer support was the second most targeted category, selected by 41% of developers, while operational decision making was the second most selected job category for supplementation. The questions were constructed so that developers could make multiple selections.“It’s clear that artificial intelligence is going to displace a lot of workers,” said Janel Garvin, CEO of Evans Data. “There’s been lots of talk about robots replacing unskilled workers and this is already happening, but AI and robotics aren’t the same thing, and the jobs that AI will replace or supplement are jobs that require a lot of cognition. It’s logical that it would start within the computing itself.”The comprehensive survey also found that developers’ AI projects are most likely to support cloud-based or server-based backends for consumer research, scientific or financial modeling and research and business processes.Evans Data Corp’s Internet of AI and Big Data Survey is conducted and published twice a year and contains over 200 pages of data on such subjects as: Implications of Artificial Intelligence, Decision Making for AI and Big Data, Barriers and Challenges for Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence Concepts and Approaches, Conversational Systems and Virtual Assistants, Optimizing Hardware for AI, Real Time Events and Stream Processing, Big Data and IoT, Big Data and Cloud, Parallelism and Big Data, Advanced Analytics, Hadoop, and much more!See the complete Table of Contents and Methodology here: Table of ContentsEvans Data Corporation provides regularly updated IT industry market intelligence based on in-depth surveys of the global developer population.
