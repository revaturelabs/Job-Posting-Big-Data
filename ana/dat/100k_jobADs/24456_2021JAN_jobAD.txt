While this is often the case, it’s also important for you to understand that jobs in government related fields vary widely from one job to the next. There are many, many different types of positions available, and it is rare for two positions to look exactly the same. You should know, however, that for any government job, you will need to have a squeaky clean background, a sound mind, and a drive that will help you to beat out the competition. If you’ve got all that, then you’re ready to start looking and applying for positions. To show you just how vast and broad the field is, consider that all of these positions are government positions: police officer, FBI agent, IRS agent, postal worker, transportation security administration worker, foreign service officer, and more. So, don’t automatically assume that all government employees are mayors or congressmen. There are opportunities for people from all educational and work backgrounds, and all walks of life. The trick is simply to discover your unique skills and interests and to use them to find the perfect position for you. And, if you are looking for high-paying government entry-level jobs that come with plenty of benefits (aren’t we all?), there are certainly a few positions to consider. As a criminal investigator, for example, you could easily earn around $88,174 per year. Or, if you’d like to become an economist, you could take home a nice $94,098 per year. Engineers, financial managers, attorneys, and astronomers also tend to do quite nicely as well, but, in the end, you should choose a job based on what you want to do, not on how much it pays.External JobBBANANAS Inc/ AmeriCorpsMultiple LocationsAmeriCorps Family Resource & Referral AssociateApplyExternal JobBBANANAS Inc/ AmeriCorpsMultiple LocationsAmeriCorps Volunteer and Event CoordinatorApplyExternal JobCCaskMultiple LocationsJunior Systems Networking EngineerApplyExternal JobRRevatureMultiple LocationsJunior Software DeveloperApplyExternal JobRRevatureMultiple LocationsEntry Level Software DeveloperApplyExternal JobCCharterUPMultiple LocationsCustomer Success Account ManagerApplyExternal JobIIDEMIAMultiple LocationsPlant Manager (relocation to Sacramento, CA area required)ApplyExternal JobBBack River Search - CHURNSan Francisco, CASr. Backend EngineerApplyExternal JobBBell Falls SearchSan Francisco, CADigital Experience Software Sales Executive - West CoastApplyExternal JobTTechlink SystemsSan Francisco, CABilingual Customer Service Representative (Start ASAP)ApplyExternal JobAAgile Global SolutionsSan Francisco, CASr. Data ScientistApplyExternal JobKKimmel & AssociatesSan Francisco, CAMechanical Designer/Drafter - Wastewater & Sanitation ProjectsApplyExternal JobTThe Judge GroupMultiple LocationsMortgage Loan ProcessorApplyExternal JobSSTG InternationalSan Francisco, CAFamily Engagement SpecialistApplyExternal JobGGallant SolutionsSan Francisco, CAProject Controls AnalystApplyExternal JobCChan Zuckerberg BiohubSan Francisco, CAData ScientistApplyExternal JobCC Technologies Inc.San Francisco, CALaboratory Support SpecialistApplyExternal JobOOpen Door LegalSan Francisco, CAManaging Housing AttorneyApplyExternal JobHH.A.T.C.H.Multiple LocationsIn Home Day Program/Respite ProvidersApplyExternal JobTThe Boon Group, Inc.Multiple LocationsEmployee Benefits Sales Producer (California Region)ApplyExternal JobOOrbit FabSan Francisco, CAAvionics/Electrical EngineerApplyExternal JobOOrbit FabSan Francisco, CAPropulsions, Fluids and Thermal EngineerApplyExplore 2021 Government Entry-level JobsRemote Government Entry-level JobsColleges and Universities in San Francisco, CASan Francisco State UniversityCalifornia Culinary AcademyCinta Aveda InstituteSan Francisco Conservatory of MusicMore Related 2021 Entry-level JobsGovernment Entry-level JobsSan Francisco, CA Entry-level JobsMore 2021 Government Entry-level Jobs in Nearby CitiesGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Modesto, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Santa Maria, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Stockton, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Bakersfield, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in San Luis Obispo, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Chico, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Palm Springs, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in San Diego, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Irvine, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Sacramento, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Fairfield, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Riverside, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in West Covina, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Norwalk, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Clovis, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Orange County, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Humboldt, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Tahoe, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Inglewood, CAGovernment Entry-level Jobs in Redding, CAOther Categories of 2021 Entry-level JobsManufacturing Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAPublic Health Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAHistory Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CACosmetology Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAAccounting Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CABusiness Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAPaid Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAInternational Relations Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAGeology Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CADesign Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAReal Estate Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CARadio Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAResearch Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAPharmaceutical Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAHuman Resources Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAOn-demand Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAPhysical Therapy Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAWildlife Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CADevelopment Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CATravel Entry-level Jobs in San Francisco, CAApply to jobs.
