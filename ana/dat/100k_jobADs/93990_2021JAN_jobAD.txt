I’m really grateful because I can put a smile on someone’s face by helping them.“One of the best things is when I hear my clients acknowledge that their lives have changed for the better since receiving counselling.”What are the tasks and duties in your role?“My duties involve talking to individuals, active listening, and providing a safe place for people to discuss life challenges and explore solutions to their problems.“A typical day would involve preparing and planning for each session before talking to clients and writing notes and reports.”Are there good opportunities for counsellors?“Yes, there are good opportunities because there are many people with mental health challenges who need someone to talk to.
