Aren’t there better alternatives?More than 75% of recruiters and HR managers say big job boards don’t provide a valuable service to employers or job seekers, according to the survey by recruiter Jim Stroud.The problems: The sheer number of candidates the boards reach makes it hard to find resumes from folks that are highly qualified. Also, recruiters aren’t pleased with the “pay to post” pricing strategy most boards use.Then where are companies finding their best new employees?A referral from a current worker is still one of the most trusted recruiting tools. Almost half (46%) of white collar jobs are filled through referrals, according to a poll by the Inavero Institute for Service Research.Companies also rated the quality of referred candidates higher than applicants from any other source.Finding alternativesSome other recruiting methods companies have found success with:Specialty job boards — There are new sites appearing that offer a different take on the old job board formula — for example, some only require employers to pay after a hire is made. Also, there are boards that target specific industries, skills or demographic groups. Many companies say they get a better value out of those tools.Industry associations — Attending meetings for industry organizations in your area is a great way to network. Someone in the company can volunteer to speak at events to raise your organization’s profile in front of potential candidates.Trade publications and Web sites — Advertising in targeted publications can help increase the percentage of qualified resumes that land on your desk.Temp agencies — It’s normally quicker and cheaper to hire a temp than a permanent employee. It’s not the best option for every job, but hiring a temp can help out while you’re looking for a long-term hire — and you might even offer the temp a full-time job.Training for current employees — If you’re having trouble finding people with specific skills, the answer may be helping current workers obtain those skills through training or a tuition reimbursement program. Then, you may have an easier time filling the lower level positions after those employees are promoted.What about your organization? Have you found success using job boards?
