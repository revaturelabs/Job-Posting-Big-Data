This, it explains, will ensure that the average farmer is not left worse off.“The bill rather allows foreign seed corporations to take control of the Ghana seed industry in the name of intellectual property rights. Our agricultural sector cannot grow by relying on the importation of seeds from foreigners,” he warned.Share this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...RelatedSOURCEThomas Moore-Adingo l thebftonline.com l GhanaTAGSplanting for food and jobsFacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsAppEmailPrintTelegramPrevious articleCustoms urged to promote international tradeNext articleBetter transparency required in management of petroleum resourcesLilipearl Baaba OtooRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORCompaniesFDA urges consumers to be cautious of expired products on the marketFeaturesKarpowership renovates Ayebeng Memorial Kindergarten BlockBanking & FinanceADB supports Ekumfi Fruits and Juice Factory to expand its out-growers schemeLeave a Reply Cancel replyRecent PostsGov’t to launch interoperability of payment system JanMarkets require urgent upgrade to attract insurance coverEcobank Group named Africa’s Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility by EuromoneyAccess Bank ‘Perfect Start Promo’ helping children to learn, save and playSaving the dying textile industry…the Indian wayMost PopularFDA urges consumers to be cautious of expired products on the marketThe Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has urged the public to be cautious of what they patronise from the market for consumption as some...Karpowership renovates Ayebeng Memorial Kindergarten BlockKarpowership Ghana Company Limited has given the Ayebeng Memorial Kindergarten School located at Mamobi in Accra a facelift.
