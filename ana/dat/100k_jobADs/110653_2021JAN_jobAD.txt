The group, citing religious views and current state law, opposes any extension of benefits to domestic partnerships.Pastor Gerald Ripley issued a “fact sheet” to those in attendance, listing 14 reasons why the group opposes the change. The document said, “We believe marriage is a legally binding relationship between one man and one woman” and “a vote for domestic partner benefits is a vote against upholding the institution of marriage”.How long before these people start saying that just allowing gay people to walk around and breathe the same air is against traditional marriage?To his credit, San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro dismissed the group’s concerns as a “smokescreen for their dislike of gays and lesbians.” He smartly couches it as a business decision: Adding domestic-partner benefits will make San Antonio more competitive in terms of landing gay-friendly corporations and top LGBT talent.In other words, “It’s the economy stupid.”Benefits Domestic Partnerships san antonio TexasView Comments8Get Queerty DailySubscribe to Queerty for a daily dose of #benefits #domesticpartnerships #sanantonio stories and more8 CommentsslantyI bet they had 13 reasons ready and then bumped it up to 14 when they saw how many they had. You know how superstitious Christians are.August 31, 2011 at 11:08amJim HlavacUm, many of the crazies have already said allowing gays to walk around and breathe is against traditional marriage and well, just against everything — that’s why Bryan Brown, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry, Tony Perkins and others of this ilk are calling for making even our so much as cuddling a federal felony. And a nut job named Linda Harvey wants to just shut down all the gay bars; so we can’t even meet each other (as if we only do that in bars; the moron.)Many of these loons are quite intent to bring in the police state, arrest us all, and incarcerate us all together at an untold cost of billions of dollars and a greater cost in inhumanity — they will call this punishment — and we will call it the weirdest “Club Ted” ever devised by the folly of man.August 31, 2011 at 12:08pmTMikelIs there actually some sanity in Texas? God knows they have enough members of the LGBT community though why anyone would choose to live in Rick Perry’s benighted state is beyond me.August 31, 2011 at 12:08pmJim Hlavac@TMikel: Well, the mayor of Houston is a lesbian, married for 20+ years, and there’s some fine places all over the state — and there’s the same sort of nuts jobs in every state — to which then do you suggest we all move to? Yours?Of course, in my more radical moments I think we should all move to Florida south of Gainsville, declare it a Gay Republic, secede from the Union (oh, I think they’ll let us go,) and be done with it. Think, “Speedolandia” and the um, shape of things to come.August 31, 2011 at 1:08pmslanty@TMikel: I’ve heard from friends that some of the large cities in Texas are gay-friendly. Still, I would never go there personally.August 31, 2011 at 1:08pmJose R.Good for San Antonio and Mayor Julian Castro. They have compassion, common sense and a rational thinking mind! It’s true. My partner and I ONLY travel to areas and parts of the country that A.) recognize some benefits for same sex couples. Period. We figure if our relationship and love is not good enough for them, neither is our money. ALL our lesbian and gay friends think and do the same. They only spend where they know it’s gay friendly and at the very least forward on gay rights. And yes, we have the money to spend….the gay community has the money to spend. So the economy of the argument in favor of extending gay rights, is not a dumb one to make. For MANY gay individuals…they only shop where they are appreciated and they know it’s a welcoming gay friendly environment.New York City has us and 2 other gay couples we have as friends for an entire two weeks of spending, fun and sight seeing thanks to the rightful passage in NY.September 1, 2011 at 3:09amshipinas===== { w w w }{better—–wholesaler }{ us } =======welcome to this website—-free ship ping accept pay pal—-we provide all kinds of high quality shoes and the other thingsif you are interested in it don’t hesitate to search our websitehoping you can have a good shop ping experience— — { w w w }{better—–wholesaler }{ us } —- — —Dedicated service,the new style,believing you love itfast shipping^ ^ high quality ^ ^ don’t miss this chance ^^^^^^we sincerely hope your coming^^^as soon as possibleSeptember 1, 2011 at 5:09amjpinsatxHmmm… “The cost of extending benefits to domestic partners… is less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the city’s budget”. Do homeowners want to continue paying higher property taxes to provide free health care for the uninsured? Pastor Gerald Ripley: “We believe marriage is a legally binding relationship between one man and one woman”… “a vote for domestic partner benefits is a vote against upholding the institution of marriage”. Should government enforce the views of a particular religious group?
