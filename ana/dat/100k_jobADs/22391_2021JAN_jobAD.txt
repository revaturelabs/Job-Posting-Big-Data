Our history, our values and the people we work with combine to make Carnival a truly special place to work. The brand that we have built not only shows our commitment to each other, but the world at large.carnival ValuesOur tagline, #CHOOSEFUN, is a simple reminder that FUN is a choice that can be made every day. While it can feel effortless, having FUN doesn’t happen on its own. We could have the most beautiful ships in the world, the most exotic destinations, and the most innovative technology, but none of that matters if we don’t have the right people. Our success is driven by our amazing team members. They are the ones living and sharing the Carnival Values, bringing our brand to life and creating the FUN every day.An exciting historyThe launch of Carnival Cruise Line is a classic tale of the American Dream. Started by Ted Arison, we began operations in 1972 with a boatload of vision, a single secondhand ship and just enough fuel to make a one-way trip from Miami to San Juan. Carnival was founded on the principle that everyone deserves the right to a great vacation. Almost 50 years later, our mission remains the same – to deliver safe, fun and memorable vacations, at a great value.Fleet of Fun Shipssailing in north america,Australia and Europe+700 excitingdestinationsvisited80+ millionGuestsservedMore about Carnival CorporationOur parent company, Carnival Corporation & plc, is the world’s largest travel company visiting more than 700 ports around the world.Learn More about Carnival CorporationSafety, Sustainability and Environmental StewardshipLearn More about Safety, Sustainability and Environmental StewardshipLiving and Working with UsLearn More about Living and Working with UsThe Family of Carnival BrandsLearn MoreJob AlertsSearch by category.
