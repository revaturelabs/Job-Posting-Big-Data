The 32-year-old actress, best-known for her featured work and memorable roles in ‚ÄúClueless‚Äù and ‚ÄúGirl Interrupted‚Äù was also once engaged to Ashton Kutcher. Media is still speculating on the exact cause of her death, though asthma is rumored to have been a catalyst.Then again, asthma is also rumored to have been the convenient excuse for Murphy‚Äôs former husband, Simon Monjack‚Äôs rush to the hospital this past month after he got into a brawl in Mexico following her being fired off the set of the film ‚ÄúThe Caller.‚Äù Wherever the real truth lies,√Ç Monjack, whose nickname is ConJack was apparently not the best influence on our ‚ÄúUptown‚Äù starlet, Jewish wedding ceremonies and all.Here‚Äôs hoping wherever you are Brittany, it‚Äôs a better place than with that ConJack hubby of yours.AuthorRecent PostsbethLatest posts by beth (see all)Ilana Donna & Kabbalah - 1/20/2010	Brittany Murphy Dead at 32 (& Her Husband is a Whack Job) - 12/20/2009	Just Seen & Heard on FOX: A Majorly Anti-Semitic Seth MacFarlane - 11/8/2009	FacebookTwitterRedditPinterestEmailLinkedInWhatsAppYou may also likePopaliciousIntroducing Nicole Raviv.	by Guest PostIsralicious ‚Ä¢ Jewlicious ‚Ä¢ PopaliciousIf Seth Rogen‚Äôs Parents had just Stayed in Israel‚Ä¶	by ckIsralicious ‚Ä¢ Jewlicious ‚Ä¢ PopaliciousSeth Rogen Loves The Jews	by ckJewlicious ‚Ä¢ PopaliciousJewish Twitter Users Boycott Platform for 48 Hours to Protest...	by ckAbout the authorbethView all posts8 CommentsRob says:	12/20/2009 at 5:15 pmYep, her husband caused her to go into cardiac arrest in the shower, of course!ReplyCinthia says:	12/20/2009 at 5:17 pmOMG!!
