I gave her the sum of N2 million and she promised that the applicants have already been employed.“On September 2018, I discovered that all that she said was false and the people she collected money from, through me were disturbing me to return their money, but she kept giving series of excuses,” the unnamed petitioner said.The EFCC said that items recovered from Oyawoye’s house included Curriculum Vitae of her victims, offer letters of appointment of both the Kwara State Civil Service Commission and federal parastatals, among others.The commission said that the suspect would soon be charged to court upon conclusion of its investigations.
