This will allow you to customize your messaging so that you can provide the best affiliate product recommendations. You shouldn’t just focus on the vertical you’re in, but on the traffic sources and audience that’s visiting your site. Traffic sources may include organic, paid, social media, referral, display, email, or direct traffic. Affiliate MarketerEmail marketing: This is best in small doses. You don't want any partners sending out bulk emails to customers who aren't interested in your products or services, but with proper consideration for who's receiving the email, this could be an effective method. For instance, if you sell design tools, you might reach out to marketing agencies and ask, if they're working with a specific client on a design project, whether they might consider sending a URL from your site within the body of the email. This could help their clients leverage your tools to create higher-quality content, while giving agencies an added source of income.

While a fee can be a sign of a scam, independent contractors are responsible for their own expenses.Assistant Editor.
