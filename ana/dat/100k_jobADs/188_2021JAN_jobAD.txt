Workers in California and elsewhere wear hard hats to protect their heads and harnesses to arrest falls, but some never pause to think about the hazards of having their hands or fingers crushed. If you are one of them, you would be wise to imagine your life without your hands. A good piece of advice, regardless of the industry in which you earn your income, is never to put your hands where you cannot see them.Safety authorities say approximately 125,000 workers nationwide suffer caught-in or crushed-by injuries each year. This number includes all industries, from construction sites to offices and big-rig operators.Here’s how to protect your handsIf you become familiar with the various hazards in your workplace that could cause cuts, bruises and mangled or amputation injuries to your hands, you can take the necessary precautions to mitigate the risks. The term used for these hazards is pinch points, referring to anything that involves physical forces that can catch, crush or pull in body parts.Assess the risks and remain focusedRisk assessment is crucial before the start of any task. If you identify potential dangers, you can plan the necessary steps to avoid crushing injuries. Be aware that losing focus can lead to losing a hand or several fingers. While daydreaming, participating in horseplay or multitasking, you could deal with distractions and be a victim of one of those workplace accidents that happen in the blink of an eye.Mind what you wear to workWhen you dress for work, avoid loose or too-long sleeves and pants that could catch in pinch points. If you wear protective gloves, make sure they fit tightly. Dangling jewelry and long hair pose the same risks, and it is a good idea to tuck ponytails and braids into clothing.Common crush hazardsAlong with vehicles, forklifts and machinery, other crush hazards exist in all work sites. Take care in the following situations:Be alert when you use powered doors or other powered equipment. Avoid placing any body part between, under or against energized equipment.Beware of catching your hands in file drawers and doors.Before lifting or carrying heavy crates, boxes or other heavy objects, test the weight. Ask for help rather than risking the pinching of your fingers and toes if you should accidentally drop the object or if it slips when you put it down.Always make use of available material-handling devices when you move heavy or bulky objects.Be alert when you use machinery with rotating shafts, rollers, conveyors or other moving parts.Make sure to de-energize machines before reaching in to remove blockages or when you repair or maintain them.You can refuse to work with machinery that lacks the necessary guards. The same applies when barriers that are necessary to prevent contact with moving parts are damaged.You might identify even more pinch point hazards that are unique to your job.How will you cope after a catastrophic injury?Your hands are irreplaceable, and losing even one finger can prevent you from returning to the same occupation. Fortunately, the California workers’ compensation insurance program offers extensive benefits for victims of work-related injuries. An experienced workers’ compensation attorney can assist with the navigation of a benefits claim to ensure you receive benefits to cover vocational training along with compensation for medical expenses and lost wages.FacebookTwitterLinkedInSearch for:CategoriesBrain Injuries (2)Car Accidents (15)Construction Workers Accidents (13)Employee Rights (35)Truck Accidents (5)Workers' Compensation (33)Workplace Accidents (36)Workplace Injuries (67)Wrongful Death (2)ArchivesJanuary 2021 (1)December 2020 (1)November 2020 (1)October 2020 (1)September 2020 (1)August 2020 (5)July 2020 (5)June 2020 (9)May 2020 (6)April 2020 (7)March 2020 (6)February 2020 (6)January 2020 (7)December 2019 (7)November 2019 (6)October 2019 (7)September 2019 (7)August 2019 (7)July 2019 (8)June 2019 (5)May 2019 (8)April 2019 (6)March 2019 (5)February 2019 (5)January 2019 (10)December 2018 (4)November 2018 (1)October 2018 (10)September 2018 (4)August 2018 (6)July 2018 (5)June 2018 (5)May 2018 (6)April 2018 (5)March 2018 (5)February 2018 (5)January 2018 (7)December 2017 (6)November 2017 (5)October 2017 (8)September 2017 (6)August 2017 (10)July 2017 (1)June 2017 (2)Recent PostsWhy are workers’ compensation claims denied?What to do in the immediate aftermath of a workplace injuryIs chronic pain covered by workers’ compensation?How to respond to a denied workers’ compensation claimHow to protect your workers’ compensation claimSubscribe To This Blog’s FeedContact The FirmEmail Us For a ResponsePHONE213-986-8498FollowFollowFollowFollowLaw Offices of Anthony Choe3700 Wilshire BlvdSuite 260Los Angeles, CA 90010Los Angeles Law Office MapReview Us© 2021 Law Offices of Anthony Choe.
