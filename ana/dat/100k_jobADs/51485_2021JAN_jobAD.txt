He just flat out lied. He lied and he lied and he lied. And he embellished. So did two people on “the right” who are frequently on FOX News, and you’ll read more about them, below.To take the temperature of what a big deal this is, #BrianWilliamsMisremembers has been among the top Twitter hashtags in the United States since last night. (I’ll post some of my tweets about it a little later (follow me on Twitter).) NBC should have immediately fired Williams. But the network not only didn’t fire him, they’ve kept him in his anchor seat. This is a man for whom the network regularly runs commercials (complete with voice-overs from his Hollywood pal, Michael Douglas) declaring that Williams is a man we can trust, that he’s accurate, etc. PUH-LEEZE. I never believed that crap. In fact, the only thing I believed on NBC News were the endless biased, incestuous stories about how Williams’ daughter Allison got the job in NBC’s live broadcast of “Peter Pan” all because of her incredible talent. Oh, wait, I don’t think I bought that story, either.But, now, Williams has been caught in a big lie–a lie he told more than once on the air, on the newscast. A lie that he kept embellishing ever more each time he told it, including on “Late Night With David Letterman.” The guy should resign. Or, better yet, NBC News should fire him. Immediately.But Williams isn’t the only one.And you might say, “Can you imagine if someone at FOX News lied like this? The media would be all over it, and they’d be fired.” But you would be wrong.FOX News paid contributor and syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin and phony “terrorism expert” “Brigitte Gabriel,” whose real name is Hanan Kahwaji Tudor and is also frequently on FOX News, both made up stories–big lies–in order to get noticed and make gazillions.They Also “MisRemembered”: Michelle Fraudkin, Hanan Kahwaji Tudor a/k/a “Brigitte Gabriel”Malkin made a name for herself through a column in which she completely fabricated a story about a Senator calling her, sight unseen, and asking her to move in with him when she was a college intern. The story was obviously fake. She completely made it up to get attention at a time when she couldn’t get noticed or even arrested. And it worked. She not only wrote a column containing the apocryphal story–with her syndicator Creators never demanding any proof–but she then repeated it on C-SPAN, declining to name the fictional Congressman because he never existed and it never happened. She credited that phony story with getting her a contract with FOX News.At the time, Congressman Gary Condit was under fire for his affair with the missing (and we now know, dead) Chandra Levy. Also at that time, Malkin couldn’t get anyone to pay attention to her, couldn’t get any TV appearances. The overly solicitous Malkin repeatedly e-mailed me, like a weird stalker fan, every time I was on FOX News talking about a column I wrote about the Congressman I once worked for, Donald “Buz” Lukens, who was arrested and prosecuted for having sex with an underage prostitute. And, so, “All About Eve”-style, she suddenly “remembered” a story that never happened and wrote a column about it. The column was so hard to believe that even one of her editors told me it was obviously fabricated. The column was about how she was looking for housing in Washington, DC while in college when she planned to be an intern there, the following summer. The phantom politician purportedly magically obtained Malkin’s phone number at random from her college and called her, sight unseen, asking her to live with him for the summer. The story is so clearly fantasy that she refuses to name this non-existent person. Here’s a tip: when a story defies credulity, it’s because it isn’t credible.But like I said, it worked. Fake it ’til ya make it. While FOX News will call Williams on it–as the network did repeatedly yesterday and today, it won’t ever do the same for Fraudkin. Ditto for “Gabriel” a/k/a Kahwaji Tudor.“Brigitte Gabriel” a/k/a Hanan Kahwaji Tudor, a Palestinian Muslim who parades as a Lebanese Maronite Christian, has built a post-9/11 career making up fanciful stories. Ghostwriters wrote a whole book filled with the fake stories, some of which have already been disproven and many of which are obviously phony to anyone with any common sense and even a modicum of critical thinking skills. As with Malkin, proof was never demanded for any of her fanciful fairy tales. Whatever she wrote and claimed, no matter how impossible, was gullibly accepted as truth. And she kept embellishing, just like Brian Williams. The editors of “her” books never did any fact-checking nor did they do a shred of work to verify her claims. And, yet, many demand that critics disprove her rake stories which she never proved were true in the first place.On this site, I’ve already debunked “Gabriel”/Kahwaji Tudor’s new false claim that she was a “Palestinian human shield,” a charade presented on the air as fact by FOX News’ Megyn Kelly without an iota of fact-checking. And I’ll be debunking a lot more of her fakery at some point in the future. Stay tuned.And, given all this, FOX News and NBC News, are morally equivalent in their lack of credibility. Fake and balanced.Note that while liberal media figure Brian Williams has been fact-checked and debunked, Malkin and Tudor haven’t been. Williams should be out of a job, and if the media storm about his big lie continues along with social media mockery of his “misremembering” claim, he may soon be terminated from the NBC anchor chair. This might not just go away, as he and NBC wish it would. You can’t just sweep away and under the rug continuous lies on the air as “misremembering.”Williams was outed by rightfully angry American troops, upset that Williams claimed to be on the helo with them when he wasn’t. But a non-existent Congressman she made up can never out Michelle Fraudkin. And non-existent Palestinians who never used Hanan Tudor as a human shield won’t out her either.Still, their lies and con artistry don’t relieve you or FOX News from using critical thinking skills and saying, hmmm . . . how can that be true?There are some things–many things–that defy reason and logic. And the facts.Tags: Brian Williams, Brian Williams Lie, Brian Williams Lied, Brian Williams Misremembered, Brigitte Gabriel, Hanan Kahwaji, Hanan Kahwaji Tudor, Michelle Malkin, NBC NewsPosted in Blog Posts34 Comments »34 ResponsesWhat a shame that unvarnished truth has no place in this world. That’s why Michelle Fraudkin was welcomed in to the club, and you were kicked out. The human race is going to pay a terrible price for our constant denial and obfuscation.We are witnessing every day, the voluntary, willful and quite unfortunate desire of the human race to commit mass suicide. Thank God He truly exists, and will come again some day to clean up the gargantuan mess we are about to make, . . .yet again.I love you, Debbie. Keep on truckin’.Alfredo from Puerto Rico on February 5, 2015 at 12:52 pmReplyThe only time I see Brian Williams is when somebody mashes his words from Nightly News together to make it sound like he’s rapping. So I never knew he claimed to have been shot down. But I would have called BS on it. If that had REALLY happened, it would have been one of the top stories, not some little anecdote to tell during interviews. You’ve covered the Malkin and “Gabriel” issues before but the difference with them is that they’re not the anchors of one of the huge network nightly news broadcasts. Williams can never do a tough interview with anyone again. Can you imagine him accusing the person of lying? Their response would almost certainly be “well maybe I was wrong but at least I didn’t disrespect our service members by saying I was shot down in combat when I knew damn well I wasn’t.”Sean M on February 5, 2015 at 12:57 pmReplyI think they should keep Brian Williams and not fire him. What if he was replaced by Al Sharpton?Little Al on February 5, 2015 at 2:15 pmReplyJon Stewart was reportedly offered a ton of money to host Meet the Press. Now that he’s left the Daily Show, maybe NBC will want that master of the fake news format to host the show few still believe. At least funnier than the hate-filled buffoon, Sharpton.Raymond in DC on February 10, 2015 at 11:49 pmReplyWish people would wake up and realize it’s not as bad as they think it is. It’s worse.Speaking of that where is Skzion these days?socally on February 5, 2015 at 2:19 pmReplyI read that the pompous, unfunny, sexual-harraser, Letterman called Williams a “war hero.” Nauseating.DS_ROCKS! on February 5, 2015 at 3:02 pmReplyHey, these are small fibs compared to the fabrications Barack Obama, or whatever his real name is, used to become POTUS. They all do it.

Top media personalities (I refuse to call them reporters) aren’t where they are because they’re good at telling the truth. On the contrary, there are there because they are good at LYING when they asked to lie. They have to be better at lying, in fact, than even politicians.Why is lying a requirement for holding a top media personality position like Brian Williams holds? The reason for this is that when national events occur, the media needs to speak with one authoritative voice. You can’t have one network saying one thing and another network saying something entirely different. This would cause people to think and ask questions. Thus, when any major national story breaks, ALL media outlets of prominence fall in line. Sure they have their petty political differences, so one network might seem more “conservative” and another more “liberal,” but that is trivial compared to the unified message they’re delivering.And who makes this unified national message? The CIA is most important an influential source of the official message that is communicated. That official message is frequently a lie, but they media personalities have to present those lies convincingly. The next time a major world event happens, immediately channel surf and you will see that I’m absolutely correct and that all media personalities are basically communicating exactly the same message and version of “reality.”Now, if you’re a Brian Williams, a Peter Jennings, a Walter Cronkite, or a Dan Rather, you’ve got to be a first calls liar. You know that’s your job. But because you’re basically being asked to lie all of the time on major world events, it seems perfectly reasonable to also lie about yourself if that helps further your career or get you more attention, right? Of course it does and you can easily rationalize that one lie isn’t much worse than all the other lies you’ve told.But, of course, the important rule is don’t get caught lying. That is the real sin.I hope this explanation helps give you a better understanding of the media and how it works. “The CIA owns everyone of any significance in the major media.”–Former CIA Director William ColbyRalph Adamo on February 5, 2015 at 4:05 pmReplyI think Williams, as a flaming Libtard as well as seeing the Obola-Putin pathological lying administration in motion, thought he could get away with such prevarication & obfuscation. Why the hell not, he thought. Obola-Putin can lie with gusto & nobody gives a toss about it. I’m glad he was called out. He won’t be fired though. He’s protected. If Americans had morals, values, character & integrity this would NOT stand. But it will because we’re in the Kardashian zeitgeist, so sad to say.Thanks for calling out his annoying, large-sized mouth daughter as well. I hope she goes away soon. Maybe she can head an nepotism organization?As for Brigitte Gabriel, I’m annoyed that no ones calls her out on the truth you relay. Conservative show after Conservative show props her up. I never listen to a word she says. If I did, I wouldn’t hate the “Patriots” so much and I’d be their biggest fan. Also, the yin to her yang is Walid Shoebat. Another one propped up. However, I was intrigued by his theory that Chris Kyle’s killer is a Mooooooslim sympathizer. More so because I SHOULD have thought that on my own but I have been off my game in regards to politics and Islam. I shouldn’t be but that is the truth.Thanks for the info on Fraudkin. I never listen to her anymore because what I have learned on this site.Please note everybody…we are in the age where the truth-tellers are ignored and the lying sacks of craps are propped up. I’m completely disgusted by it all.S: As I’ve noted on this site, Walid Shoebat, with whom she used to go on a speaking tour, is a complete con artist and grifter, just like her. He was exposed by myself and by CNN. If he was such a “terrorism expert,” why did he rip off my work? And video shows him telling CNN he bombed a bank and FOX News that he didn’t bomb the bank. Good con artists at least get their stories straight. DSSkunky on February 5, 2015 at 4:26 pmReplyyes I think sothatsallfolks on February 5, 2015 at 5:09 pmReplyEverybody who’s anybody rips off your work Debbie. Aren’t you a team player?Did CNN consult you for the hit on him or was it synchronicity?Or is there just some ambiguity in the way you phrased your statement which makes it hard for me to be certain without knowing your intention?thatsallfolks on February 5, 2015 at 5:14 pmReplyCause CNN doesn’t just arbitrarily go after people without an agendathatsallfolks on February 5, 2015 at 5:15 pmReplyThe fact that good old CNN did the take down is probably one of the least convincing sides to this story unless you actually think of them as a news network.thatsallfolks on February 5, 2015 at 5:17 pmReplyI prefer to think them as Al Jazeera light which in fact they arethatsallfolks on February 5, 2015 at 5:21 pmReplyCNN exposé which was incredibly painful to sit through has two main points that are actually worth listening to.Lack of arrest records and lack of records for bomb.Funding issues not in terms speaking engagements which is irrelevant but with regard to charities.Those are real issues which I would like to know more about.The rest of the baloney is the usual CNN stuff.I have to admit Shoebat didn’t hold up well in the interviews.Regardless, what happened here is that CNN changed the narrative walking lockstep with Obama changing the narrative on counter terrorism.That’s what happened and that’s why they did exposé. Whether or not Shoebat is legit is irrelevant to them or they would have checked him out properly before using him themselves.thatsallfolks on February 5, 2015 at 6:16 pmReplyBrian Williams is old enough to retire at this point, and should. He has no credibility left.Michelle Malkin, according to Debbie, commenced her career by pushing a fake harassment story.Hanan Kahwaji Tudor is an odd screeching creature that should not be allowed outside after dark.Worry on February 5, 2015 at 7:48 pmReplyHer only problem is that she has a little too much respect for the emotional hysteria of Western progressives who loath her in measured cadence.If you want to hear chains rattle then listen to their siren song. It will put you to sleep.thatsallfolks on February 5, 2015 at 9:23 pmReplyWhoa, the make-up people at FOX-Snooze really earn their pay when they work on Tudor. I wouldn’t do her with someone else’s….corncoleo on February 5, 2015 at 9:46 pmReplyYeah rightthatsallfolks on February 6, 2015 at 9:21 amReplyDo not forget the current Massachusetts senator warren. She lied about being part Indian. Also the current senator from Connecticut blumenthal. He was also attorney general and lied about being in Vietnam. Funny that the liberal news hi light any republican or conservaticpve mistake. Yet these clowns get a free pass.Glen benjamin on February 5, 2015 at 11:12 pmReplyWilliams is only doing what the muslims he admires have taught him- Taqiyya!! Hilary Clinton did something similar. Is this story breaking now to have some impact on 2016? Why is it in “the news” now at all. Sorry, but I have no trust in media.And ……Is there ANY muslim or ex-muslim that is honestly speaking out truthfully for sanity and reason? That simpering Jasser fellow is not sincere. Ever see him questioned about Israel? He tries to keep smiling but hate sparks out of his eyes. There was a lady psychiatrist, I think named “Wafa.”And Hirsi.My point is, if there truly are “moderate muslims” or even ex-muslims it is very difficult to ever trust them. There is no reason to trust networks or cable news. And, I must include FOX. Their star, Megan Kelly, used to be on in the daytine reciting left-wing ignorant lines. Now, I am supposed to believe she is conservative.Crazycatkid on February 6, 2015 at 7:56 amReply….Just announced by a spokespimp for NBC “News.” “There will be no disciplinary action taken regarding Mr. Williams.” Is anyone surprised?Victoryman on February 6, 2015 at 10:59 amReplyIf I remember correctly, Biden was found to have plagiarized a number of speeches/writings while a US SenatorJoel on February 6, 2015 at 11:03 amReplyI haven’t watched news, network or otherwise, for over 30 years. Somehow I’m informed on the issues. Go figure. To point:NBC is the network of fraud and fake stories (GM truck fires and Zimmerman 911 tapes) so they deserve each other. I could case less if he’s fired, promoted or sent to Jupiter. They are all teleprompter readers, nothing more. But this is nothing new. The revered Walter Cronkite lied through his baggy pants about Vietnam and the TET offensive.JeffT on February 6, 2015 at 11:52 amReply“charade presented on the air as fact by FOX News’ Megyn Kelly without an iota of fact-checking.

Cant wait….PN on February 6, 2015 at 1:26 pmReplyThis sort of thing has been going on for along time. For instance, Jack Webb got away for decades claiming that he flew airplanes during World War II while in reality he was a member of he typing pool. It was not until 2 decades after he passed away in 1982w, that one of his biographers uncovered the truth about the man behind Sgt. Friday.Charles Rector on February 8, 2015 at 11:06 amReplyI wrote very politely years ago to Malkin that one of the sites on her blogroll “VDARE” was loaded with racists and anti-Semites. VDARE is a hardcore paleocon with columns by Jew haters such as the demented Paul Craig Roberts and Justin Raimondo. Malkin wrote back a nasty email to me. She is so stupid that she does not realize that to that crowd she would always be a useful idiot since they only like people of Northern European Protestant background.Repeat on February 8, 2015 at 7:28 pmReplyThis shit is one of the many, many reasons I do not watch the news or read the paper. Bunch of numbskulls, regurgitating idiotic nonsense that has been manipulated and sterilized. I pay attention to the morning traffic, weather, the stock market, gun laws, animal rights, and my home/family health and safety. Everything else is just noise.HLC on February 11, 2015 at 10:51 amReplyLeave a Reply for Glen benjaminClick here to cancel reply.Name *Email * (won't be published)Website* denotes required fieldSubmit CommentSponsor My Work!Click to become a sponsor!AdvertisementCopyright 2000–2017 www.debbieschlussel.com"
