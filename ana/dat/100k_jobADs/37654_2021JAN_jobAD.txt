If you lose 25% of staff will you need as many slots in the future?“It is a challenge I will be honest with you, but don’t forget this is across the British Airways group, so British Airways has a significant operation at London City, at Gatwick and at other airports so it’s not just about Heathrow. But clearly we would like to for the future, secure all of the slots that we currently have at Heathrow. That may not be possible. It may require us to leave some of the slots that we don’t intend to operate, but we would like to see, given that slots at Heathrow tend to be at a premium, we’d like to see if we can retain all of those. If we can’t because the business can’t afford to do so that will be a regrettable decision, but it just puts into context the crisis we are facing today.”So he did not directly say he would pull out of Gatwick, but he appears to suggest he would rather lose Gatwick and London City operations before losing a single Heathrow slot.ReplyGS-AlphaView Public ProfileFind More Posts by GS-Alpha6th Jun 2020, 08:38#743 (permalink)Dannyboy39Join Date: Dec 2011Location: UKPosts: 705Quote:Originally Posted by HZ123Possible cessation of BA op at LGW!.I believe in a leaked BA LGW 1 st May memo it was stated 'there is no certainty as to when or if these services can or will return'.BA have 74 routes accounting for 17% of LGW capacity being about 20% of all operatrions at Gatwick.

Understandably, the likes of Wizz want some certainty in their operations rather than be kicked out when the market picks up.Watching Wizz in the background to all of the other airlines floundering is quite something... it's almost as if they're in a parallel universe to everyone else.I don't know how, but there needs to be a better mechanism of allocating slots - all the current grandfathering system does is protect the status quo and impedes competition.ReplyDannyboy39View Public ProfileFind More Posts by Dannyboy396th Jun 2020, 08:55#744 (permalink)BirdmanBerryJoin Date: Mar 2013Location: Cheltenham, UKPosts: 126With regards redundancy, you cannot make a position redundant only to employ again in the exact same job role, the role has to have been diminished and a new different role created. For example, if you have a business with a van driver/logistics only position, you can make that position redundant but you could re-employ them (on different terms as they can re-apply) or someone else with a different role, such as warehouse and logistics.So how you can make a Captain redundant and re-employ them on reduced terms I'm not sure as you can't them make them Captain and cabin crew, the position wouldn't allow it.ReplyBirdmanBerryView Public ProfileFind More Posts by BirdmanBerry6th Jun 2020, 09:14#745 (permalink)Dannyboy39Join Date: Dec 2011Location: UKPosts: 705Welcome to the world of Aircraft Managers, Aircraft Assistant Managers and Aircraft Operating Engineers!ReplyDannyboy39View Public ProfileFind More Posts by Dannyboy396th Jun 2020, 10:20#746 (permalink)Phantom4Join Date: Oct 2005Location: ukPosts: 87From IAG memo.ReAcquistion of Air Europa.‘Transfers IAGs Madrid hub into a true rival to Europe’s four largest hubs,Amsterdam,Frankfurt London Heathrowand Paris Charles De Gaulle.Reestablishes IAG as a leader in the highly attractive Europe to Latin America and Caribbean market.’Spanish Practice erosion of British AirwaysReplyPhantom4View Public ProfileFind More Posts by Phantom46th Jun 2020, 12:24#747 (permalink)777JRMJoin Date: Mar 2014Location: UKPosts: 123Quote:Originally Posted by Phantom4From IAG memo.ReAcquistion of Air Europa.‘Transfers IAGs Madrid hub into a true rival to Europe’s four largest hubs,Amsterdam,Frankfurt London Heathrowand Paris Charles De Gaulle.Reestablishes IAG as a leader in the highly attractive Europe to Latin America and Caribbean market.’Spanish Practice erosion of British AirwaysYet Spanish law offers greater protection (than UK) for employees’ rights?Reply777JRMView Public ProfileFind More Posts by 777JRM6th Jun 2020, 12:37#748 (permalink)TURINJoin Date: Feb 2002Location: UKAge: 55Posts: 2,907Quote:Originally Posted by The Fosswhere has it been announced that the plan is to pull out of Gatwick? The cost base there is already relatively low. And how would they use LHR crew on ‘miserly pay and conditions’? If they are LHR crew they will be on the LHR pay scales, and therefore more expensive than current BA LGW crew...https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52489013ReplyTURINView Public ProfileFind More Posts by TURIN6th Jun 2020, 12:42#749 (permalink)ILS27LEFTJoin Date: Aug 2002Location: EuropePosts: 3Quote:Originally Posted by Phantom4From IAG memo.ReAcquistion of Air Europa.‘Transfers IAGs Madrid hub into a true rival to Europe’s four largest hubs,Amsterdam,Frankfurt London Heathrowand Paris Charles De Gaulle.Reestablishes IAG as a leader in the highly attractive Europe to Latin America and Caribbean market.’Spanish Practice erosion of British AirwaysSo IAG, which is the Spanish owner of the UK national carrier BA, is investing money to make MAD a true rival of LHR (which means IB, Vueling etc vs BA). It is all pretty clear.Is the UK government going to allow this?Does the UK Gov want to protect the UK economy and UK jobs?I genuinely believe the UK Gov needs to move quickly to avoid permanent damage to the flag carrier and therefore to the UK Economy.ReplyILS27LEFTView Public ProfileFind More Posts by ILS27LEFT6th Jun 2020, 13:08#750 (permalink)bucket_and_spadeJoin Date: Mar 2008Location: UKPosts: 329LGW closure story above is over a month old.

The threat to permenantly close LGW was one of the opening salvos in BA's carefully orchestrated press release. Frightened the bejesus out of everyone. It's a common tactic, threaten the worst then come back with a really bad offer thats not as bad but achieves the company goal.ReplyTURINView Public ProfileFind More Posts by TURIN6th Jun 2020, 14:13#752 (permalink)Jet IIJoin Date: Jan 2002Location: West CountryPosts: 1,266Quote:Originally Posted by 777JRMYet Spanish law offers greater protection (than UK) for employees’ rights?Which might explain why unemployment in Spain is over 3 times worse than the UK - businesses will do everything to avoid recruiting people who they may not be able to get rid of easily in a downturn.ReplyJet IIView Public ProfileFind More Posts by Jet II6th Jun 2020, 14:16#753 (permalink)Jet IIJoin Date: Jan 2002Location: West CountryPosts: 1,266Quote:Originally Posted by ILS27LEFTSo IAG, which is the Spanish owner of the UK national carrier BA, is investing money to make MAD a true rival of LHR (which means IB, Vueling etc vs BA).

How are individual OpCo cash reserves contributed? Whilst they may say an acquisition by another OpCo has no effect on the others, I do not believe it for one moment. The Spanish companies have long hated the contributions BA makes towards its NAPS pension deficit for instance, and I am sure that was a big driver behind its closure a few years back.ReplyGS-AlphaView Public ProfileFind More Posts by GS-Alpha6th Jun 2020, 14:44#755 (permalink)TURINJoin Date: Feb 2002Location: UKAge: 55Posts: 2,907Quote:Originally Posted by Jet IIWW covered this in his interview on Sky.

Surely this BA redundancy plan is just management making their own commercial decisions. Sorry, I don't buy it. If IAG are not involved with this Iberia purchase, a major financial transaction by any measure, then what is the point of them being there.
