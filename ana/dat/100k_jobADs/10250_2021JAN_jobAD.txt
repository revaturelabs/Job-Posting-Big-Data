He said he doesn't trust Lasik, but recommended something called Orthokeratology, or \"Ortho-K\". I'm looking into it- it is basically overnight vision correction, where you sleep in hard contacts, so that your eyes re-shape. For some, just one overnight grants great vision. For others, it takes a few nights. Worth a shot over risky Lasik!Hmmm, Ortho K, sounds like some cereal. I will definitely check it out. Did you buy the contacts? How much are they about??CBP exam in SD 12/15/10NOR passed 1/25/11Changed GEO to SWB 6/25/11Fingerprint cards 11/12/11PFT1 12/15/11VBT/SI 1/26/12VBT/SI result eligible 1/31/12LASIK surgery 1/31/12Met BI investigator 3/13/12Qualifications cleared 5/11/12Drug test 7/18/12CommentPostCancelAshan646Forum MemberJoin Date: Apr 2010Posts: 150ShareTweet#2827701-14-2012, 02:25 PM@66 they forgot to do my x ray test at the clinic.

If so, was it hard? Did you learn enough to carry on a conversation in Spanish?Has anyone ever failed the course?According to my EOD letter, if a new hire fails the course, they can request to be assigned to a different port that doesn't require Spanish but it is up CBP to decide what will happen. What do you think CBP would do in that situation? Send the officer to a port that needs a new CBPO or get rid of the officer?Hey don't sweat this Spanish training. It's super easy from what I hear. Only 1 person has ever failed it. I hear it's more like a vacation after FLETC. I personally never taken this course but I Know people that have.CommentPostCancelAesco84Forum MemberJoin Date: Dec 2011Posts: 63ShareTweet#2828201-14-2012, 06:38 PMOriginally posted by Rocafella0226!

This was why my eye and hearing test was scheduled at a different clinic. CHS arranged and paid for it. I had to pay for the follow ups due to the clinic screwing them up.CommentPostCancelhtcguy1Forum MemberJoin Date: Sep 2011Posts: 102ShareTweet#2828501-14-2012, 09:14 PMquick question....is the PFT1 a 1 shot oppertunity? or can you try again if you fail a part?CommentPostCancel66PonyForum MemberJoin Date: Jul 2011Posts: 123ShareTweet#2828601-14-2012, 10:19 PMAfter an 11 hour work day yesterday and a 12 hour today I finally got a chance to check my email after getting home. Waiting for me was an email containing MORE good news! I received a zip file of forms from MHC to complete and fax back. The file contained a PFT2 Preference form, Drivers License Agreement, Probationary Period form and Tentative Offer Acceptance. Hopefully this infers even better things to come soon!CommentPostCancelIamWolfForum MemberJoin Date: Aug 2011Posts: 393ShareTweet#2828701-14-2012, 10:29 PMOriginally posted by mandarrin View Postyea, I heard a lot of different stories about how the background would take months, so I though that when they transferred me to the scheduling unit they would call me real quit, but almost a month now and still no call, so I guess I just have to wait. anyway I'm sure you'll get your TSL soon enough, and don't pay attention to the negative comments and advise, just the positive ones. btw I was born in Venezuela. how about you?Thanks for the advice, Mandarrin. I'll be sure to remember those words. I was born in Brazil. I know the US doesn't have a necessarily ideal relationship with Brazil but you're from Venezuela! You can't get much worse than Chavez! lol I'm praying to God that my process goes along somewhat as quick as yours. And that is awesome you were already transferred to the scheduling unit! I still don't even have CASS... :/ This is making me realize how impatient I am... lol\"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.
