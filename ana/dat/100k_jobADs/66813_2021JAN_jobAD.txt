Each quarter, Scholars rotate to a new department where they assist staff with non-clinical tasks and support with key initiatives targeted to improve the patient experience.ApplyAll applicants must complete an online application, in-person interview, 30 hours of training and are required to pass two exams before becoming Health Scholars.
