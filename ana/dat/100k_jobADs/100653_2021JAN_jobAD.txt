Day by day, I struggled with a lack of motivation and drifting in a sense of meaninglessness.This was huge for me.I‚Äôve always prided myself on being someone who can create meaning in whatever I do ‚Äî Reframe! Change your perspective! Try a new challenge!Positive psychology got me nowhere though. I couldn‚Äôt get out of that sinking, dead feeling in my heart no matter what I tried.I felt like an utter failure in not being able to create purpose, and at the risk of sounding melodramatic, my very self-concept was threatened.I sank deeper.This went on for 2 years. I knew something had to change ‚Äî but to what?So why not get another job instead of taking a break?Because the truth is, I have no idea what I want to do.This may sound odd, but I don‚Äôt actually know what I like or what I‚Äôm good at.Without that to guide me, I was looking at jobs that I thought I could get, rather than what I actually wanted to do.When I got off a call with a recruiter from another travel company feeling frustrated, it dawned on me that I wasn‚Äôt exploring anything new. Same shit, different day.And so I cancelled LinkedIn premium and stopped creeping on job postings.Before deciding what‚Äôs next, I need to know what I‚Äôm looking for.And to do so, I have to first answer two questions.1. Who is Sonia?2. What problems do I want to struggle for in this world?I‚Äôve spent a great deal of my life doing things I think I should do, not necessarily what I want to do.Joining Skyscanner is probably a good example.Here were my top 3 reasons:Tech is the next big thing! It‚Äôs a sexy brand! It meets the minimum requirement for a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù salary!You might have noticed that none of these reasons actually come from me.I want to change this, and while there may be different ways to arrive at these answers, taking 12 months off was the best I came up with.This is how big the questions feel.One does not simply resign. I prepared for over a year.Practical stuff like getting finances in order, making lifestyle changes to reduce spending, crunching data to come up with a realistic budget.More importantly, managing my anxiety, committing to meditation practice, introspecting.That said, I still wanted to see if I could make it work at Skyscanner and took on an entirely new role in my last 6 months.I resigned at the conclusion of this, and while I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve given Skyscanner my best, I can definitely say I don‚Äôt see how it was going to get any better.Is there a plan? Yup.I have a rough framework for the 12 months, split into 2 parts:Part 1: Focusing on myselfPart 2: Exploring problem spacesEvery month will have a particular theme, resolutions to keep and a project.For example, Month Numero Uno looks like this:Theme: FocusResolutions: Say no to distractions, Do one thing at a time, Use a timer(90 mins to write this post!)Project: Post 3x a weekIn part 1 ‚ÄòFocusing on Myself‚Äô:Some themes I want to work on are:Reconnecting with my bodyBuilding my understanding of nutritionBeing a child againWidening my communityAs for part 2, ‚ÄòExploring Problem Spaces‚Äô:There are 3 in particular that resonate on a deeply personal level:People‚Äôs relationship with foodAging with dignityMental healthSo that might mean seeking out people making an impact in these spaces, getting involved somehow and attending conferences.I have a plan, but I‚Äôm not going to pretend I have my shit together.I‚Äôm terrified that I‚Äôll waste this time.I‚Äôm terrified that I‚Äôll still feel the same way in a year.I‚Äôm terrified of not going with the flow enough.I‚Äôm terrified of The Plan becoming a source of anxiety in itself, instead of being a way to manage the anxiety.But hey, one of my resolutions to not let my fear of failure limit me is to ‚Äúmake failure fun‚Äù:Note the big smile despite face planting in the snow!That said, I‚Äôm also excited.I‚Äôll be heading to Japan this week, have plans to spend a month in Bali taking up cooking classes and to move to Europe later this year.Along the way, I‚Äôve committed to documenting things in writing, photos and haikus, so stay tuned. üôÇIf you‚Äôre on mobile, you can sign up for this blog‚Äôs newsletter at the bottom (after the instagram widget!)If on desktop, on the right sidebar!I end this post with a song that came on during my morning jog, which starts with ‚ÄúQuit my job at the store‚Äù.

GOOD LUCK!Reply	soniamao says:	March 6, 2020 at 5:54 am	Thank you! I‚Äôll add that to my reading list! üôÇReply	Princess Chip says:	February 25, 2020 at 12:09 am	Oh! I just did exactly the same! In fact Saturday was my last day at work. of course i did it for different reasons and we pronanly have different plan‚Ä¶ but i am glad to feel less alone doing this. good luck with your sabbatical xxReply	soniamao says:	March 6, 2020 at 5:54 am	Thank you so much! And congratulations!! Likewise to you, all the best xxReply	D says:	June 9, 2020 at 6:56 pm	I guess i can relate to wanting to just leave your job and go on a sabbatical. For my case it would be i‚Äôve been in the same company for 4 years and i just don‚Äôt like my job and don‚Äôt feel appreciated. Was ready to resign and take it easy for a bit to look for another job and maybe discover something that i really want to do but COVID happened so‚Ä¶.Anyway right now am just a wage slave staying on just to get a monthly salary, definitely won‚Äôt be good for me in the long run and the CB/Phase 1 isn‚Äôt helping mental health wise. Hopefully fingers crossed the economy gets going soon and i won‚Äôt have to feel guilty about leaving and facing the what seems like gargantuan task of looking for a new job in the bleak economy.Reply	soniamao says:	June 10, 2020 at 7:23 am	Hi D,Thanks for your comment. I appreciate you shared something personal with me here.Yes, COVID has thrown quite a massive curve ball‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry to hear things aren‚Äôt going well for you right now. It can‚Äôt be easy staying stuck in a job you don‚Äôt like when you‚Äôve already made up your mind that you want to leave ‚Äî also a difficult and brave decision to make!On the mental health front, please do take care of yourself.If you don‚Äôt already use the app Calm, I have a 30-day pass that I‚Äôd like to share with you. (no affiliation at all, I just personally find it very helpful)Here it is: https://www.calm.com/gp/tysndyI particularly liked the ‚ÄòHow to Meditate‚Äô series and the ‚ÄòCreative Living Beyond Fear‚Äô + ‚ÄòPeak Performance‚Äô MasterclassesWishing you all the best, and please feel free to reach out anytime.Reply	{\"email\":\"Email address invalid\",\"url\":\"Website address invalid\",\"required\":\"Required field missing\"}Never miss a good story!
