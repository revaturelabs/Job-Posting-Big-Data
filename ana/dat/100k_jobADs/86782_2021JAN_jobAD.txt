(Credit: Jen Cantwell Weiss via Storyful)LOS ANGELES - A Utah woman used the power of social media to raise money to help an older veteran pay for repairs to his home after she saw him struggling to deliver groceries to her home.Jen Cantell Weiss shared footage on Nov. 15 showing the man, who worked as a delivery driver, struggling to walk up the steps of her home in Ogden as he dropped off her groceries.“I had an order delivered this AM and the gentleman doing the delivery really struggled getting up my stairs with the pack of soda. I didn't watch this video til after he was already gone, or else I would have gone out to help him,” Weiss wrote on Facebook. “Seeing this video makes me feel so bad.”A relative of the man saw the footage Weiss posted and put her in touch with him.RELATED: Woman invites those ‘feeling lonely’ to virtual Thanksgiving dinner by drawing them at her table\"I was concerned for him and wanted to learn more about his situation and what I could do to help him so he wouldn't need to do deliveries anymore, especially during the winter months,\" Weiss told FOX TV Stations.AdvertisementWeiss discovered that the man, named Larry, is a veteran who suffered a stroke earlier in 2020 and had to relearn how to walk.Weiss shared his story on Facebook, saying he took the delivery job to pay for repairs to his roof, and appealed for people to help him with the costs.“He was so careful and particular with how he placed things and arranged them on my porch. This was clearly a man who takes great pride in his work, even if it is just delivering someone's groceries. He obviously has a great work ethic even with his health struggles and that really made me want to help him however I could,” Weiss shared.Weiss posted Larry’s Venmo information and the donations started to pour in, she said. Weiss said Larry was overwhelmed with gratitude.RELATED: Kind-hearted 5th-grader doles out snacks, positive messages to 100,000 for Thanksgiving\"He was completely speechless and really surprised that so many kind people wanted to help him,\" Weiss shared. \"He was just so blown away by everyone's generosity.\"“I have been in touch with him and he is overwhelmed with gratitude,” she wrote on Facebook. “He did NOT ask for any help, but I love that people are touched by his story and want to help lighten his load a bit. Thank you so much everyone!”Larry told local media that the donations covered his roof repairs and he no longer had to do deliveries.Weiss shared an update on Facebook, saying Larry and his wife “requested that rather than continuing to donate to him, you donate to Toys for Tots or your local food bank. He says he has received more than enough and feels there are so many others out there who need the help more than he does.”“Everything we do has the potential to help someone and change someone's day, week, or life... you just never know how big of an impact you could have on someone,” Weiss said.Storyful contributed to this story.Latest NewsView MoreCOVID-19 symptoms remained for at least 6 months for some Wuhan patients, study findsWashington state considers open carry ban at demonstrations‘Wartime effort’: Biden boosting vaccine supply to states, buying 200 million more dosesPennsylvania woman accused of Pelosi laptop theft during Capitol riot banned from InternetFederal judge bars Biden from enforcing 100-day deportation banTrendingPhoenix couple finds two-way mirror in their home in viral TikTokRenton non-profit provided free groceries to those in need every week since the pandemic beganUW lab calls for ‘extra vigilance’ after discovering COVID-19 variant that could ‘take over’Tacoma leaders search for answers after street racing leads to police incidentPierce County deputies shoot, kill man who was armed with knife during domestic disputeNewsQ13 News AppElectionLocalNationalWorldConsumerHealthHealthy LivingEntertainmentCoronavirus in WashingtonCOVID-19 in WashingtonLIVE MAP: COVID-19 Cases in Washington, Around the WorldLatest from Around the WorldCOVID-19 and the EconomyMore Coronavirus NewsWeatherQ13 Weather AppWeather AlertsTrafficClosures & DelaysWeather PhotosPick My PetGardening with TimAir Quality MapSportsSeahawksMarinersSoundersStormKrakenReignHuskiesCougarsCommentaryWashington's Most WantedUS Marshals Most WantedWhere To WatchAbout WMWDavid RoseMissing and Exploited ChildrenCan You ID Me?The Divide with Brandi KruseCommentaryWatch Full EpisodesBrandi KruseBridging The DivideThis MorningWatch LiveQ13 Morning TeamFriday Night LightsHealthy LivingMom to MomYour Education DestinationBlue Friday PhotosGardening with TimDriver on the StreetAll LocalClosures & DelaysElectionWashington Election ResultsElectoral College Map2020 ElectionGet Election AlertsVoter GuidePolitical NewsMoneyPersonal FinanceConsumerBusinessEconomySavingsCOVID-19 and the EconomyJust A Bit OutsideWatch Full EpisodesMichelle LudtkaAaron LevineMore Sports NewsGet Sports Alerts from Q13About UsDownload our appsQ13 PersonalitiesFOX ShowsTV ScheduleLinks You Saw on TVJobs at Q13Request a SpeakerAdvertise With UsCaptioning InfoFCC Public FileFCC ApplicationsContestsfacebooktwitterinstagramemailUpdated Privacy PolicyTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell my Personal InformationFCC Public FileEEO Public FileAbout UsJobs At Q13 FOXContact UsThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2021 FOX Television Stations"
