The company will be providing its specialist drainage and environmental services to an award-winning UK construction and fit-out contractor for its London based construction projects.Speaking about the company’s rapid growth, Co-Owner Antoin Smyth said: “Hiring six additional staff increased our capacity to take on more work. We have been able to invest more time and energy into building relationships and following up leads among water and utilities companies in Great Britain. Without this additional workforce we would not have been able to secure this new business.”The company’s success follows trade support from Invest NI which included meetings with potential buyers in GB.“Working in partnership with Invest NI enabled us to explore opportunities in London and make valuable contacts which helped us win this new business,” adds Antoin. “The advice and guidance we are receiving, as well as financial support, is hugely important, helping us build our profile and maximise the opportunities identified in our target market.”Blockbusters Environmental Services specialises in drainage maintenance, civil works, oil contamination and no-dig pipe rehabilitation technology. It provides a range of services to both private and commercial customers including CCTV drain surveys, septic tank and sewer cleaning, drain unblocking & repairs, and grease trap cleaning.Mark Bleakney, Invest NI’s Southern Regional Manager, added: “It has been a good year for Blockbusters Environmental Services and I’m delighted that the firm’s business development strategy is delivering results. Our support has helped the company create employment opportunities in Newry, Mourne & Down and pursue valuable sales opportunities outside of Northern Ireland. It’s a great example of how a company can use a range of our support to grow. The company is well positioned to build on this success and grow its customer base in Great Britain.”Invest NI has offered Blockbusters Environmental Services over £30,000 in the last three years towards job creation and market development activities.
