Sessions focus on things like making professional small talk or running a meeting (trainers are provided with specifics on how to teach each topic, and are also trained themselves for two days before starting the job).

I was actually answering the FB queston “How are you doing today?” I thought I would test something of mine and see what happened. Regardless of the outcome I was still blogging. Much to my surprise people were telling me how good it was and commented that I should write for someone. I wanted you to know how I wrote and with nothing to show you, well, I should have left it alone but I would welcome any comments from someone such as yourself. Any hints would be a great help. In my blogs my sentences will be shorter as most people skim first to catch a glimpse of seeing something that they want to read.
