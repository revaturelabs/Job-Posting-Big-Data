There has not been any single survey ever done on this to provide an idea to people associated with this industry. Based on my experience and preliminary web study, I have attempted to provide unverified data. While the accuracy of the data is questionable but they represent some facts that might help us take a sensible decision with respect to SEO/SEM jobs in India.Fig (1.0)The above graph represents the average salary of SEO/SEM professionals. The average salary of SEO ranges from 2.5 to 9.5 Lakh depending on the years of experience. I have also observed that the job opportunity for these professionals abounds especially for 0-2 years and 3-4 years of experience. After 5-7 years experience, the job opportunity for SEO/SEM professioanls falls by 30% while the job opportunity for 8-10 years of SEO/SEM experienced professionals falls by 50%. See graph below.Fig (1.1)The graph shows a jump of 20% job opportunity for SEO/SEM professional with 3-4 years of experience is greater than 0-2 years of experienced professionals. After this, a rapid fall in job opportunities for people with higher experience in this field. The % gap will be higher that shows lower job opportunities for people with 8 years + experience.Compared to CTC, the % job opportunity for experienced professionals falls greater than the % increment in CTC. Given the fact that % CTC increase is lesser than % of increase in experience, it would be interesting to know which cities in India pay you off more to relocate for SEO/SEM jobs.Table 1.0Based on my preliminary study, I have observed that Mumbai tops the job opportunity for SEO/SEM professionals followed by Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Ahmadabad, Hyderabad and many others. Delhi & NCR, as shown in lower column of this table, is due to low CTC and poor compensation being paid to these professionals compared to other cities including Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai where the job opportunities for SEO/SEM is GREAT.If you see Google Insights, you’ll find Delhi tops for SEO jobs followed by Maharashtra. To my knowledge, SEO/SEM job opportunity in Delhi is as great as Maharashtra but the ‘search for SEO jobs’ in Delhi & NCR is higher than Mumbai. See the search trends in Google Insights.Where to Relocate?The following graph can help you take decision for taking up job offers in India cities.Assumptions –· You must think that you should get decent CTC, at least average as per standard· You must be ready to relocate· You must see cost of livingSee the graphFig (1.0)This graph represents the above table. Bhubaneswar is at the bottom next to Kolkata both in terms of CTC and job opportunities. As you move from Mumbai down to other cities, the job opportunities as well as salary for SEO/SEM professionals become lesser. Delhi is a just an exception because the city has plenty of job opportunities but CTC being paid to these professionals is low just above Kolkata and Bhubaneswar.The graph also helps an SEO/SEM professional relocate a city for a job. For example, if a job offer is made for Mumbai and for Hyderabad, you’ll definitely opt for Mumbai as far as CTC and job opportunities are concerned. If you look other factors beyond these two and opt for Hyderabad, you’ll have to settle with lower CTC and lesser number of job opportunities. In that case, the decision is purely yours.But after 8 years in SEO/SEM industry, things become very tough to live in Hyderabad or Kolkata or any other lower zones unless you further jump to another company as a project manager.I welcome your feedback on my observations!Written by Munaz AnjumShare:FacebookTwitterGoogle+StumbleUponDiggDeliciousLinkedInRedditTechnoratiNewer Post Older Post22 Comments :Karush May 25, 2013 at 5:03 PMVery detailed and helpful.
