Assess what you can hand off.If you have a team who you trust to take on more responsibility (and you should), see what job duties you can pass to them. Handing off your responsibilities can free you up for the new opportunities. Your success will be governed by the strength of your team.2. Remember your boundaries still exist.You should never allow a new role or responsibility to take away from your previous commitments, unless you can hand off tasks as previously mentioned. To help draw boundaries, block your time for specific activities whether it s family time or work-related activities. This way you are less likely to blur the lines.3. Focus on clarityThe first 90 days of trying something new can look murky. You are in the process of figuring it all out and don t always have the big picture. As you walk through this phase, stay focused on clarity. Ask yourself and the team these questions: What does success look like in the short term? What does it look like in the long term? What is my/our unique contribution? You and your team will go further if everyone knows what success looks like and how they play into accomplishing those goals.Thank you for listening to the Executive Minds Podcast!
