The heroic performance of Harmanpreet Kaur has given Indian Women Cricket a unique Identity and deserving admiration. The sparkling performance in ICC Women World Cup, 2017 of our brave girl has won billions or heart. But her life was not shinier like this before.Harmanpreet Kaur has faced many challenges and fight back to it without bending her knees and emerged as one of a brilliant player of Women Cricket Team.Journey from Moga to Indian Women Cricket TeamWomen Cricketer Harmanpreet Kaur’s spectacular 171 not out performance against Australia in the Semifinals of ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup was a treat for the whole nation. A 28-year-old Harman hails from Moga in Punjab who is receiving lots of rewards and awards for her brilliant performance and many are on their way.On Saturday, The Indian Cricket Board (BCCI) has announced a cash award of Rs. 50 Lakh for each player of Indian Women Team. Well, Harman’s journey till here was not that much easy.Harman is from typical lower-middle class family and she always wanted to become a cricketer. Her parents did all they can do, put all their resources and managed to fulfill their daughter’s dream. Still, it felt short.Rejection by Punjab Government:In the year 2010-2011, Harman was struggling for the job; she applied for a job in the Punjab Police and got disrespected by the Punjab Government. Though, she was a national player at that time since last two years.What an innings by @ImHarmanpreet and a brilliant effort by the bowlers also so far.. #INDvAUS @BCCIWomen #ICCWomensWorldCup2017— Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) July 20, 2017“Even after playing for India at a very young age, and having done well, Harmanpreet Kaur was struggling for a job. We requested Punjab Police to employ her, we even met former Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal a few times, but all we got in return was ‘You are a female cricketer. There is no scope for any employment with Punjab Police’. She went through all this.” Harman’s coach Yadwinder Singh Sodhi said.“That time a senior official in Punjab Police had told us that ‘she isn’t a Harbhajan Singh that we will give her a DSP post’. She wasn’t even granted the post of an inspector. We even met the chief minister, but to no avail,” said her coach Yadwinder Sodhi. “Not a single political party or their representative has ever visited our home since 2009 when Harmanpreet began to win laurels for the country. The least the last Akali Dal government or Congress government could have done is gave Harmanpreet a job,” Harmanpreet’s father Harmandar Singh said.Incredible batting by @ImHarmanpreet! Come on India- Let's go out and win the second half of the game as well. #AUSvIND #WWC17 #WomenInBlue— Sachin Tendulkar (@sachin_rt) July 20, 2017Later she got a job with Indian railways based on Sachin Tendulkar’s recommendation when Diana Eduljee, one of a member of Supreme Court appointed ‘Committee of Administrators’ (CoA) advocated Harmanpreet’s cause to Tendulkar.In May, Harmanpreet’s name was recommended by the BCCI for the Arjuna Award along with Cheteshwar Pujara.Father’s Pride:“We had opposition from the society and a few relatives who could not relate to the idea of a girl playing cricket. But we pushed Harman with a progressive mind. After the BCCI took over women’s cricket, things started looking up. She was passionate about the sport and went on to shine for India on debut. My chest swells with pride,” Harmanpreet’s father Harmander told Hindustan Times.This sportingly talented 28-year-old girl Harmanpreet Kaur who is an inspiration for our nation and we salute to passionate and brave Harmanpreet.
