This in turn leaves you with the dilemma of not only not getting the best person for your role but having to choose somebody “as the best of a potentially unsuitable bunch” to fill the role and hit your management targets.This current recruitment dilemma doesn't stop at the advertising stage either as many interviewees have left the building swearing that they would never work in that place if it was the last place on earth. The fault can lie with many departments in an organisation for the adverts they place, easily fixed by taking tips of other such adverts for which the application are flooding in, and also the team members who do the interviewing so not giving a positive impression of company culture. An interview shouldn’t be just about the new candidate, if a manager doesn’t sell the role and the company you may find the best possible candidate could slip through your fingers.This is a complete role reversal to how the majority of people think, it is assumed that it should be the interviewee worrying that they aren't giving the right impression, not being put off the role they were so excited about. Not everyone makes a good interviewer. There is an art to conducting an interview, a professionalism that screams “we are the best company to work for, you really want this job!”. We have done a bit of research internally and come up with a couple of tips to really sell that job role and get the right person for the job at the first time of asking.TrainingThe best manager in the world can be the worst interviewer. Being good at their job doesn't automatically make them great at hiring and many managers suffer stage fright when they enter an interview room. You should ensure that your hiring managers are equipped with solid training in both interview techniques and all the legalities as in what you are allowed to ask a candidate. Have a few role playing sessions and see if they come across and confident and dynamic or lacklustre and unenthusiastic. If they don't enjoy interviewing it may well be in the best interests of your company to have somebody else do the job.MarketingYour interviewing manager needs to also be a marketer to both put the candidate at ease and make this job sound like the best one ever. They must also sound natural and not as if they are rolling out a well-rehearsed speech for every candidate. Make sure they know the key points of every role, what the company can do for the candidate, what possible training and/or promotion is on offer. In other words, your manager needs to be as enthusiastic as the candidate while describing the bigger picture to them.Experience and Professionalism Reign SupremeWe all expect the candidate to be bang on time but it’s surprising how many managers don't practice what they preach. Turning up late smacks of unprofessionalism and will not have the candidate viewing you favourably. You must also drill into them that experience is every bit as important, and in many cases more so, than those fancy certificates and qualifications. They have to have the best interests of the company at heart, not be guided by their own opinions. Once you have got this message across to them they will go one of either two ways; become an excellent interviewer or be more than happy to let somebody else take the reins.Back to listShare StoryConnect With UsPrivacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsGet Excited, Call usBirmingham: 0121 312 1101Manchester: 0161 883 1825Leeds: 0113 880 0631London: 020 3637 9078Send a MessageCopyright © Applause IT, Somerset House, 37 Temple Street, Birmingham, B2 5DP | Company #4008943Made with by HeadRedSend us your job briefContact Name *Company Name *Email Address *Phone Number *LocationWhat role are you hiring for? *Would you like to attach a file?Choose filePlease leave this field empty.Awesome!You're taking your first step!We just need a couple of your details to get you started.Contact Name *Your Postcode *Sector of interest * DevelopmentDesignIT SupportTesting & Quality AssuranceInfrastructure & DevOpsMarketing & IT salesYour Email *Upload my CV *Please leave this field empty."
