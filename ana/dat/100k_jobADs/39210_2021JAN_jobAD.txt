A hybrid system that intelligently combines the renewable energy sources of the sun and wind provides the energy to supply the station, making electricity and heating available to the researchers on-site. The system is now to be expanded and optimized for future operations. The first step in this endeavor was to install a Data Manager M.by Floriane Willems, 11.

A sustainable concept and logistic expertise was required to create a suitable energy supply.by Anke Baars, 9. Apr. 2019 , 0 CommentsSolutionsDetailed Analysis of Commercial Battery Storage Systems with Analysis ProBatteries are taking on an increasingly important role in decentralized energy systems and constitute the heart of off-grid systems. They can also be increasingly found in on-grid systems, where they can cut energy purchase costs by means of increased self-consumption or peak load shaving. Battery monitoring plays a key role here. After all, PV system operators want to know whether their systems are actually working as intended, because downtime costs money and causes hassle. That is why SMA is offering a comprehensive upgrade for battery analysis via ennexOS.by Johannes Kehl (guest post), 5.

In this Central American country, no specifications have been defined for the grid feed-in of self-generated electricity. Grid operators fear that the electricity grids could collapse under the strain. For ECAMI S.A., a company that plans and builds renewable energy systems, SMA Data Manager M powered by ennexOS was just what it needed.by Dagmar Buth-Parvaresh, 19.

Feb. 2019 , 0 CommentsSolutionsennexOS: How Does SMA’s Energy Management Platform Work?More and more companies and private households are discovering energy management to reduce their energy costs, to become more independent from electric utility companies and to secure a sustainable energy supply at the same time. For effective energy management, all energy sectors must be linked and their control optimized. Another important factor is the direct integration into the electricity market. To easily implement this, SMA has developed ennexOS. What is the IoT platform for energy management able to do and how does it work?by Susanne Henkel, 31. Oct. 2018 , 24 CommentsSolutionsReducing Costs and Protecting the Environment: How Does Energy Management Work?Energy costs are a serious issue for companies because prices for electricity, oil and gas are continuing to rise. It is therefore becoming increasingly important to use energy efficiently for lighting, machinery, equipment, heating, cooling and air conditioning. This not only saves money but also is good for the environment and the company’s image. The best way to achieve the highest possible energy efficiency within the company is focused energy management.by Susanne Henkel, 24.
