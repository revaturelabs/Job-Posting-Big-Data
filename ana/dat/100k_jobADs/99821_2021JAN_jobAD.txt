Congratulations!Now, the next step is to fit in and make a good impression on your colleagues and new boss.Well, there are a few things you should and shouldn’t do to be a part of the team and start a new chapter in your career.In this blog, we are going to focus on the things you should never do when you start a new job.Do not be lateIf there’s one thing which has been taught to us during all those years we went to school, it is punctuality. Show up a few minutes early on your first day, even your first week at the new job. You don’t want to be the “new guy who is always late” during the first few weeks of your new job. It makes a negative impression. So, plan your first day at your new job ahead of time. Calculate the time it will take for you to get ready, prepare and have food, and the fastest and best route to avoid traffic. Factor all these in and set your alarm accordingly.Do not dress improperlyDuring your interview process, it is important that you ask the office’s dress code. You do not want to be overdressed or underdressed. Pick an outfit that will be acceptable as a proper work clothes at your new workplace. You could never go wrong with semi-formals. Pick out what you are planning to wear the night before your first day at work. Ensure that they are neatly pressed.Do not miss orientationMany companies organise workplace orientation or training for their new employees. Do not miss these orientation sessions. You may think you already know everything about the process but not all companies function the same way. Participating in the orientation helps you to understand the work culture and rules to be followed at your new workplace, thus helping you in getting used to the new surroundings. Plus, if you miss the orientation, you will miss out on many things that you should’ve learned. Don’t expect to be spoon-fed on your first day. In the professional world, you should be able to do your own tasks.Do not take personal calls too oftenEmployers pay their employees to work for a certain period of time everyday. Now imagine if you spend most of that time on the phone. No one wants to see that. You are there to work. So, unless it is absolutely necessary, avoid making too many personal calls. Use your lunch break to use your phone.Do not try to change anythingYes, you may have good ideas about how certain organization policy or strategy can be changed. However, in your first few weeks, avoid mentioning yours. You want to come off as a team player who respects his/her colleagues’ seniority and experiences. So, be a team player and learn the ins and outs of the current strategies in place. Over time, you will gain their trust and when you present your ideas, they will definitely listen to yours.Do not be hesitant to ask for helpAsking for help is not a sign of weakness. In fact, even Albert Einstein, one of the smartest men on the planet, asked questions. You will have a lot of questions on your first day. It is perfectly fine to ask for help from your supervisor or your colleagues. However, do not ask your colleagues to do the work for you. You do not want to come off as someone who is incapable of doing his/her own work.Do not be dishonestOn your first few days, while you are shown how things are done, you will be asked if you understood or if you have any questions. It is more than fine to let them know that you don’t (if you don’t), rather than being dishonest and butchering the work given to you. Just tell them that you do not know and that you’ll look into it and get back to them. Dishonesty will only ruin your chance of doing a good job.The above mentioned tips should definitely help you to rock your first few days at your new workplace and blend in with your colleagues easily.We will leave you here with our best wishes.Good luck!Please follow and like us:Post Views: 174career advicenew job tipsprofessional etiquette in the workplacetips for starting new jobworkplace etiquettePost navigation← Career Advice: Find the right career path for yourselfHow to protect yourself from a layoff →Search for:SearchRecent PostsWhat is Python Language ?
