To apply for the Delaware corporate income tax and gross receipts tax reduction, Form 402AP 9901, Application for New Business Facility Tax Credits, must be completed and returned to the Division of Revenue. The Division of Revenue will notify the applicant in writing if the application is approved or disapproved. Approval by the Division of Revenue must be granted before the corporation can claim these tax credits. A separate Form 402AP 9901 must be completed for each new or expanded facility.Corporation and Personal Income Tax CreditsEligible businesses receive credits of $500 for each qualified employee and $500 for each $100,000 invested. These credits may be taken during the tax year in which the qualified facility is placed in service and for any of the nine following years. The aggregate amount of credits claimed in any given year may not exceed fifty percent of the firm’s tax liability. Credits may be carried forward. Form 1100CR 9901, Worksheet for Credit for Approved New Business Facilities, must be completed and attached to the Delaware Corporate Income Tax return. Businesses that are not subject to the corporation income tax (e.g., pass through entities such as S-Corporations) are entitled to use the credits against the personal income tax. Form 700, Business Tax Credits, must be completed and attached to the Delaware Resident Personal Income Tax return of shareholders/partners/sole proprietors.[1] Larger credits are available for businesses which, in addition to meeting the Blue Collar Job Act’s employment and investment requirements, engage in other desirable behaviors.Amount of Credits for Property Placed in Service After 12/31/96Tax Credit Description Amt.

The amount of the alternative investment credit is equal to 75% of the corresponding “regular” Blue Collar Jobs tax credit. (E.g., if it had qualified for an investment that would have earned a $500 regular BCJ credit, the alternative investment credit would be $300 [$500 x 0.75]).Alternative Investment and Employment Requirements Required for Telecommunications Services [6] and Banking [7]Instead of five employees and $40,000 of investment per employee, telecommunication service businesses are required to hire at least 50 qualified employees and make a minimum investment of $15,000 per qualified employee. Like other firms under the BCJ, telecommunication service businesses meeting these criteria are entitled to a $500 tax credit for each qualified employee hired and a $500 credit for each $100,000 in qualified investment made.Tax credits earned by banks are used to reduce their liability under the bank franchise tax. Like telecommunication services, banks must also increase employment by a minimum of 50 employees and make a minimum investment of $15,000 per qualified employee. Unlike telecommunications services, however, there is no tax credit for each $100,000 of investment. Furthermore, only full-time employees receiving health insurance benefits are counted when calculating the $500 credit (per qualified employee).Business and Occupational Gross Receipts Tax ReductionsBusinesses meeting the regular Blue Collar Jobs employment and investment qualifications are entitled to a reduction in their gross receipts tax liability attributable to the operation of a qualified (new or expanded) facility. Tax liabilities resulting out of gross receipts derived from manufacturing, wholesaling, occupational [8] and general services, food processing, commercial feed sales, or the retail element of aviation services may be reduced according to the following schedules. [9] In order to take the gross receipts reduction, Form 402LTR 9901, Computation Schedule for Claiming License Tax Reduction for Approved New Business Facility Gross Receipts, must be completed and attached to the gross receipts tax return coupon.For Firms Not Operating in a Targeted AreaMonths Elapsed Since the Qualified Facility was Placed in Service Percent Reduction in Gross Receipts Tax1 through 12 90%13 through 24 80%25 through 36 70%37 through 48 60%49 through 60 50%61 through 72 40%73 through 84 30%85 through 96 20%97 through 108 10%109 through 120 5%Over 120 0%For Firms Operating in a Targeted AreaMonths Elapsed Since the Qualified Facility was Placed in Service Percent Reduction in Gross Receipts Tax1 through 60 100%61 through 72 90%73 through 84 80%85 through 96 70%97 through 108 60%109 through 120 50%121 through 132 40%133 through 144 30%169 through 180 5%Over 180 0%As is the case with the corporate and personal income tax credits, businesses qualifying under the alternative investment standard (no employee option) are entitled to a gross receipts tax reduction equal to 75% of the amounts listed above.
