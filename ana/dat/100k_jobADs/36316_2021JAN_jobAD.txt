The network is supported by 5 more partners, including 2 companies. The mission of the HORATES network is to use the large expertise on all aspects of hybrid and organic thermoelectrics that is available in the EU for (a) the strategic training of excellent young researchers in an emerging, interdisciplinary field and (b) the rational development of prototype energy harvesters, inspired by actual market demand.This will happen by giving 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) exposure to a wide spectrum of expertise. In HORATES, we fuse the synthetic organic expertise with the expertise in processing and characterization to provide stable, high-performance materials and recipes for upscaling and device fabrication. Constant interaction at all stages with theory and multiscale modelling will guide the process. Crucial for the success of the Programme is a multidisciplinary and inter-sectorial network, which will allow the ESR to genuinely discover and/or feed her/his attitude while having an impact on a relevant scientific and technological field. HORATES also has the mission of disseminating its scientific and technological achievements to a broad audience (scientific community, stakeholders, general public etc.).The HORATES network is composed by: Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg (DE), Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IT), Chalmers Tekniska Högskola AB (SE), Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior de Investigationes Cientificas (ES), Linköpings Universitet (SE), Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (NL), Technische Universität Chemnitz (DE), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (FR), University of Strasbourg (FR), Eurecat Centre Tecnològic (ES), Innovation Lab (DE) and Hot Disk AB (SE).During the programme, exchange between private sector and academia is promoted by at least one secondment per ESR with the industrial partners and beneficiaries.We are looking for 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) to be appointed at the host organisations within HORATES.The University of Groningen offers 1 Fellowship on “Electrical characterization and modelling of organic thermoelectric materials and devices”.The ESR will be primarily operating at the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials, in the Photophysics and Optoelectronics group under the supervision of Prof. Jan Anton Koster. The ESR will work on the electrical characterization and numerical simulation of organic thermoelectric materials and devices. The modelling involves a multiphysics approach to optimize the design of thermoelectric generators based on organic semiconductors. The experimental part involves measuring the thermoelectric properties (electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient) and density-of-states of materials supplied by our collaborators.Project title: Electrical characterization and modelling of organic thermoelectric materials and devicesWaste heat is a ubiquitous source of low-quality energy that is yet to be harvested and transformed into high-quality energy in the form of electricity. Low-cost and highly scalable thermoelectric generators (TEGs) based on organic materials and hybrid composites have the huge potential to achieve this. Triggered by actual market demand for printable TEGs, we seek a PhD student in the emerging interdisciplinary field of organic thermoelectrics.Organic thermoelectric materials have recently attracted considerable attention. They are flexible, low-cost, abundant, and can be processed via low-cost techniques. Hybrid organic/inorganic thermoelectrics can combine the high Seebeck coefficient of the inorganic compound with the low thermal conductivity of organic materials. However, in order to obtain competitive ZT-values, more research is needed.We are looking for a PhD candidate to work on the electrical characterization and numerical simulation of organic thermoelectric materials and devices. This position is part of a large European project and the successful candidate is expected to communicate and collaborate effectively with other researchers with a wide range in backgrounds. Within this disciplinary project, a number of secondments are planned to further train the PhD student in specific skills. We are looking for someone with a physics background who can do experiments but is also willing and able to do some numerical modelling.The modelling involves a multiphysics approach to optimize the design of thermoelectric generators based on organic semiconductors. The experimental part involves measuring the thermoelectric properties (electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient) and density-of-states of materials supplied by our collaborators.Start date: between 1st of March and 1st of September 2021Qualificationsuniversity degree in Physics, Chemistry or Material Science or related Engineering disciplinesthe applicant cannot hold a PhD degree obtained before the enrolling in the HORATES programmefluency in spoken and written English.You are expected to:hold a (research) master degree (or will graduate before appointment date) in physics or a similar, related fieldideally have experience in the field organic semiconductorsbe a team player, willing to work with a diverse group of researchers and technicians, and can also work independentlyhave strong communication skills and are motivated to disseminate results to both scientific peers and a broad audiencebe proficient in the English language (oral and written) e.g. with a minimum IELTS score of 7.0 overall and 6.5 on partsbe strongly motivated to obtain a PhD degree.Technical skills: An MSc degree in physics, material science or engineering (or equivalent) is essential. A background in thermoelectrics and/or demonstrable affinity with computer simulations would be an advantage.OrganisationMSCA ITN Horates Grant Agreement n. 955837The University of Groningen is a research university with a global outlook, deeply rooted in Groningen, City of Talent.
