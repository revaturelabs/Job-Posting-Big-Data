Is the State mandating residents to conserve more water?The State prohibits practices that waste water, but has eased the limit of required water conservation. While California is still recovering from a five year historic drought, the Governor’s latest drought-related action establishes permanent water conservation measures. Improved supply conditions in northern California and conservation achievements statewide have allowed water agencies, including Anaheim to slightly increase water use. However, we are still asking the community to continue to be proactive in using water wisely.2. What are the proposed mandatory water use restrictions?The State has proposed the following water uses be permanently restricted:Hosing off sidewalks, driveways and other hardscapes;Washing automobiles with hoses not equipped with a shut-off nozzle;Using non-recirculated water in a fountain or other decorative water feature;Watering lawns in a manner that causes runoff, or within 48 hours after measurable precipitation; andIrrigating ornamental turf on public street medians3. Is there a current conservation target?The City no longer has a State mandated requirement to reduce water demand. Although the City is not mandated to reduce demand, we are targeting a self‐issued conservation goal of 10%. To reach this goal, and work towards long term sustainability of our water resources, the City is targeting the elimination of outdoor water waste.4. What is the City doing about ongoing water conservation?City Council adopted Plan 1 of the Water Reduction Ordinance on July 25, 2017, to update mandatory water conservation measures. Plan I recommends voluntary water use limits and voluntary landscape irrigation limits to three days per week. In regards to the state mandated restrictions the Public Utilities Department with Code Enforcement’s assistance is able to issue fines to water wasters up to $500 per incident. The Department is also providing various rebates to help customers use water wisely.5. What is the new watering (three days per week) schedule?The watering schedule is now voluntary and is separated between odd and even numbered addresses.Odd numbered addresses can water on Mondays, Wednesdays, or Saturdays.Even numbered addresses can water on Tuesdays, Thursdays, or Sundays.Street addresses ending in ½ or any fraction will use the last whole number in the address to determine watering days.No irrigation on Fridays.Spot watering with a hose to maintain trees or plants (other than turf) is allowed.Drip irrigation is exempt.6. Why were these days chosen?The distribution of outdoor watering days will avoid concentrating irrigation use on certain days, which could otherwise impact water mains.7. How long can I water on the three days?If participating in the voluntary reduction the following recommendations apply:Irrigation duration is limited to 8 minutes per station for standard spray head sprinklers and bubblers.Irrigation duration is limited to 15 minutes per cycle and up to two (2) cycles for irrigation systems with high efficiency nozzles.Here are no time limitations for drip irrigation.8. Does the City have enough water?Currently, the answer is yes, because the City has planned for droughts by investing in local water supply projects and regional water storage programs. The City has enough water for all customers and fire protection. However, we are coming out of a five year historic drought and our groundwater resources still need more time to fully recover. Therefore, we are asking customers to use water wisely in order to protect our water supplies in case next year does not produce enough precipitation to refill our groundwater supplies.9. Will my water bill go up?The City’s water rates are based on the cost to serve its customers, which includes water supplies, operation of the system, capital investments, and any penalties assessed by the state. If water agencies like Anaheim are assessed penalties, or are subject to increases in water supply costs from its wholesale providers, those costs are ultimately paid by customers. Please be assured that Anaheim remains one of the lowest cost providers in Orange County.10. Don’t we get most of our water from underground? Are we still required to conserve?Even though Anaheim is fortunate to receive about 75% of its water from the groundwater basin, we are still subject to the regional issue of lower storage in reserves. Without enough rainfall in Southern California these reserves do not get replenished.11. I see a business or neighbor waster water all the time. What should I do, report them?We encourage neighbors to talk to each other about the water conservation in a positive manner.
