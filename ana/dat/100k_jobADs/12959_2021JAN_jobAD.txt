This position will focus on systems configured for high-performance computing.Changing the underlying technology for accelerators not only improves energy efficiency dramatically but will also call for novel system architectures, spanning from SSD and DRAM to the compute core architectures, potentially across multiple accelerator nodes.Teaming up with various experts inside imec, you will explore and benchmark design and architecture trade-offs for new technologies to enable compute-in-memory for machine learning, computational memories and building a flexible and programmable digital system around it.You will be responsible for:Building a system simulation framework that can help to explore the benefits of advanced semiconductor technology solutions in the high-performance computing (HPC) domain.Evaluate the impact of technology-driven AI/ML hardware in application domains such as HPC, AR/VR, automotive sector.Defining system architecture for distributed Machine Learning solutions.Exploring novel chip and system architectures to enable technology development, leveraging imec’s computational memoriesModeling and simulating new architectures to analyze critical trade-offs and bottlenecks. You abstract away the lower level details and capture the essential traits that will determine power and performanceSuch system level optimizations are inherently application specific. In order to achieve a large enough market volume to motivate the huge NRE costs for novel technology, the application domain where such a solution is focused on should be sufficiently broad. The framework should be able to cover multiple application domains, ranging from the typical multi-core server systems, to dedicated heterogenous systems with e.g. AI accelerators or emerging compute platforms like AR/VR headsets.What we do for youWe offer you the opportunity to join one of the world’s premier research centers in nanotechnology at its headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. With your talent, passion and expertise, you’ll become part of a team that makes the impossible possible. Together, we shape the technology that will determine the society of tomorrow.We are proud of our open, multicultural, and informal working environment with ample possibilities to take initiative and show responsibility. We commit to supporting and guiding you in this process; not only with words but also with tangible actions. Through imec.academy, 'our corporate university', we actively invest in your development to further your technical and personal growth.We are aware that your valuable contribution makes imec a top player in its field. Your energy and commitment are therefore appreciated by means of a competitive scholarship.Who you areYou have a Ph.D. degree in Electrical or Computer EngineeringYou have experience with the system architecture modeling and research.We are looking for your knowledge in advanced CMOS and memory technologiesWe value your experience with industry-standard EDA tools like Cadence/Synopsys, specifically system modeling tools and languages: SystemC, Platform Architect or similar.We are looking for a good team player and your ability to work independentlyYou have excellent English communication skills and enjoy working in a multicultural environmentThis postdoctoral position is funded by imec through KU Leuven. Because of the specific financing statute which targets international mobility for postdocs, only candidates who did not stay or work/study in Belgium for more than 24 months in the past 3 years can be considered for the position (short stays such as holiday, participation in conferences, etc. are not taken into account).ApplyShare this article ontwitterFollow imec on:twitterExpertiseDive into our expertise.Artificial intelligenceLife sciencesConnected health solutionsDiscover more...What we offerOur R&D solutions and innovation servicesResearchDevelopmentSolutionsVenturingJobsDiscover our careers.Job opportunitiesAcademic ExcellenceMore imecAbout imecConnect with usEvent calendarFuture SummitsImec the Netherlandsimec USAInfrastructureOrganizationReading roompartner site|disclaimer|privacy statement|cookie policyThis website uses cookies for analytics purposes only without any commercial intent.
