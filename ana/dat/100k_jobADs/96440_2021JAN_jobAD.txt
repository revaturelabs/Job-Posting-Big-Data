Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) plans to build a cable manufacturing facility in the park for its Optical Communications business segment, creating approximately 110 jobs over the next five years and investing $60 million in this location. Trivium Corporate Center, located between Robinwood Road and Startown Road in Hickory, is being jointly developed by the City of Hickory, Catawba County, and the EDC, as one of the four City of Hickory bond projects. Bond funds totaling $4.5 million have been allocated to Trivium Corporate Center. The Latin word trivium means “the place where three roads meet,” which reflects the location of the Corporate Center along the main connector between Interstate 40, and U.S. Highways 70 and 321. As part of the project, 26.82 acres owned by the Trivium Corporate Center Inc., a non-profit entity jointly developed and funded by Catawba County and the City of Hickory, will be transferred to Corning for its new facility. Corning plans to add manufacturing capacity to maintain its market-leading position and ensure reliable supply for its customers as it addresses growing worldwide demand for optical fiber and cable, the company has indicated. “Signing the first tenant for Trivium Corporate Center opens a new chapter for economic development in Hickory — made possible by the vision of our citizens who approved bond funds for projects to help the local economy grow and thrive,” said Warren Wood, Hickory city manager and president of the Trivium Corporate Center Board of Directors. “It’s especially fitting that the first tenant will be Corning, a keystone of our business community for almost 40 years.”READ MOREWant More Stories Like This Delivered to Your Inbox?
