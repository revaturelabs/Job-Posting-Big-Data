Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and U.S. Rep. Neal Dunn, R-Fla., have been able to get their proposal to move veterans into the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields through Congress and to President Donald Trump’s desk.At the start of last year, Rubio and Dunn unveiled the “Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act” which, they insist, “would assist veterans re-entering the workforce by directing the National Science Foundation to encourage veterans to study and pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM).” The bill would have the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) create an “interagency working group to coordinate federal programs for transitioning and training veterans for STEM careers, and to develop a strategic plan to address the barriers that veterans face when reentering the workforce.”Last month, the U.S. Senate passed Rubio’s version of the bill, which has presidential hopeful U.S Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., as the main cosponsor, without opposition. Dunn was able to get his version, which had U.S. Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., as a cosponsor, through the House this week without opposition.The bill had more than 10 other cosponsors and has the support of the the Manufacturing Institute, Samsung, TechNet, Verizon and the Consumer Technology Association.“Our service members should have every opportunity to succeed when they transition to civilian life,” Dunn said on Monday. “This important legislation ensures our government goes above and beyond to bring STEM career opportunities to our veterans. By increasing education and having veterans fill these 21st century jobs, we help keep our promise to those who serve and also maintain America’s competitive edge as a global technology leader.”“This important bipartisan bill to ensure our nation’s veterans have the skills and opportunities to succeed in STEM careers is now on its way to the president’s desk,” Rubio said. “The 21st-century workforce will be dominated by STEM roles, and our nation’s veterans are uniquely qualified to fill these jobs. I thank my colleagues in the Senate and House for getting this bipartisan bill across the finish line.”Reach Kevin Derby at kevin.derby@floridadaily.com.TAGSamy klobucharconsumer technology associationdonald trumpmarco rubiomichael waltzneal dunnostpsamsungsupporting veterans in stem careers acttechnetverizonFacebookTwitterLinkedinEmailPrevious articleRoss Spano Rounds Up More Support for Proposal Helping Human Trafficking VictimsNext articleCasey DeSantis Announces 8,000 Reading ScholarshipsKEVIN DERBYRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORElectionsMarco Rubio, Rick Scott Continue to Champion Ted Cruz’s Congressional Term Limits AmendmentFlorida PoliticsRick Scott Showcases Bills He’ll Champion on Capitol HillFlorida NewsJimmy Patronis: Move the 2021 Olympics From Tokyo to FloridaLEAVE A REPLY Cancel replyPlease enter your comment!Please enter your name hereYou have entered an incorrect email address!Please enter your email address hereCurrent ye@r *Leave this field emptyPOPULAR CATEGORIESFlorida Politics3783U.S. Politics2682Slider1425Economy1259Florida News909Elections785Business767Foreign Affairs709Public Safety610Environment603Healthcare590Florida Daily is your Florida news website.
