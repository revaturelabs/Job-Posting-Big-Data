They organise and carry out field work, including excavation and surface collections. They may clean, conserve, restore, reconstruct and display material found at sites. They may photograph or draw characteristics or artefacts at the site for later analysis. They then analyse things found at the site and document their findings. They will also often write journal articles for publication.Working conditionsAn archaeologist may work indoors analysing artefacts and conducting research. They may also undertake field work, outdoors and at various sites - conditions can be harsh and the work will typically involve getting your hands dirty.Tools and technologiesArchaeologists may use technology specially designed for cleaning artefacts. Increasingly, archaeologists are using computer- based technologies, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) devices.How do I become one?Education and trainingTo become an archaeologist, you usually need to complete a degree at university majoring in archaeology or a related area, followed by postgraduate studies in the same field.Most universities in Western Australia offer relevant courses.
