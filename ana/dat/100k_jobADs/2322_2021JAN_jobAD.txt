It also depends on the features of the server you're in right now. For instance, if the server has healers and such, you can simply use an archer and go back and forth the map (whether there's a warper or warp).Another thing, it also depends on the gameplay you prefer, and this varies from one person to another. If you depend on healer or warper/warp portals - then restocking your sp via those available nps would work. However, some people may not like map-hopping gameplay. Flee-type DPS classes (such as hunter/sniper, sin/sinx, etc.) are always good to have if you wish to stay in one single map for a long while.You said it's a lowrate Pre-Renewal. (but if you prefer a midrate, check CGRO) If i were to play in that server, I'd go for assassin or sinx, alt a soul linker for assassin spirit, use jamadhar bought from NPC, and use a sage to endow myself with fire. I'm pretty sure that's enough build to 1hit an Orc Archer. Use Teleport INSTANTLY right every skill (assuming you can 1hit the mob). That should give you a quick way to farm OAB.LoggedggwpAl De Baran AlchemistJoin Date: Feb 2014Posts: 170256 ZenyView InventorySend Money To ggwpRe: Best class to farm OAB?« Reply #4 on: Dec 19, 2017, 01:31 pm »QuoteIf i were to play in that server, I'd go for assassin or sinx, alt a soul linker for assassin spirit, use jamadhar bought from NPC, and use a sage to endow myself with fire.

Most LR dont have free healer and using 5k z official inn to farm every 8-9 mobs are stupid.LoggedParachuteMorroc TraderJoin Date: Jul 2017Posts: 2869 ZenyView InventorySend Money To ParachuteCurrent Server: CGRORe: Re: Best class to farm OAB?« Reply #5 on: Dec 19, 2017, 02:43 pm »Quote from: ggwp on Dec 19, 2017, 01:31 pmWTF , assassin link doubles SB sp cost or 68 SP each use.

If he specifically added it to the criteria, then it makes sense to take it in consideration.Second, seems like he asks here in RMS to gather insight on things he may or may not previously known. he mentioned specifically about classes, then everybody suggested a Sniper, which is a good choice, but he wanna know if there's another option. thus, the sinx suggestion.Third, Chill.
