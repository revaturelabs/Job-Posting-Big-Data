We want Cyberpunk 2077 to be our crowning achievement for this generation, and postponing launch will give us the precious months we need to make the game perfect.”Cyberpunk 2077 has been in the works since at least 2013, but CD Projekt Red has only started really showing off extended gameplay in the past year. The game is supposed to be packed with sci-fi combat mechanics, body mods, vehicles, narrative choices, and romance options, so it’s not a stretch to imagine those things taking some more time to get right.A multiplayer component for Cyberpunk 2077 was also originally supposed to launch after the game’s April debut, among other free add-ons. In an investor call after the announcement, CD Projekt Red said the multiplayer option probably won’t launch until after 2021. The studio has promised more updates about the game in general as we get closer to September.Post navigationPrevious Post Previous post:Jessica Mendoza, Mets advisor, backtracks after ripping Mike FiersNext Post Next post:Christopher Tolkien, Keeper of His Father’s Legacy, Dies at 95SaadView all posts by Saad →You might also likeTodd Gurley is suddenly available.
