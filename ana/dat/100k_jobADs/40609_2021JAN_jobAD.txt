Best known for its peri-peri sauce that can be added to their grills and pizza, it’s a hot and spicy affair everyone ought to try! Espresso also serves fine seafood, their calamari being the most popular with regular guests. The chicken prego roll is a meal option also commonly loved, with a dash of that peri-peri sauce. Feeling more for pasta? Espresso has options for you too! With outdoor and indoor seating options, Espresso is a great setting for sunny lunches or vibrant dinners.Have you been here?
