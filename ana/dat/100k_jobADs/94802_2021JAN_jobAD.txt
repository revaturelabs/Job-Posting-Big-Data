Job losses are typically seen in such areas as construction and tourism between the fall and winter months.While the state unemployment rate is seasonally adjusted, the county rates are not, and the raw unemployment rates in most Wyoming counties typically go up between September and October.The highest jobless rate in the state in October was found in Natrona County (4.8 percent) followed by Fremont County (4.7 percent) and Campbell and Fremont Counties (4.2 percent). The October 2017 jobless rates of 4.2 percent was well below the 5.0 percent recorded a year earlier. But state economist David Bullard said that news is not as positive as it appears at first glance because the overall state labor force decreased by 7,789 people (-2.6 percent) over that same time.But Bullard says the good news is that the state economy, and the critical energy sector in particular, seem to be stabilizing recently.Filed Under: energy industry, Unemployment, Wyoming EconomyCategories: ArticlesCommentsLeave A CommentBack To TopWyoming Department of Health Confirms 21 New COVID DeathsRecommended for youLatest ArticlesWyoming Department of Health Confirms 21 New COVID DeathsUW Preparing to Administer Next Round of COVID-19 VaccinesLongmire Days On for 2021, But Delayed Until SeptemberInformationEEO Public FileMarketing and Advertising SolutionsFCC ApplicationsReport an InaccuracyTermsVIP TermsFAQContest RulesPrivacy PolicyExercise My Data RightsContactLaramie Business ListingsFollow Us2021 Laramie Live, Townsquare Media, Inc.
