Yes, there certainly are people who currently hold employment in the wind-energy industry in this country, but the mere existence of jobs in no way means that these are productive, profitable jobs that contribute to private-sector economic growth. The jobs he’s referring to are, in fact, a drain on our economy: The federal government subsidizes the heck out of the wind industry, which means that all of these supposedly fabulous jobs come at the opportunity cost of all those dollars we’re pouring into the industry being spent productively elsewhere.Notice how the wind industry is so wildly desperate to keep the wind production tax credit around? That would be because they know that their businesses cannot survive without it — a.k.a., wind energy is not capable of standing up to the test of free-market competition. A.k.a., imaginary. Imaginary jobs do not spur growth, and quixotically bankrupting ourselves with public “investments” in the quest to fulfill our own green prophecies is certainly not going to help us compete in the global economic arena.Tags: Barack Obama economy green energy subsidies wind energyShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShow CommentsPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Related StoriesSunday morning talking headsJazz Shaw Jan 17, 2021 8:01 AMImpeachments, inaugurations and pandemics, oh my!California hospital offering $300 bribe for workers willing to be vaccinatedJazz Shaw Jan 16, 2021 8:31 PMPretty please?Trending on Townhall MediaThere are almost 10 billion new reasons why Gavin Newsom should be recalled as Governor of CaliforniaTwitchyA Startling Thread on the National Guard Presence in Washington, D.C., for Inauguration DayPJ Media	Gripping '09 Documentary Featuring Fauci, Redfield, & Other Now-Familiar Faces Inadvertently Sheds Some Very Interesting Light on COVID-19RedstateDemocrat House Already Planning Gun Control BillsBearingarmsRecent StoriesAnother university professor charged in China ties, grant fraudJazz Shaw Jan 16, 2021 7:01 PMThe Chinese Communist Party apparently can’t be stoppedKatie Couric: GOP lawmakers have to be ‘deprogrammed’, applauds Trump’s impeachmentKaren Townsend Jan 16, 2021 5:31 PMFawns over Joe BidenDOJ: On second thought, there’s no proof rioters were intended to ‘capture and assassinate’ anyoneJohn Sexton Jan 16, 2021 4:00 PM“officials have not found ‘direct’ evidence of a kill-capture plot”A ban on body armor?
