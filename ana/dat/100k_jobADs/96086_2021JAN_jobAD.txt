Shaw ResearchFellowship ID: 1190-PFCOMB2 [#15823]Fellowship Title: Postdoctoral Fellowships in Computational Chemistry, Biology, and Physics at D. E. Shaw ResearchFellowship Type: PostdoctoralFellowship Location: New York, New York 10036, United States [map]Application Deadline: 2021/01/13 11:59PM (posted 2020/12/13, updated 2020/03/18)Fellowship Description:*** the list date or deadline for this fellowship has passed. ***D. E. Shaw Research is seeking postdoctoral fellows to join our New York–based team. This is a unique opportunity to develop and work with transformative technology in a dynamic, interdisciplinary environment. Candidates should have expertise in computational, theoretical, or quantum chemistry, computational biophysics, structural biology, drug discovery, theoretical chemical physics, applied mathematics, or in a relevant area of computer science.Relevant areas of experience might include direct application of molecular dynamics or other computational methods to drug discovery, investigation of allosteric interactions or other functionally important conformational changes in biological molecules, structure prediction or design for proteins or RNA, study of protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions, force field improvement through detailed comparisons of simulation data with NMR measurements or other experimental data, development and implementation of new methodology, such as integrators or efficient approximations of long-range forces, methods for enhanced sampling or free-energy calculations, or tools to efficiently analyze large simulation datasets. Specific knowledge of any of these areas is less critical, however, than strong research skills, and a history of innovation and accomplishment. We are committed to fostering a stimulating, rewarding, and flexible work environment, and we offer above-market compensation.To submit an application, please use the link provided below:https://deshawresearch.avature.net/careers/Register?pipelineId=580&source=Mathjobs.orgD. E. Shaw Research is an independent research group that is pursuing an ambitious, long-term strategy aimed at fundamentally transforming the process of drug discovery. We have developed a special-purpose supercomputer, ANTON®, capable of executing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations orders of magnitude faster than was previously possible. Our current projects include investigations of proteins and other biomedically relevant macromolecules as well as the development of computational chemistry methods to enable more accurate and effective MD simulations.D. E. Shaw Research is an equal opportunity employer, dedicated to the goal of building a diverse workforce. We welcome inquiries from all exceptionally well-qualified applicants, regardless of race, color, nationality, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, caste, gender, gender identity, pregnancy, caregiver status, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital or civil partner status, disability, or status in any other category protected in this regard by law in any jurisdiction in which we operate.We are not accepting applications for this position through Mathjobs.Org right now.
