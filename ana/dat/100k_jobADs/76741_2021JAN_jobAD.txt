Kamala Harris which will be publicly released momentarily,” the email reads. “Sen. Kamala Harris will be personally traveling to Texas on Friday – October 30. 2020.”Her visit comes as polls project a tight presidential race in Texas. According to the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll, Trump leads Biden in the state by 5 percentage points. Trump won Texas by 9 points in 2016.In the lead-up to Election Day, Texas Democrats have called for both Biden and Harris to invest heavily in Texas. In an October op-ed in The Washington Post, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who endorsed Biden after dropping his own presidential bid, and Tory Gavito, the president and co-founder of the progressive donor network Way to Win, urged the Biden campaign to steer serious money to the state.“Biden, his campaign and Democrats in general need to make it clear: We are competing in Texas, and we’ll invest whatever it takes to turn out the state’s true electoral majority and flip Texas once and for all,” they wrote. “Democrats have historically failed to invest in Texas, despite the size of this prize, because they believed the door is closed to Democratic presidential candidates. But, like many things in 2020, this year is different — Biden has his foot in the door and needs to kick it open for a quick end to the election.”Biden expanded his on-the-ground presence in Texas in September, hiring 13 more staff members — after an initial hiring announcement in early August — to his team.Biden’s wife, Jill Biden, visited Texas earlier this month to mark the state’s first day of early voting. She rallied voters in El Paso, Dallas and Houston, telling them a historic opportunity was within reach.Post navigationPrevious Post Previous post:Browns vs. Bengals final score: Cleveland wins shootout on Baker Mayfield’s fifth touchdownNext Post Next post:Nicole Kidman And Hugh Grant Star In New HBO Thriller, ‘The Undoing’SaadView all posts by Saad →You might also likeIshqiya Episode 8 | 23rd March 2020 | ARY Digital DramaMarch 23, 2020Portland Trail Blazers at Utah Jazz odds, picks and best betsFebruary 8, 2020Newly reopened South Florida seen as an emerging coronavirus hot spotMay 17, 2020Amber Alert canceled; children found safeMarch 16, 2020London hospitals facing ‘tsunami’ of coronavirus casesMarch 26, 2020Barcelona down Juventus with goals from Messi, DembeleOctober 29, 2020How celebrities use mortgages to build wealth (and you can, too)November 14, 2020Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
