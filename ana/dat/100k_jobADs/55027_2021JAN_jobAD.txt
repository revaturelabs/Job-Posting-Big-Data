Do you make him quiver like a locust, while his thunderous snorting spreads terror? He paws the valley, he rejoices in his strength, and charges into battle. He laughs at fear and cannot be terrified; he does not retreat from the sword. Job 39:19-22The Maker of Heaven and earth, the seas and all that is in them, Who keeps faith forever, secures justice for the oppressed, who gives bread to the hungry. The LORD sets prisoners free; the LORD gives sight to the blind. The LORD raises up those who are bowed down; the LORD loves the righteous. Psalm 146:6-8Jesus said to (the scholar of the law), “You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and the first Commandment. Matthew 22:37-38Job 39:19-25, Psalm Ruth 1:1-22 & Matthew 22:34-40There is a beauty in majesty of a horses pure power energized to claw at the earth with such amazing speed or pull a wagon full of stones God set them as flint on a rock strong filled with no fear of oncoming devastation. This is the feeling of anyone who places God First never holding back allowed by the Will of God to share the joy of Charity (Jesus) in every act of love swallowed with continual hope for faith to be felt, fathomed and found.Daily I share the desire God places in every soul whether acknowledged or not to be free in peace even in the heat of a battle. Sing this song such as the tune I share in uttering universally the poetic sense God has given in our likes and dislikes of life knowing everything we want must be Spirit-led, God-inspired and Christ-fed surrender. We must be willing to pray in public as much as we are in private taking the hand of another old or new daily in a peace of practice, prayer and proclamation of Truth. I love praying openly with strangers turned Brothers or Sisters in Christ maybe never seeing them again but instilling in community the need of open proclamation such as I did yesterday with a stranger turned friend who gave me his hands and prayed for forgiveness. Amen.We ask in prayer. Dear LORD, we pray fear leaves our actions in Salvations need. Prayers for family. Prayers for Dr. Cruz†Peluca. LORD from Acts 42:2 I chant; “I know that You (LORD) can do all things, and that no purpose of Yours can be hindered.” In Jesus we pray.
