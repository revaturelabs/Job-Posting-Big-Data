Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected initial claims of 413,000. The four-week average of new claims, which is smoother than the weekly data, fell 12,500 to 414,000, also reaching the lowest level since July of 2008. The level of claims helps observers to analyze the health of the labor market, and economists say claims would have to remain below 400,000 before there's a substantial gain in hiring. Analysts also note that claims are difficult to seasonally adjust near the holidays. In the week ended Dec. 18, the number of people who continued to receive benefits under state unemployment programs rose 57,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.13 million. The four-week average of these continuing claims fell 37,250 to 4.12 million, the lowest level since November of 2008. Altogether, about 8.87 million people received some kind of unemployment-insurance benefit in the week ended of Dec. 11, on an unadjusted basis. That level was down about 35,000 from the prior week.AdvertisementCommunity Guidelines • FAQsAdvertisementAdvertisementPartner CenterAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementMost PopularAdvertisementI got my COVID-19 vaccination.
