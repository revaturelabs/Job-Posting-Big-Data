Many other websites require candidates to fill out profiles when they create an account, search through thousands of unrelated job posts, and when they finally find you, often the website requires them to set up login in credentials and/or fill out that profile information yet again. As a result, many candidates abandon the process in frustration.We built muniJOBS as a solution for these problems, a way to compress the candidate search experience into a single cohesive, interactive, and effective platform available to anyone looking for candidates in a municipal field.Boasting fully searchable job postings and the ability to track applications, correspond, and set up interviews, muniJOBS provides access to a pool of municipal talent that can fill any job cost effectively – one website, one fee, every opportunity to succeed. In the video below you’ll quickly see the process to set up your Employer Profile is both simple and intuitive offering you the ability to showcase your municipality and all your available jobs in one convenient location, directly to the candidates who want to find municipal work.After you’ve set up your profile, you’ll be able to post all your available jobs cost-effectively – plus search for and recruit candidates from the platform. This saves time for both parties providing a streamlined, 100% municipally-focused platform that benefits both candidates and employers.With nearly two million college students graduating in the next year and 51% of current municipal employees eligible for early retirements in 2021, now is the time to plan for the future with muniJOBS.As always, if you have any questions or would like to see a demo of muniJOBS, please email us at info@munijobs.ca or speak to an agent using the chat feature on www.munijobs.communiJOBS – simplify your recruitment!Leave us a comment Cancel replySave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.Job SeekersHomeAbout UsBlogContact UsFrequently Asked QuestionsTop CategoriesEducationHireHuman ResourcesInformationjobsLearnMunicipalMunicipal AssociationRecruitmentSkillUncategorizedFollow UsFacebookTwitterLinkedinHomeAbout UsBlogContact UsFrequently Asked Questions© 2019 muniJOBS All rights reserved.Back to top"
