We are looking for a veterinarian who is open to new ideas and who will enjoy being part of a team process that involves both support staff and pet parents.Work Smarter, Not HarderOur focus is on quality, consistency, and efficiency. We employ a system-based approach that provides a consistent pet parent experience and trained support staff to help with the process. Our licensed veterinary technicians and assistants handle anesthetic monitoring and adjustments, blood draws and catheter placement. They also support doctors by handling callbacks and record keeping. Our goal is for everyone in our office (including doctors) to leave at closing time to enjoy their evenings and weekends.High-Quality MedicineOur state-of-the-art facility boasts the newest high-tech equipment and a hospital layout designed to both maximize efficiency and promote a healthy and positive work environment. The Pet Health building includes a dedicated Zen room for acupuncture, a rehabilitation room for our orthopedic patients, and a newly remodeled dental suite. Our hospital has an open floor plan with floor-to-ceiling windows in both our surgical suite and doctor’s office to provide natural sunlight for our employees.We schedule 60-minute appoints to allow for a comprehensive medical history and physical exam that is not rushed, and we don’t practice medicine à la carte, such as optional bloodwork for procedures. Our philosophy is simple: What we would do for our own pets is what we recommend to our pet parents.Great Pet ParentsThe Pet Health focus is the pet parent who is looking for something different and better. In a crowded low-cost market, we excel through our passion for high-quality medicine and unparalleled customer service. We deliver a valued service and charge appropriately for what we do. This has allowed us to establish an educated clientele that is willing to work up cases.Pet InsuranceEducating our pet parents about pet insurance for their pets is a cornerstone of how we practice. Having our pet patients on pet insurance allows for a medical workup based on what you recommend for the specific disease condition instead of what the pet parent can afford. We have become one of the most successful practices in the country with Trupanion pet insurance based on our total number of active pet insurance enrolments. To streamline the insurance process, we have our support staff handle claims for our pet parents and we use Trupanion Express to determine immediately if a condition is covered, which enables our pet parents to pay only for what they owe.MentorshipEducation and training are important for both our support staff and associate veterinarians. Part of our culture is working together as a team on cases and staying updated on the latest advancements in disease conditions and treatments. We provide generous continuing education experiences in specialized areas, including acupuncture, rehabilitation, ultrasound, and dentistry. Finally, we also offer mentoring on the business aspects of a veterinary practice if you’re interested in owning or managing a practice of your own.Work to LiveWe value the need to balance personal and professional fulfillment by providing flexible options and no emergency duties. We are closed on Sundays, and our associate veterinarians work an average of 15 days per month. We want you to love your work, and part of that comes from not being at work all the time.Integrative MedicineAs more people are exploring alternative therapies for themselves, pet parents are looking for the same type of care for their pets. Our goal is to offer modern Western medicine in conjunction with alternative therapies that are supported by high-quality scientific evidence. Acupuncture, laser therapy and medical massage provide our pet parents with drug-free and surgery-free treatment options for their pets’. This integrative model is part of our lifetime care philosophy that promises more time, personalized care and attention, and a broad, holistic approach to healing.Pushing the Status QuoPet Health was built on the premise that there is a better way to deliver pet medical care. Among our services our pet parents love are our customized, breed-specific, lifetime-care programs, visual presentation for disease conditions in the rooms during the exams, and text-message updates for our pet parents during procedures. Our goal is not to be just another business with a vision statement, but rather a truly visionary organization.CompensationWe take pride in offering competitive compensation and a comprehensive benefits package that includes medical, paid vacation, paid continuing education, and a generous personal pet care plan. We also offer relocation reimbursement options.To learn more about Pet Health, check out our website at www.PetHealthHospital.com or see what our pet parents are saying about us on Yelp!Please feel free to email your resume to drb@pethealthhospital.comNOTES:Additional Salary Information: + Quarterly BonusCreate a Job Alert for Similar JobsAbout Pet HealthAt Pet Health our focus is on the lifetime care of your pet.
