I always purchased padded bras for the appearance of larger/fuller breasts. Bathing suits were the worst. This past summer I decided, I finally had enough and had the surgery. Now I feel comfortable wearing tank tops and clothes that fit your body. The day I was able to throw all those padded bras away was a GREAT day! Dr. Kreegel and his staff did a wonderful job!Celia MSearch for:Located AtDolls Plastic Surgery, LLC.18205 Biscayne Blvd #100Aventura, FL 33160(305) 995-0545Location & DirectionsContact Us or Schedule A Consultation(305) 995-0545Office HoursM-F 9:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m.Located AtDolls Plastic Surgery, LLC.18205 Biscayne Blvd #100Aventura, FL 33160Get DirectionsCancellation PolicyContactFees & FinancingFacebookInstagramTranslate Â»"
