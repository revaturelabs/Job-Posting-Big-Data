Each delegate must have a laptop and download the recommended software (QGIS) prior to the course.If you are working in the environmental sector or you are an enthusiastic wildlife recorder, then it is vital that you know about GIS (geographic information systems). This intermediate course will build on what you learnt in the introductory course and we will go into more detail about how to run environmental analyses, in particular to do with habitat suitability.The morning session will be spent in the classroom discussing the practical elements of using this technology. You will then put this knowledge into practice. Using SWT tablets, you will complete a data collection exercise in the woods which will then be downloaded and analysed on your personal laptop.While the course officially finishes at 3pm, from previous experience we have found that completing these final tasks can take much longer.
