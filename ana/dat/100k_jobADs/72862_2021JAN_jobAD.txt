My friend said I should get someone in to do it for me but I don’t know what the state of them is. I’m worried I’ll be wasting money hiring someone. Are there any tools I can buy to clear them from the ground (not good with heights) or should I bite the bullet and get someone in?Asked by Patrick on 20th May 2020Share this questionRoundwood Services\"An annual job is ideal Patrick! That way it avoids any potential build-up which could lead to further issues.But yes, it is very simple to do yourself with the right tools; otherwise a tradesman wouldn’t charge a huge fee..\"Answered on 20th May 2020 - Member since Mar 2019 - reportWas this answer helpful? 0Thistle Property Maintenance\"Get someone in to clean and inspect they could also paint the eves etc\"Answered on 27th May 2020 - Member since Jan 2017 - reportWas this answer helpful? 0Multitrade\"Only way to check guttering is look at them from above it’s up to you if you look or some one else\"Answered on 21st May 2020 - Member since Apr 2020 - reportWas this answer helpful? 0Gary William\"This job is easy enough to do yourself, but if, as you say, you're not good with ladders, it's best to have them done by someone with the right kit. Should be less than a day's work. Should cost less than £200 and no broken bones for you!\"Answered on 21st May 2020 - Member since Feb 2020 - reportWas this answer helpful? 0PEARCE roofing\"They cannot be cleaned from the ground will require a ladder\"Answered on 10th Jun 2020 - Member since Jun 2020 - reportWas this answer helpful? 0Fatboijohnny\"Personally it is very easy get a ladder up there and remove the moss with a little scraper, and twigs etc, I found a tennis ball in mine.Overtime they get blocked especially in autumn when leaves fall of trees etc so it's important to look after them annually. A handyman could do it with just water sponge and a scraper but due to working at heights may charge a little extra\"Answered on 20th May 2020 - Member since Feb 2020 - reportWas this answer helpful? 0DRIVE REFURBS\"you would be better paying someone too come in and do the job safely and quickly rather than yourself\"Answered on 20th May 2020 - Member since Jul 2019 - reportWas this answer helpful? 0Euan Mcgillveray joinery service\"The dealing with heights aspect is what you pay for.Trying to do from the ground could end up messy, or breaking guttering.\"Answered on 22nd May 2020 - Member since Feb 2020 - reportWas this answer helpful? 0LDT ELECTRICAL LTD.\"Yes need a trowel and bucket and a good set of ladders\"Answered on 20th May 2020 - Member since May 2020 - reportWas this answer helpful? 03D Roofing & Property Maintenance\"Anything with works at height you should get someone in to do the job that is trained and competent to do the worksRegards Dan\"Answered on 13th Jun 2020 - Member since Aug 2019 - reportWas this answer helpful? 0Ask a TradeGot a question that only a tradesperson can answer?
