This can also be expressed asemf = emf 0 sin ωt , size 12{\"emf\"=\"emf\" rSub { size 8{0} } \"sin\"ωt} {}whereemf 0 = NAB ω size 12{\"emf\" rSub { size 8{0} } = ital \"NAB\"ω} {}is the maximum (peak) emf . Note that the frequency of the oscillation is f = ω / 2π size 12{f=ω/2π} {} , and the period is T = 1 / f = 2π / ω size 12{T=1/f=2π/ω} {} . [link] shows a graph of emf as a function of time, and it now seems reasonable that AC voltage is sinusoidal.The emf of a generator is sent to a light bulb with the system of rings and brushes shown. The graph gives the emf of the generator as a function of time. emf 0 size 12{\"emf\" rSub { size 8{0} } } {} is the peak emf. The period is T = 1 / f = 2π / ω size 12{T=1/f=2π/ω} {} , where f size 12{f} {} is the frequency. Note that the script E stands for emf.The fact that the peak emf, emf 0 = NAB ω size 12{\"emf\" rSub { size 8{0} } = ital \"NAB\"ω} {} , makes good sense. The greater the number of coils, the larger their area, and the stronger the field, the greater the output voltage. It is interesting that the faster the generator is spun (greater ω size 12{ω} {} ), the greater the emf. This is noticeable on bicycle generators—at least the cheaper varieties. One of the authors as a juvenile found it amusing to ride his bicycle fast enough to burn out his lights, until he had to ride home lightless one dark night.[link] shows a scheme by which a generator can be made to produce pulsed DC. More elaborate arrangements of multiple coils and split rings can produce smoother DC, although electronic rather than mechanical means are usually used to make ripple-free DC.Split rings, called commutators, produce a pulsed DC emf output in this configuration.Calculating the maximum emf of a generatorCalculate the maximum emf, emf 0 size 12{\"emf\" rSub { size 8{0} } } {} , of the generator that was the subject of [link] .StrategyOnce ω size 12{ω} {} , the angular velocity, is determined, emf 0 = NAB ω size 12{\"emf\" rSub { size 8{0} } = ital \"NAB\"ω} {} can be used to find emf 0 size 12{\"emf\" rSub { size 8{0} } } {} . All other quantities are known.SolutionAngular velocity is defined to be the change in angle per unit time:ω = Δ θ Δ t . size 12{ω= { {Δθ} over {Δt} } } {}One-fourth of a revolution is π/2 size 12{l} {} radians, and the time is 0.0150 s; thus,ω = π / 2 rad 0.0150 s = 104 . 7 rad/s .104.7 rad/s is exactly 1000 rpm. We substitute this value for ω size 12{ω} {} and the information from the previous example into emf 0 = NAB ω size 12{\"emf\" rSub { size 8{0} } = ital \"NAB\"ω} {} , yieldingemf 0 = NAB ω = 200 ( 7 . 85 × 10 − 3 m 2 ) ( 1 . 25 T ) ( 104 . 7 rad/s ) = 206 V . alignl { stack { size 12{\"emf\" rSub { size 8{0} } = ital \"NAB\"ω} {} #\" \"=\"200\" \\( 7 \".\" \"85\" times \"10\" rSup { size 8{ - 3} } \" m\" rSup { size 8{2} } \\) \\( 1 \".\" \"25\"\" T\" \\) \\( \"104\" \".\" 7\" rad/s\" \\) {} # \" \"=\"206\"\" V\" {}} } {}DiscussionThe maximum emf is greater than the average emf of 131 V found in the previous example, as it should be.In real life, electric generators look a lot different than the figures in this section, but the principles are the same. The source of mechanical energy that turns the coil can be falling water (hydropower), steam produced by the burning of fossil fuels, or the kinetic energy of wind. [link] shows a cutaway view of a steam turbine; steam moves over the blades connected to the shaft, which rotates the coil within the generator.Steam turbine/generator. The steam produced by burning coal impacts the turbine blades, turning the shaft which is connected to the generator. (credit: Nabonaco, Wikimedia Commons)Generators illustrated in this section look very much like the motors illustrated previously. This is not coincidental. In fact, a motor becomes a generator when its shaft rotates. Certain early automobiles used their starter motor as a generator. In Back Emf , we shall further explore the action of a motor as a generator.Questions & Answerswhere we get a research paper on Nano chemistry....?Maira Replynanopartical of organic/inorganic / physical chemistry , pdf / thesis / reviewAliJoin the discussion...Replywhat are the products of Nano chemistry?Maira ReplyThere are lots of products of nano chemistry...
