Having a DOT helmet on that day saved me. The gate hit my helmet and pushed me further down the starting hill. The helmet cracked, but I had no head injuries. I started asking my friends on the track why it is important to wear a helmet. My mom helped me turn this into the video above. Whenever I see people (kids AND adults) without helmets it bothers me. That is not safe! I am hoping my message will reach many people.
