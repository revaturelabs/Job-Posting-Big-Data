As an experienced job seeker, there's nothing I dislike more than ready cheesy interview tips which tell you exactly how to behave. My last post on the importance of body language in an interview offered some useful tips on the non-verbal signals you give out during the interview process. This post focuses on tips which you don't hear everyday. It's common knowledge that you shouldn't chew gum during an interview, but unless you have your head in the clouds you could deduce this using common sense and…	Comments Off on Three Interview Tips You Don’t Hear Everyday	June 27, 2020	General	The Signs of Alcoholism In the WorkplaceAlcoholism is defined as an alcohol use disorder where an affected person is dependent on the consumption of alcohol. Alcohol affects the body by inhibiting coordination and judgement due to messages from the brain to the body being slowed. An alcoholic is dependent on alcohol both physically and psychologically. It is a disease which involves uncontrolled consumption of alcohol. A worker who has consumed alcohol will have poor health and wellbeing and will have a reduced work output. They may experience poor memory, low concentration and poor physical health which will affect their work.

If you're unemployed, or looking to switch things up a bit in your career, you might be interested in finding out how to become self-employed. There's no sense in applying for government funding if you don't know what you want to have a business in. Being your own boss has its perks, but you'll lose interest quickly if you don't have a solid goal and business plan in mind. So, before you try to finance your new business, it's imperative to consider the specifics of it. This…	Comments Off on How To Create A Business Plan	March 1, 2019	General	Gender Inequality in the WorkplaceIn October of last year, the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault allegations story broke in The New Yorker. The publicity surrounding this scandal has caused a lot of questions to be asked about women's position in modern society. In a time of supposed social progress, how is it that male authoritarian figures are still getting away with behavior like this? Almost as disturbing as the rape and unwanted touching accusations in the Weinstein story was the seeming complicity of his staff and colleagues. It is as much a moral stain on those who stayed silent as it is on Weinstein himself.…	Comments Off on Gender Inequality in the Workplace	December 1, 2018	General	Robots, Machines, and AutomationHi everyone! Hope you're having a great July. I'm in Florida and we've had some scary thunder and lightning that's as loud as fireworks! It's been a great month so far aside from that though. Anyway, this blog post is about...scary, foreboding music...drum roll...robots, machines, and automation. I just got a shiver down my spine thinking about the worrying progress of computers designed to act more and more like humans. Bladerunner eat your heart out. Machines that Learn Like People Part of the general wariness surrounding technological progress is a subconscious fear that machines will take over the world. This…	Comments Off on Robots, Machines, and Automation	July 1, 2018	General	Bizarre Global Trends: BitcoinWhat is Bitcoin? You may never have heard of it, but it's time you did. Bitcoin is taking the online marketplace by storm. But what is it? It's a form of digital currency: money you can't touch, feel, or smell, but money all the same. It is what's known as a 'crypto-currency': a digital cash system. It is also completely decentralized, meaning that it is not backed by a physical commodity (gold) or any government or bank. Japan has legalized crypto-currencies, and other countries will likely follow: just a few days ago (June 23rd) news of China developing its own…	Comments Off on Bizarre Global Trends: Bitcoin	June 1, 2018	General	UK Recruitment Trends 2017I've assessed a number of resources in order to find out the greatest range of 2017 recruitment trends for employees and employers alike. Read on to discover what challenges and benefits there are for job-hunters and hiring companies that look set to continue into 2018: Casual Hiring Bronwen Hann, President & Senior Partner at Argentus Supply Chain Recruiting, notes a trend of companies choosing to cash in on a 'gig economy'. According to Hann, 'more companies than ever are choosing to 'rent' rather than hire talent, even at the director level and above.'(1) Skills Shortage There is more competition than…	Comments Off on UK Recruitment Trends 2017	April 1, 2018	General	Trump’s Effect on Jobs in the UKLast Friday, the 20th of January, saw the inauguration of America's 45th President, Donald J. Trump. A controversial figure, Trump's campaign promised to bring manufacturing back to America and look after the American worker, who he felt had been severely let down by the Obama administration. I'm not here to tell you what I think about Trump. I'm here to tell you something much more relevant to recruitment. This post examines the effect of Trump's presidency on the UK job market. How will his inauguration directly affect British workers and job-seekers? Let's find out. I'm no stock market expert, but…	Comments Off on Trump’s Effect on Jobs in the UK	January 1, 2018	General	Post-Brexit Job MarketHappy September-almost-October everybody. This post is four days overdue. In case you hadn't noticed, they're supposed to be out on the 25th. Well, I have no reasonable explanation for why I didn't make the deadline this month. I actually just lost track of the date, and the only way I was reminded of it was checking the use-by on sausages in the fridge. Anyway, last month I promised to be more specific about the impact of Brexit on the job front, so here it is.
