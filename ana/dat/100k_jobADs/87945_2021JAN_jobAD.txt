It is actually a liquid wax that is slightly nutty in flavor. Yes, it is edible but non-caloric since it is not absorbed. It is mainly used in cosmetics. It became popular in the 1970s as a replacement for whale oil. It is quite shelf stable because it does not have triglycerides and does not become rancid. However, it is still best to store the jojoba in a dark and cool place and to keep the bottle tightly sealed.It is a natural fungicide and is therefore ideal as a base in products used for itchy skin. Normally, one takes the wax and mixes it with essential oils of choice. Think of it as a base for cosmetics, hair tonics, bath scents, and cremes used on the skin to relieve itchiness, acne, or irritations. You choose the essential oil and dilute it in the jojoba. About 20-25 drops of essential oil can be used with the jojoba in our four ounce bottle.Why not start with Owyhee Essential Oil?Contents: Cold Pressed seeds from wildcrafted jojoba.Weight8 ozDimensions6 × 3 × 3 inReviews	There are no reviews yet.Only logged in customers who have purchased this product may leave a review.You may also like…Anti-Parasitic	Owyhee Essential Oil, Wildcrafted, 5 ml.$12.00 Add to cartRelated productsAntimicrobial	Tamanu Oil, certified organic, 30 ml.$21.10 Add to cartCarrier Oils for DIY Projects	Neem Oil, Certified Organic, 4 oz.$16.75 Add to cartCarrier Oils for DIY Projects	Sweet Almond Oil, Certified Organic, 4 oz.$16.75 Add to cartPoulsbo, Washington 98370Contact us© Copyright Sacred Medicine Sanctuary 2020For permission to quote, reprint, translate, or reproduce in any digital or print format, please use the contact form on this site.InformationContact UsFAQCopyright ProtectionPermission to QuotePrivacy PolicyAdvanced SearchOrdering from UsDomestic ShippingInternational ShippingLIbrary OrdersWholesale PricingTranslation & ForeignDistribution{{{ data.variation.price_html }}}{{{ data.variation.availability_html }}}"
