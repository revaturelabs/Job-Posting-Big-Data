Or at least dress like him.One of Jobs' famous black turtlenecks is going up for auction at Julien's Live, a Hollywood-favorite auction house that has sold collections previously owned by Michael Jackson, Marilyn Monroe and Frank Sinatra, to name a few.Once owned by the Apple co-founder, the black Vantage brand turtleneck features the NeXT company logo printed on the front, while the back reads \"1980s: Personal Computing/1990s: Interpersonal Computing.\" Bidding starts at $500 and is currently at $1000. It's said to be valued at $1000 to $3000.Jobs' desire to make turtlenecks part of his daily uniform came together after the tech genius visited Japan in the 1980s and saw that all the employees at Sony were wearing a uniform, which was designed by Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake. After trying to suggest uniforms for Apple (which Jobs had reached out to Miyake to design) and receiving backlash from employees, Jobs kept in touch with Miyake and asked him to make his classic turtlenecks. Turns out he received \"hundreds of them,\" so many that he said he had \"enough to last for the rest of my life.\"In case you can't get your hands on this particular look, the auction house is also offering Jobs' Versace shirt (bidding starts at $200), his set of various keys (starts at $100) and a Sony CD player (starts at $100).FACEBOOKTWITTEREMAIL METHR staffthrnews@thr.com @thrThe Hollywood ReporterÂ© 2021 The Hollywood Reporter, LLC.
