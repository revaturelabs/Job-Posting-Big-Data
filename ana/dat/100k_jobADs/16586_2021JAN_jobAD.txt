Her background as a recovering alcoholic and drug addict gave her personal insight into her work.The application seemed little more than a formality. But then she had to answer: Have you been convicted of a felony in the past seven years?Katz’s substance abuse had been intertwined with a long criminal history that had ended more than six years earlier when she was convicted for possession of cocaine. When she checked the box, the county automatically rejected her application.“I’m really strong in my recovery,” said Katz, now clean for almost eight years. “But it just made me feel like what’s the use? Why bother?”It’s an experience that countless people with convictions encounter each year, as otherwise qualified applicants are turned away from jobs because of past wrongdoing.Katz, however, quickly landed on her feet. She got a job as a program director for the Portland-based nonprofit Partnership for Safety and Justice, where she has focused, in part, on convincing governments and businesses to drop the conviction question from initial job applications.This month, the organization scored its first major success when Multnomah County agreed to remove the question “Have you ever been convicted of a felony?” from its standard application.“The county is in the business of rehabilitating offenders,” said Travis Graves, county human resources director. “We’re not really walking our talk if we have processes that discourage people from even applying for jobs.”Instead, interviewers will ask applicants later in the hiring process about convictions, giving people a chance to tell their story. Graves said staff members should consider the age when the crime was committed, the time elapsed since the crime, the nature of the crime and positive changes the applicant has made.The question will remain on applications for jobs that require a clean record, such as probation officers, Graves said.“We’re not saying conviction history shouldn’t be considered at all,” said David Rogers, executive director of the Partnership for Safety and Justice. “We’re saying it shouldn’t be considered on the initial job application because we don’t want people to be indiscriminately screened out and we don’t want to discourage people who could be the most qualified applicant from applying.”Some major cities — including Chicago, Boston and San Francisco — have adopted similar laws. But the question remains standard at many businesses and governments. Clackamas County, for example, asks any job applicants who have been convicted of any offense as an adult, other than a minor traffic offense, to fill out a separate criminal conviction disclosure form.Rogers said the nonprofit will lobby for similar changes to state law and possibly at other government agencies and private businesses.Comments»no comments yet - be the first?messagename email urlsearchAdmin ControlsLog inRecent PostsFAMM’s next steps in the courtsUnanimous U.S. Supreme Court Issued a Decision Allowing Judges More Freedom When Deciding Prison SentencesHonoring Our VeteransCongress Is Trying To Make Mandatory Minimum Drug Sentences WorseRally To Reform Measure 11Sentencing Reform is Alive and WellBill advances that would give a break to some young sex offendersYoung Offenders Moving ForwardOregon commission considers easing Measure 11 sentences to spare more prison constructionHarsh Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Law ExamplePollsHow Is My Site?ExcellentGoodBadCan Be ImprovedNo CommentsView ResultsLoading ...Polls ArchiveCategoriesCurrent NewsEffects of Measure 11Moving ForwardThe BillYour HelpArchiveJanuary 2019April 2017November 2016June 2016February 2016February 2015May 2013March 2013December 2012October 2012September 2012August 2012July 2012June 2012April 2012February 2012January 2012December 2011November 2011October 2011September 2011August 2011July 2011June 2011May 2011April 2011March 2011February 2011January 2011December 2010November 2010October 2010September 2010August 2010July 2010June 2010May 2010April 2010March 2010February 2010January 2010December 2009November 2009October 2009September 2009August 2009July 2009June 2009May 2009April 2009March 2009February 2009December 2008November 2008October 2008September 2008August 2008July 2008June 2008April 2008March 2008February 2008January 2008December 2007November 2007October 2007September 2007August 2007July 2007June 2007May 2007April 2007March 2007February 2007January 2007December 2006November 2006September 2006Blog RollOregon Mandatory Min Sentencing Law Measure 11Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM)The Sentencing ProjectPrisonSucks.comBlog Flux DirectoryPartnership for Safety and JusticeThe Real Cost of Prisons ProjectOregon Department of CorrectionsOregon Measure 11 online chat groupSentencing Law and PolicyMetaLog inValid XHTMLXFNFeedsFullComments© 2011-2017 Oregonians Against Measure 11Regulus by Ben @ Binary MoonCreated with WordPressTop"
