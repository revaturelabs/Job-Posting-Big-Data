A career as a Registered Social Security Analyst is your answer!Similar to a Financial Advisor (FA) or a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), a Registered Social Security Analyst (RSSA) assists individual clients with making informed decisions in order to maximize their retirement benefits.A RSSA is not just a job. It’s a personally and financially rewarding career. Registered Social Security Analysts have the ability to earn exceptional revenue simply by helping others determine their best strategy for their Social Security contributions in order to get the most from them in the long run.Why Are RSSAs Necessary?Ever since the Social Security Administration was formed in 1935 to provide retirement benefits to vested contributors, the system has been confusing for most people. Unless someone is a trained financial advisor or analyst, it can be difficult to find answers to some questions like, “can I get benefits from an ex-spouse,” or “what are benefit options for dependents with disabilities.” But even the answer to the most common question, “when should I claim my Social Security” can be hard to find.Here’s a scary fact: 96% of people don’t claim at the optimal time and an average of $111,000 per household is lost because of this. The truth is most people just assume that they have little control over what is taken out of their paychecks for Social Security.The RSSA program was developed to put advisors in place to help consumers better understand the best options for their specific situations. With the assistance of RSSAs, people will have expert guidance that will positively impact their financial wellbeing.
