And the impact of that doesn't even bear thinking about....Did you know that turtles mistake floating bags for jellyfish and gobble them up filling their stomachs with indigestible plastics? Or that British seabirds take in broken up pieces mistaking them for fish.The oceans are big, huge, even incomprehensible in scope so how do we get rid of all the plastic, decrease the 'floating garbage patches' - the biggest is in the Pacific ocean and estimates of its size from 1/4 million square miles to over five million.

Find out more about his solution and his company, the Ocean Cleanup here: www.theoceancleanup.comHe emphasizes: “Although a cleanup will have a profound effect, it is just part of the solution. We also need to close the tap, to prevent any more plastic from reaching the oceans in the first place.”It's not just bags of course, it's everything plastic, bottles, wrappers, plastic lighters, plastic light fittings, electronic equipment, microscopic beads in cosmetics but how do we know which is worst, most prevalent?MCS are looking at just that, by comparing data from the regular beach cleans they can see what's washing ashore.Find out more about the problem plastic present and what you can do to help by reading their lead article in our most recent CJS Focus.ShareGet
