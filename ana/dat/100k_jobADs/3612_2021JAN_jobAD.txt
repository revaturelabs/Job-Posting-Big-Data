[ethical Professor Steven Salaita who lost his job because of his comments on Israel’s attack on Gaza-no job is worth SUCKING UP TO JEWISH PRESSURE and intimidation]http://www.palestine-info.co.ukhttp://www.intifada-palestine.comhttp://occupiedpalestine.wordpress.comhttp://uprootedpalestinians.blogspot.comhttp://www.middleeasteye.net/http://alethonews.wordpress.comhttp://theuglytruth.wordpress.comhttp://www.ascertainthetruth.com==================================Massive artillery shelling may have caused numerous civilian fatalities in GazaIt is thought that at least 32,000 artillery shells were fired during Protective Edge, four times as much as in Cast Lead in 2008.==========================================Why Israel Killed so Many Pregnant Women in Gazahttp://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article39432.htmBy Robin BesteAfter five weeks of Israeli bombing and invasion the United Nations reported that the death toll in Gaza was 1,973, 72% of them civilians, including 459 children and 238 women.Not included in that figure were the nine unborn children that Israel killed.Three pregnant mothers were among the 25 members of the Abu Jamaa family who were killed on 20 July, when Israeli forces struck a house near Khan Younis, without warning. The dead included 18 children and five women. The family was eating iftar, the meal that breaks the Ramadan fast.Just as this family was being slaughtered, by an indisputable Israeli war crime, the US secretary of state John Kerry gave an interview in which he said, Israel's attack on Gaza was an \"appropriate and legitimate effort\" to defend itself.A little earlier in the day, Kerry's boss, President Obama, repeated his \"strong support for Israel's right to defend itself\".Obama gave this green light to Israel, \"after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu earlier in the day\". Predictably, Netanyahu was soon all over the media crowing about US support for Israel's indiscriminate bombardment of the most densely populated place on Earth, and announcing that Israel planned to intensify the carnage in Gaza over the coming days.At a press conference on 3 August, Netanyahu praised the United States for its \"terrific support\" and Obama for his \"unequivocal stand with Israel on our right to defend ourselves\".Britain's prime minister David Cameron also spoke regularly to Netanyahu, to whom he repeated \"our recognition of Israel's right to take proportionate action to defend itself\".Whether it was 'proportionate' to kill 459 children, or four boys playing football on a beach, or 25 family members as they sat down for a meal, David Cameron hasn't said. Was it 'proportionate to litter the streets of the Shujai'iya dictrict in Gaza City with dozens of bodies of mainly women and children, after it had been effectively carpet-bombed? Was it 'proportionate' to bomb hospitals and a home for the disabled? David Cameron didn't say.Cameron said he had asked Netanyahu \"to do everything to avoid civilian casualties, to exercise restraint\".This clearly did not include restraining from sending the world's fifth most powerful military force to invade a tiny area, just 25 miles long and just a few miles wide, into which are crammed 1.8 million people, who have been held captive in a brutal siege for seven years, that has deprived the inhabitants of food, power, access to clean water, a functioning sewage system, medical supplies and other essential resources.Israel's justification for killing so many civilians is the claim that Hamas is using civilians as human shields for its rockets and fighters. These same accusations, were made in 2008 and 2009 during Israel's Operation Cast Lead bombing of Gaza and were found to be without evidence by Amnesty International.Israeli spokesman Mark Regev has been given free rein by the mainstream media to repeat this accusation, despite journalists like the BBC's Jeremy Bowen reporting that they \"saw no evidence of Hamas using Palestinians as human shields.\"In fact, the human shields' argument is a complete myth, which is why Israel has produced no evidence to support it. It is the reason Israel gave for the missile attack on a home for the disabled in Beit Lahiya, killing two disabled residents and injuring four others. Jamilla Alaiwa, a 59 year old social worker who founded the home, said,. \"If the Israelis have proof of this let them make it public. There was no one from Islamic Jihad or Hamas living there. We are not involved in politics.\"No Palestinian civilian has been found to corroborate Israel's claim they are being forced by Hamas to become unwilling human shields. Why then, says Israel, do people stay in their homes when we drop leaflets telling them to evacuate because we are about to bomb? Abdullah al-Daweish, a relative of the family of five killed in Khan Younis, explains:“Where do we go to? Some people moved from the outer edge of Khan Younis to Khan Younis centre after Israelis told them to, then the centre got bombed. People have moved from this area to Gaza City, and Gaza City has been bombed. It’s not Hamas who is ordering us in this, it’s the Israelis.”The United Nations said on 22 July that 43% of the Gaza population had been affected by evacuation or no-go area warnings from Israel. By the beginning of August, the number of displaced Gaza residents was over half a million.Over 200,000 Palestinians fled to centres set up by the United Nations. A total of 344 babies were born in UN schools designated as shelters.But even here they were not safe, with the UN relief agency reporting that six of its facilities, including three schools were struck by Israeli shells. On 22 July at least 15 Palestinians sheltering in a UN school were killed and 200 injured, most of them women and children. UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon called the attack a war crime. But this didn't stop Israel attacking another UN school a week later, this time killing a further 17 civilians.Even the United States, supplier of the shells that did the killing, felt it needed to call the attack \"disgraceful\", but at the same time it was rushing arms to Israel as its munitions stocks were running low, so much of it used to devastate Gaza.The British government was shown to be no slouch either in supplying arms to Israel, when it was revealed that UK manufactured weapons and components were being used in Israel's current assault, including drone technology that the Israeli airforce described as the \"backbone\" of its targeting and reconnaissance missions.With the borders of Gaza sealed by the Israeli and Egyptian siege, no wonder the desperate response from its people -- as Israel bombarded the whole area by land, sea and air -- was, where else is there for us to go?Nowhere, is the reply for the two families -- eleven people -- killed overnight on 23 July. A distraught man told the BBC how his dead relatives there had been relocated twice, first from Beit Hanoun and then from Shujai'iya, areas that received Israeli evacuation orders.Netanyahu says another reason for so many civilians being killed by Israel, is because Hamas wants to \"pile up as many civilian dead as they can to make Israel look bad. They use telegenically dead Palestinians for their cause. They want the more dead, the better.\"Netanyahu was allowed to make this despicable accusation without challenge on the mainstream media news broadcasts. But \"the more dead the better\" is certainly the view of not a few Israelis, including the member of the Israeli parliament, Ayelet Shaked, who said recently,\"Behind every terrorist stand dozens of men and women, without whom he could not engage in terrorism. They are all enemy combatants, and their blood shall be on all their heads. Now this also includes the mothers of the martyrs, who send them to hell with flowers and kisses. They should follow their sons, nothing would be more just. They should go, as should the physical homes in which they raised the snakes. Otherwise, more little snakes will be raised there.\"Put a little less graphically, Israeli army major general Oren Shachor, explained: “If we kill their families, that will frighten them.”So, is the reason so many pregnant women were killed in Gaza because Israel believes they were acting as human shields for unborn 'terrorists'?When an Israeli air strike killed an expectant mother in the early hours of 23 July, Gaza health officials told the BBC how they tried to rescue the baby from the dead mother, only for the child to die. No doubt two deaths welcomed by Ayelet Shaked and major general Shachor.Source: Stop the War Coalition======================Israeli War Crimes in GazaBy Jim MilesWhat kind of God would permit this?

How come they are not running for the ‘bomb’ shelters. Perhaps Hamas should target these cold blooded spectators arrogantly and so full of racism, laughing at the deaths of Civilians. Israel society truly is born out of EVIL, no heart, no soul.Blood Thirst: 'Finish The Job!' Of Killing Palestinians—Thousands of Israelis rally in support of Gaza offenseThousands of people in Tel Aviv rallied to show support for the IDF's military campaign in Gaza, urging the government forces to stop Hamas rocket attacks on Israel once and for all.An estimated 10,000 Israelis gathered in Rabin Square for first major demonstration since Operation Protective Edge began on July 8, officially to protect Israeli civilians from the barrage of rockets launched from the militant organization on the Gaza strip.WHAT GIVES THE BASTARD STATE OF ISRAEL THE RIGHT TO CALL ANYONE ILLEGITIMATE?Israel …..A State that has NOT stood on its own financially since its inceptionA State that has ignored EVERY UN Sanction against it since its inceptionA State that has sent spies to the very nations that have kept her aliveA State has displace millions of people from their homes and propertiesA State that, in this decade alone, has murdered thousands of innocent civilians including women and childrenYET, this is how the zionists portray the latest events …==============================================CODE PINK TO PROTEST LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION BLAMING HAMAS FOR GAZA WARAugust 14, 2014This is crazy. How can the LA City Council even consider a resolution focusing on Hamas instead of the crimes committed by the Israeli government that killed over 2,000 Palestinians?? We hear it said that Gaza is an open-air prison, but prisoners get at least minimal food, security and heathcare. We must stand against this resolution and let the City Council know this would be a racist and violent move.Join us this Friday, August 15th at 8:15 AM – At Los Angeles City Hall Main Steps.The Intergovernmental Relations Committee of the Los Angeles City Council is set to meet on Friday, August 15 at 9AM to consider an outrageous resolution that condemns Hamas and fails to mention Israeli war crimes. The resolution turns reality on its head by implying that Israel is the victim, when in fact it is the engaged in brutal occupation, mass killing of civilians and scores of war crimes. The resolution is an attempt to obscure the truth.Wrh.com Webmaster's Commentary:This announcement was sent out as an email and does not yet appear on the Codepink website yet, but the LA City Council, apparently with nothing better to do in the taxpayer dollar than suck up to Israel, is considering a resolution that would drop the blame for 5 weeks of Israel's attacks on Gaza squarely on HAMAS.Codepink is mobilizing a protest. I know there are a lot of protests going on, and maybe that is a good thing, but this is one you should make a point of getting to if you live in the Los Angeles area. If my wife and I still lived in North Hollywood, we would be heading down to this one ourselves!Let's review the timetable.In June, three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed in an IDF-controlled region of the West Bank, not Gaza. ISIS has taken credit and even the Israeli media admits that the two suspects named by the Israeli government are not part of HAMAS, but of a group known for disobeying HAMAS and trying to cause trouble for them.But Netanyahu declared HAMAS, the legally elected government of Gaza, responsible and launched bombing raids into Gaza using the very latest high-tech weapons provided by the US Government and paid for by the US taxpayers.To put Israel's actions into perspective, let us recall that over the July 4th weekend, 8 people were killed in Chicago. Using Netanyahu's logic, the Democratic party should be blamed and all of Illinois bombed and invaded!The Gazans, who were attacked without provocation, fought back with their home-made rockets, which so far have mostly knocked a few roof tiles loose.But to Israel's supporters, we should all forget that Israel attacked Gaza without a valid reason, and view Gaza's attempts to defend themselves as the crime, so that Israel can go on pounding the Palestinians with their superior weapons.I want to point something out. The Israelis sit in their tanks, or the drone operations centers, or fly high above Gaza in their US-supplied warplanes, dropping the latest in US-supplied high tech lethal munitions, and imagine themselves the heroes they read about in the Torah. The Israelis, clearly unafraid of HAMAS rockets, line the hills overlooking Gaza and cheer the carnage, much as the Romans at the Colosseum cheered as the Christians were thrown to the lions. The Gazans huddle in their giant open-air prison, without an army, a navy, or an air force, and fight back with home-made rockets made out of plumbing supplies.Not since Thermopylae has the world seen such courage in the face of overwhelming odds. The Gazans have balls the US and Israel can only dream of, and the world will remember their courage against the tyrants, and the lies by the corporate media's presstitutes and whorespondents trying to protect Israel's aggression, right alongside the Los Angeles City Council!===================================================Israeli Jew websiteEuropean Bombs Hit GazaComplicating Europe in the Gaza War, Israel disclosed that it used NATO weapons to attack Gaza while fighting the USA over the supply of Hellfire missiles. On the same day, August 15, a Dutch citizen returned to Israel his Righteous Among the Nations medal, after Zion killed his family in Gaza.American equipment reaches IDF soldiers via NATO, which keeps several warehouses within IDF facilities. Weapons, ammunitions, uniforms and other items are stored for the case that the Western Army is deployed in the Middle East. There is an understanding that in the case of emergency, Israel will take the items for the IDF.The locations are a well-kept secret. I saw two such bases. In both cases, my host had asked \"Do you know what this is?\" and answered without waiting \"It belongs to NATO.\" Probably a third one exists; veteran readers know that in this page are hints of what cannot be said.Every few years, items are refreshed. Old uniforms are not sent to Langley's Laundromat; instead they are given to the IDF, where soldiers fight for the right to put hands in the pockets while walking.In recent days, President Obama and PM Netanyahu are carrying a quite vocal struggle on Hellfire missiles for the IAF Apache helicopters.The USA wants to delay the sale of offensive weapons while Israel targets civilians. Now that Zanoli returned his medal, Israel wants to speed up its massacres and requests more missiles.This is an irrelevant fight. Nobody forces Israel to destroy Gaza with American helicopters. It has plenty of other bombs that can achieve the same destruction. Despite that, the topic is prominently featured from the Wall Street Journal to Haaretz.Due to the sensitivity of the topic let me be doctrinaire, and emphasize external details. On August 14, WSJ published an article entitled \"White House Now Scrutinizing Israeli Requests for Ammunition.\"The most-shocking paragraph in an otherwise boring piece claimed: \"On July 20, Israel's defense ministry asked the U.S. military for a range of munitions, including 120-mm mortar shells and 40-mm illuminating rounds, which were already kept stored at a pre-positioned weapons stockpile in Israel.\"The topic was confirmed today by Israeli portal walla! Both sources report that despite the political fight, the military echelons are cooperating as usual, and the request was answered positively \"via military-channels,\" walla! expanded.WSJ added that the mortars reached the IDF on July 30, the day when the UN school was bombed by Israel. Was the crime committed with mortars supplied by NATO?==============================================Israel Welcomes American And Canadian Recruits For The IDFby trevorlabontehttp://wp.me/p2dGk-hJVhttp://wp.me/p2dGk-hJVTrevor ed note-The millions of Palestinian refugees that were driven off of their lands by sheer zionist terrorism have no right of return, but any yay-hoo jew from any remote corner of the world is encouraged, welcomed, and PAID $$$ to show up out of the clear blue sky, kill Palestinians that they were never in a conflict with before, and steal their land, using as their sole justification the Old Testament, which says that's what Yahweh commands of his \"chosen people.\" Read more of this postBennett Calls to Unilaterally End Gaza OperationAs the Security Cabinet meeting in the Prime Minister's Residence in Jerusalem ended Friday morning, Cabinet member and Economics Minister Naftali Bennett (Jewish Home) called for Israel to unilaterally end Operation Protective Edge.The minister said Israel should stop the operation without an agreement with Hamas, allowing the IDF to continue actions against the terror tunnels in Gaza while easing the blockade of the Hamas terror enclave.=============================================A reminder from 2009, of the most ‘moral army in the world’ mindset, whose sickness is even worse than 2008/9Israeli Army T-Shirts Mock Gaza KillingsThe revelations centre on t-shirt designs made for soldiers that make light of shooting pregnant Palestinian mothers and children and include images of dead babies and destroyed mosques.The t-shirts were printed for Israeli soldiers at the end of periods of deployment or training courses and were discovered by Israeli newspaper Haaretz.One, printed for a platoon of Israeli snipers depicts an armed Palestinian pregnant women caught in the crosshairs of a rifle, with the disturbing caption in English: \"1 shot 2 kills\".Another depicts a child carrying a gun also in the centre of a target.\"The smaller, the harder,\" read the words on the t-shirt.According to a soldier interviewed by the newspaper, the message has a double meaning: \"It's a kid, so you've got a little more of a problem, morally and also the target is smaller.\"Another shows an Israeli soldier blowing up a mosque and reads \"Only God forgives\".Above a ninja figure, yet another shirt bears the slogan \"Won't chill until I confirm a kill\".The revelations, coming so soon after Israel's offensive in Gaza in which hundreds of civilians were killed - many of them women and children - are causing outrage.Perhaps the most shocking design shows a Palestinian mother weeping next to her dead baby's grave, also in the crosshairs of a rifle.It suggests it would have been better if the child had never been born, with the slogan \"Better use Durex\".The controversy follows more revelations by other soldiers about abuses and the shooting of civilians during Israel's offensive during the Gaza offensive.Ex-soldier and campaigner with Breaking The Silence, Michael Maniken, told Sky News Online this week's revelations suggest a pattern of immoral conduct in the army.\"We're hearing about this time and time again and the army seems disconnected from reality.\"A spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) told Sky News Online, the t-shirts were printed on the private initiative of the soldiers and their designs \"are not in accordance with IDF values and are simply tasteless. This type of humour is unacceptable and should be condemned==========================================================================look folks, let us get one thing straight here, Israel and its Hierarchy in the USA dictate to the their Black dog in the Black House, just as they dictate to their White dog in the UK’s Whitehall.Obama is just another programmed Zionist and thus he does what is expected of him, no matter that he is the figurehead ‘President’ of this Super Power country which in reality is and has been for a long time, Israeli/Zionist occupied, something I have stated so many times. Can you imagaine, White Ashkenazi Jew, Milikovsky Netanyahu taking orders form a servile Black half Jew/Gentile Zionist like Obama . Jewish power in the USA is 100% so is it any wonder that Netanyahu can go directly to the Pentagon with his orders for more Weapons, over riding the Jewish dominated White HouseWhat Israel demands, Israel gets as they all bend over backwards to comply, knowing full well what the implications are for them personally if they do not comply with ‘Yes sir, no Sir, 3 bags full sir’.Being the avowed dutiful Zionist that he is, and always has been, having after all been pre selected, groomed for this job, mentored by the likes of Rahm Emanuel, and Brezinski, Obomba is more than happy to give Israel everything it demands.‘Political ‘rift’ between them is just Political theatre- drama drummed up for the Press and the Public, to deceive us all into believing that the USA does not approve of Netanyahu’s meddling in US Political/Military affairs when in reality we know it to be the case and that Israel, under Rothcshild Mastership, rules and owns the USA, its Government, Senate, Congress, Military, Jewdiciary, Bankers/Corporations. That is FACT and Netanyahu can run as many circles around Obomba as he likes, knowing Israel will get what it demands, even if it goes against US Constitution and Laws.The same can be applied to Cameron and his decision of not sending anymore arms to Israel. Just who is kidding who here. This pathetic cabbage faced pipsqueak cannot go against Israel, just as Obomba cannot.Those that still imply that the USA has any control or power over Israel and its present Egotistic psychopath Prime Minister, is being disingenuous or ignorantly blind to this factAmid Obama-Netanyahu rift, Israel stockpiled weapons through back channelshttp://nypost.com/2014/08/14/amid-obama-netanyahu-rift-israel-stockpiles-weapons-through-back-channels/=======================================US: We will continue to provide military assistance to Israel:State Department Deputy Spokesperson Harf says 'there has been no change in policy' towards Israel, reiterates 'unshakeable commitment' to its security.SourcePrev	NextAdd commentName (required)E-mail (required, but will not display)WebsiteTitle (required)Notify me of follow-up commentsRefreshSendCancelJCommentsRelated ArticlesNEWS DIGEST: Will Russia blow 911 wide open?NEWS DIGEST: Congress Won’t Agree to Stop Arming Terrorists; Venezuela Slams OAS!NEWS DIGEST: Trump’s Son-In-Law Financed Israeli Extremists and SettlementsNEWS DIGEST: 1st U.S female Muslim judge found dead; President Kushner/Ist Lady IvankaNEWS DIGEST: Al Aqsa no longer yours says Israel;US-UN Turn Blind Eye To Israeli War CrimesNEWS DIGEST: Palestinians to Sue Israel for War CrimesNEWS DIGEST: Risking World War III in SyriaNEWS DIGEST: Hillary's Criminal Money MakingNEWS DIGEST: 9/11 Destroyed AmericaNEWS DIGEST: The White HelmetsNEWS DIGEST: BEWARE YE THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEESNEWS DIGEST: US COPS ON TRAINING MISSION IN ISRAELNEWS DIGEST: Russiaphobia-Symptoms of US ImplosionNEWS DIGEST: US Illegally Attacks Syria!NEWS DIGEST: SYRIA: Chemical attack '100 percent fabricationNEWS DIGEST: Black activists owe no apolgy to IsraelNEWS DIGEST: The Kurds & Egypt Mufti Slams Takfiri ISIL Militants!NEWS DIGEST: Putin Says He'll Prove Erdogan's Trafficking ISIS Oil; Erdogan Claims Will Resign If True...NEWS DIGEST: LIBERATING ALEPPO from ISIS Terrorists;Tears, Hugs,Smiles, Relief of Escaping East AleppoNEWS DIGEST: Assad is a victim of a false flag from CIANEWS DIGEST: Trump's Yemen policy IMMORAL, counter productiveNEWS DIGEST: 1668 Palestinians Holocausted by Israel, 9000 injured!NEWS DIGEST: Yemen Stands AloneFrance Nice False Flag ExposedNEWS DIGEST: Pathetic!
