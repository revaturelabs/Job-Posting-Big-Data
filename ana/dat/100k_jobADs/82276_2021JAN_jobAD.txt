Our bottleneck is delivery, and so we will be looking to scale up the team here. We have doubled in size, mostly tripled, and want to do that again.”CoreBlue already works closely with the University of Plymouth in a “complementary relationship”, offering internships that typically lead to full-time job offers.More than 80% of current staff have graduated from the university, and Mr Boyles-White said: “A lot of our developers came out of the University of Plymouth, and were on their computer science course. They have been good to us and we enjoy working with them.”Mr Boyles-White said about 70% of CoreBlue’s work comes from clients in London or abroad – including Europe, South America, Saudi Arabia, India and the USA - but being in the South West gives it a competitive edge.“We have an advantage that we can deliver very competitively into the market by being based in Plymouth,” he said. “We are not too far from London, but it’s more expensive to deliver in London.”Want more Plymouth business news straight to your inbox?BusinessLive South West is home for all your Plymouth business news as well as relevant stories from across the wider region.You can sign up to receive daily morning business bulletins and we'll send out breaking news alerts for any stories we think you can't miss.Visit our email preference centre to sign up to all the latest news from BusinessLive.How to contact William Telford and Business LiveBusiness Live's South West Business Reporter is William Telford.He is based in Plymouth but covers the entire region.To contact William:Email: william.telford@reachplc.comPhone: 01752 293116Mob: 07584 594052Twitter: @WTelfordHeraldLinkedIn: www.linkedin.comFacebook: www.facebook.com/william.telford.5473William has more than a decade's experience reporting on the business scene in Plymouth and the South West.To sign up for Business Live's daily newsletters click hereIn September 2020 CoreBlue was awarded £50,000 from Innovate UK to further develop the TutorHero machine learning tool, designed to help students catch up on studies lost during lockdown.Mr Boyes-White said educational tech is a growth area and said: “There is more funding to come, that is significant. We are investing heavily in educational tech.”Mr Boyles-White was born and bred in Plymouth and attended what was formerly known as The Ridgeway School. As managing director of CoreBlue he develops and leads the implementation of the company’s commercial strategy, oversees new business development and client relationships, and is also highly experienced in software development.He said that while the Covid-19 crisis has been disruptive it has highlighted the importance of tech to firms and said: “The first lockdown was disruptive, every company was trying to deal with its business continuity and not engaging with suppliers.“But after that first lockdown we had the best two months and were far busier than before, people are now prioritising tech development.”Follow @businessliveMore OnEducationTechnologySouth WestEconomySMEsCoronavirusTechallMost ReadMost RecentNorth WestCycling safety app Busby sees 870% increase in
