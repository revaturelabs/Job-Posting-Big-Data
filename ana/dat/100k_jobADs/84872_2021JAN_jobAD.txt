And that’s often an absurdly difficult task, given the tech industry’s notably low unemployment rate. But which jobs are hardest to fill?For technologists in those tech hubs, that information is useful because it gives them a little bit more leverage in any kind of salary or compensation discussion. Even if a company isn’t willing to pay you more money, your future manager and HR department might prove amenable to giving you more PTO, remote-work options, or a more flexible schedule.The good news is, the most common and hardest-to-fill jobs aren’t limited roles such as artificial intelligence (A.I.) researcher. When we analyzed New York, San Francisco, Boston, Seattle, and Austin, we found that the hardest-to-fill job was software developer/engineer, followed by IT project manager, with computer support specialist coming in third. Lots of folks have those jobs, and their skills are needed.Sign Up TodayMembership has its benefits.

To assess “hard to fill,” Burning Glass relies on four metrics: time to fill a position, number of job postings, salary, and “location quotient,” which is a measure of “concentrated” demand for a role within a particular geography.)Here’s the full list of the top 15 roles:The roles on this list should come as no surprise. Although companies are quick to tout their interest in machine learning and other cutting-edge technologies, they always need technologists who can maintain legacy infrastructure and apps while creating products that consumers need right now. That’s why developers, engineers, and architects top this list, along with multimedia designers and webmasters.While both the largest tech hubs and many up-and-coming tech cities have attracted a lot of negative attention over their high cost of living, a recent study from Indeed suggests that such fears about urban costs might actually prove overblown. “Even after adjusting for those costs, tech salaries are still 5 [percent] higher in the largest metros than in the smallest ones,” Indeed reported. “And tech salaries in metros between 250,000 and 500,000 people are higher yet—and nearly the same across mid-size, large, and very large metros.”Of course, things might be a little different in San Francisco, one of the cities used in our analysis, given its much-publicized issues around housing costs and livability. In any case, check out Indeed’s salaries chart, which mixes “big” tech hubs such as Boston with rising ones such as Raleigh, NC.Take the data from Burning Glass and Indeed together, and it’s clear that tech hubs are still hungry for technologists, and often paying out salaries that make those cities livable. But that doesn’t mean just anyone with a modicum of programming knowledge can sweep through and expect to land a job at a major tech firm (with a handsome salary to boot). If you want to stand out, specialization (and a record of skill) is key, especially in areas such as cybersecurity.RelatedTech Salaries in Big Cities: Better Than You Assumed?Remote Workers Enjoy Higher Salaries.

Why are these jobs hard to fill? Skilled, educated, citizens are applying for them, and often I see the same position re-posted multiple times by the same company. Something is definitely rotten and hiring citizens should be the price of doing business in this country. Vote only for candidates that support strong labor unions!November 9, 2019 at 9:28 amReply	Kangni D Amouzougan March 6, 2020This is just trueMarch 6, 2020 at 3:41 pmReply	PD November 10, 2019So very true. I believe what they deliberately do not mention is that they are ONLY looking for young candidates with lower pay. In my experience, I am asked if I have H1B, EAD etc. The moment I say that I am a US Citizen, that recruiter never calls me back.November 10, 2019 at 7:45 pmReply	Shannon November 11, 2019I keep getting annoying emails and calls from Indian companies and “hiring managers” with thick Indian accents requesting my resume for positions my actual job title and skillset that clearly show I’m not a match.They’re just using American names to perpetuate the lie that they “can’t find qualified US citizens” for the work. Well if they bothered to read my job title they would know that but foreigners are allowed to commit all kinds of fraudulent schemes against US citizen taxpayers. I even work with fraudulent foreigners and they watch tv instead of working. But they aren’t fired and get raises instead. Yet when US citizens leave the job because incompetent foreigners are promoted they whine about not getting people to do the job for minimum wage when its a 52K/yr job. Well of course not. Americans can’t even find affordable rent working three jobs let alone afford the freakshow known as college in this country.November 11, 2019 at 10:19 amReply	Click here to cancel reply.Name (required)	Email (will not be published) (required)	Comment	Related JobsSearch jobs in these related categories...Software EngineerIT Project ManagerComputer Support SpecialistSalary PredictorEstimated base salary using job title, location, and skills.More About Dice Salary PredictionsWhere does this estimate come from?Dice predicts salary ranges based on the job title, location, and skills listed in individual job descriptions.
