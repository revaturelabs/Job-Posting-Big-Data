While not all companies provide their remote workers with health care, retirement saving accounts, and other benefits, there are many that do. Here’s a list of nearly 70 companies with work at home jobs that often offer benefits. These jobs vary from customer service, technical support, sales, claims, recruiting and more.NOTE: Like all employers, these companies are looking for people to fill specific jobs. In other words, you can’t just sign up and start working. You’ll need to have skills and experience the company needs. Also:Not all jobs listed on the companies’ sites may be done from home. You may need to search the site’s job openings for those that allow for working at home.Not all jobs listed on the company’s site may provide benefits. For example, part-time employment (less than 30 or 35 hours a week) may not include benefits.These companies may or may not have work-at-home options with benefits available at this time. Check back with the sites regularly to see if new job openings are posted.They may require you to pay for the background check before hiring you.While every effort is made to keep links up-to-date, sometimes companies move their career information and job listings around. If you click a link that doesn’t work, go to the home page of the company site, and search for a option that says, “Jobs” or “Careers” or “Work with Us.”Companies that Offer Work At Home Jobs with
