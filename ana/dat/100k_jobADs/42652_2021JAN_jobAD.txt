When we leave or retire from it, it can be an incredibly difficult time (no matter how much we look forward to it!) It makes sense then that these memories and achievements should be documented...should be celebrated.​Whether you are a CEO, head teacher or bus driver, albums filled with your life's achievements and messages and stories from friends, colleagues and co-workers can be a fabulous way to look back on your working life.Albums can be filled with photos of your achievements, work events and celebrations, and messages from those whose lives you have guided, changed and inspired.What can I include?Work photos and memorabiliaLeaving cards and well wishesMemories and stories from friends and colleaguesPublished material that highlights their achievementsSir Al Aynsley Green retiresA digitally designed retirement album for England's first Children's CommissionerHandcrafted retirement albumA handcrafted scrapbook album for a retiring head teacher.Digital retirement scrapbookDigital scrapbooking album for a retiring decorating consultant at DuluxShow More\"It is really, truly beautiful.
