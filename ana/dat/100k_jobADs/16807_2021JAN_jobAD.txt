The basics of nursing safety can be summarized in 10 points, and nurses in Pennsylvania should take note of them. First, a lot depends on good self-care, including a healthy diet and plenty of exercise. Second, nurses should get plenty of sleep. By taking these two steps, nurses boost their immune system and are less liable to make mistakes on the job.Third, nurses should wash their hands often to prevent illness. Fourth, they should be vaccinated for influenza, which can be so easily transmitted to patients and colleagues through coughing and sneezing. Next, they will want to be current on other vaccinations like the measles, mumps and rubella series and the tetanus and diphtheria vaccine.When in the presence of patients with a possibly communicable disease, nurses should wear the right personal protective equipment like a mask, gloves, a gown and eye protection. When lifting patients, nurses should request help and, in turn, give it when they see colleagues in similar situations. Eighth, nurses should use lift and transfer devices when necessary.There are also needlestick- and sharps-related injuries to prevent, and nurses do this by safely handling these implements. Finally, nurses must practice good body mechanics to prevent ergonomic injuries.Under workers’ compensation law, nurses who are injured while on the job can be entitled to benefits. These benefits provide wage replacement and cover all medical expenses as well as any disability leave. They are not guaranteed, though, as employers have the ability to deny them. Before filing their claim, then, victims may want a lawyer to assess their case and provide both advice and guidance. If benefits are denied, the lawyer may help with filing an appeal.FacebookTwitterLinkedInCategoriesChild Support (10)Divorce (9)Employment Law (3)Family Law (10)Firm News (16)Litigation (1)None (1)Philadelphia Family Law And Workers' Compensation Law Blog (1)Philadelphia Workers' Compensation Law Blog (13)Probate & Estate Planning (13)Real Estate (5)Wills (5)Workers' Compensation (22)Workplace Accidents (9)Workplace Illnesses (12)Workplace Injuries (12)Workplace Safety (12)ArchivesJanuary 2021 (5)December 2020 (1)November 2020 (3)October 2020 (2)September 2020 (2)August 2020 (3)July 2020 (8)June 2020 (4)May 2020 (2)April 2020 (1)March 2020 (3)December 2019 (1)April 2019 (1)March 2019 (7)February 2019 (5)January 2019 (6)December 2018 (5)November 2018 (6)October 2018 (3)September 2018 (4)August 2018 (3)July 2018 (6)June 2018 (8)May 2018 (4)April 2018 (4)March 2018 (6)February 2018 (8)January 2018 (4)December 2017 (6)November 2017 (5)October 2017 (4)September 2017 (5)August 2017 (6)July 2017 (5)June 2017 (6)May 2017 (5)April 2017 (5)March 2017 (6)February 2017 (5)January 2017 (5)December 2016 (6)November 2016 (5)October 2016 (5)September 2016 (6)August 2016 (5)July 2016 (6)June 2016 (4)May 2016 (7)April 2016 (6)March 2016 (7)February 2016 (6)January 2016 (9)December 2015 (7)November 2015 (6)October 2015 (7)September 2015 (8)August 2015 (7)July 2015 (6)June 2015 (6)May 2015 (7)April 2015 (6)March 2015 (3)Recent PostsCan workers’ comp be denied if boss said I broke a work rule?Healthcare workers face the risk of illness and injuryWhat should you put in a living will?Can you collect workers’ compensation if you get sick?Are volunteer first responders eligible for workers’ compensation?Subscribe To This Blog's FeedContact The FirmEMAIL US FOR A RESPONSEPottstown Office800 East High StreetP.O.
