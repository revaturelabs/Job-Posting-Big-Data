The public sector shrank by 71,500 jobs.\"Not exactly what the doctor ordered, but not bad,\" BMO Capital Markets deputy chief economist Doug Porter wrote in a morning commentary.\"The headline jobs tally was a touch light, but the details of the report are unambiguously healthier — the strong gain in full-time jobs, the pop in private sector employment, and the fact that the overall number was skewed lower by yet another July drop in education employment.\"The construction, transportation and warehousing, and retail and wholesale sectors led the gains. There were 31,000 more construction jobs, 28,000 more transportation and warehousing jobs and 28,000 more retail and wholesale jobs in June. Even manufacturing posted a gain.On the flip side, there were fewer jobs in health-care and social assistance, while the number of public administration and management jobs was also down.Natural resources also had an off month and there were fewer jobs in agriculture.\"Just looking at the industry breakdown would suggest the cyclical components of the economy are on fire, while the public sector is pulling back — which hardly jibes with the anecdotal evidence, or any other evidence for that matter,\" Porter wrote.Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador posted job gains in July, while Ontario saw losses.Employment was down 22,400 jobs in Ontario following a slight increase in June. Despite the drop, employment growth over the last year stands at 1.6 per cent, which is similar to the national growth rate.The rest of the provinces were largely unchanged. Quebec's jobless rate fell, mostly because of fewer people entering the workforce.With files from The Canadian PressCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsReport Typo or ErrorRelated StoriesINTERACTIVE: Unemployment in CanadaCHART: Where the jobs areAvoid snap investment decisions amid market turmoil: expertFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersConnect with CBCFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBCP.O.
