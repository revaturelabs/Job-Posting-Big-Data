We swam and we crawled, we stood up and hunted, we fought and strived, we grew and developed, we raised thoughts and memories and fantasies, we became knowledgeable and sophisticated, we became self-sufficient, self-centered and self-obsessed, we became destructive and unhappy.We have managed to erase entire species destroying their natural habitat that largely impacted climate change and the global environment equilibrium.Our impact in the destruction of worlds’ forests is immeasurable and extensive. Many activities contribute to this loss including pollution, oil extraction and fires, but also road construction, agriculture, cattle ranching, and most extreme hunting and poaching. Animals are overhunted and sold on wild markets; they are killed for supposed medical purposes and brutally exploited by the clothing industry.Climate crisis has also contributed to massive shrinkage of animals’ territory, especially of ones that can only survive in extreme arctic conditions and rainforests. As a consequence, starving polar bears are walking ghosts on the beaches and towns faraway from their territory.Today during pandemic, animals are coming back in peace on the empty streets of now looking ghost towns.Tigers are at the kiosks, dolphins in the channels, eagles on the rooftops, hyenas at the cafes. They are out there and we have to make space, we have to share the planet as this home belongs to all of us. The return of wild animals in the cities is both surreal and expected. Facing this almost mythical adversity, we have a chance to learn and move to the next chapter. All we have to do is to be conscious, aware and observe. The answers are right here in front of us.Why Flamingos do not fly away from the zoo?The foxes, mink, raccoon dogs and rabbits raised on fur farms, remain confined in small wire cages for their entire lives. Unable to express their basic natural behaviours such as digging, roaming large territories, swimming and diving, these naturally active and curious animals have been shown to display the stereotypical behaviour of mental distress such as repeated pacing and circling inside their cages. When their pelts are at their prime before they are one year old, the animals are gassed, electrocuted, beaten or have their necks broken.

Being an amateur photographer I have succeeded to sell my photos on Getty Images. I’m a passionate climate change activist and I wanted to translate this dedication into a conceptual exhibition under the quote “Humans are animals – Animals are human”. These photographies are taking part of the exhibition.Submit for Best PictureAboutAbout UsStatisticsNewsletterContact UsSocialInstagram @artjobsFacebook @artjobscomFacebook GroupOur ServicesWe Post Jobs For YouPromotional ServicesInstagram PromoNewsletter PromoGrow Your BusinessPersonalReceive job notificationsPost Job WantedSubmitSubmit for Artist Of The MonthSubmit for SpotlightSubmit for \"Female\"Submit for \"Mental\"Submit for Best PictureSubmit for Art of DesignSubmit for Art of FashionPublish Your InterviewSubmit for ShowcaseDatabaseCommercial Artist DatabasePerformer / Talent DatabaseCreative Business DatabasePeople DirectoryPostPost NewsPost Creative JobsPost Arts Open CallsPost Casting CallsPost LearningPost Space for RentPost EventStartupStartup CommunityJoin our mailing listArtJobs Newsletter ( All )US NewsletterUK NewsletterEurope NewsletterBusiness & OrganisationRecruitment Agency / HeadhuntingLearning / EducationAuditions & Casting CallsActingCreative DirectionCraftsEventsDance & PerformanceFilmFashion & ArtistFine ArtGallery & MuseumGraphic Design / BrandingInterior Design / ArchitectureInterdisciplinaryLiterature & CultureModelingMusicPhotographyResidencyTV & VideoTheaterVisual ArtsE-mail *Do not show this againDesign Jobs | Art WeekArt Jobs 2020 All rights reserved | Terms | Contact Us"
