In this volume in IVP's Ancient Christian Texts series, Thomas Scheck provides a new translation of Julian's commentaries on the biblical books of Job and those of three Minor Prophets: Hosea, Joel, and Amos. Here, readers will gain insight into how early Christians read texts such as God's speech to Job, Hosea's symbolic representation of God's unending love for a faithless Israel, Joel's anticipation of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and Amos's call for social justice.While Julian was a well-known leader among the Pelagians, whose theology was famously opposed by Augustine of Hippo and ultimately determined to be outside the bounds of the church's orthodoxy, the Pelagian movement was a significant element within the early church. And although Julian's Pelagianism does not fundamentally affect the commentaries presented in this volume, Christians can gain insight into the truths of Scripture by reading the text alongside others, even when—or perhaps especially when—we might disagree with other aspects of their beliefs.CONTENTSGeneral IntroductionVolume Editor’s IntroductionExposition of the Book of JobTractates on the Prophets Hosea, Joel, and AmosCommentary on the Prophet HoseaCommentary on the Prophet JoelCommentary on the Prophet AmosBibliographyGeneral IndexScripture IndexMoreREQUEST AN EXAM COPYYou May Also LikeYou May Also LikeCommentaries on the Twelve ProphetsJobCommentaries on the Twelve ProphetsExploring the Old TestamentDictionary of the Old Testament: ProphetsABOUT Thomas P.
