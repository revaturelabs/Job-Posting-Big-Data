Bars, traditionally known for their experience and ambience, have been hard hit because they are forced to close, for the greater public good.Bars are a part of our cosmopolitan culture, a way of life, a way we connect. Fortunately, many bars have responded and found ways to bottle their cocktails for takeaway. A small group of us—like-minded individuals who appreciate a good drink—wanted to support the bars we know and love. Thus, we came up with Project #WheelsOnTheBars—a community where bars can continue their craft while folks can show their support.Order a drink to unwind from WFH during this circuit breaker month, or a few more to enjoy with your loved ones, delivered to you on the same day. With your support, these bars will be able to survive and sustain their business operations. 100% of the sale proceeds will go to the bars.Buy a drink, save a bar.Payment methodsAmerican ExpressMastercardVisaDeliver For UsSearchTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyFacebookInstagramPayment methodsAmerican ExpressMastercardVisa© 2021, Wheels on the BarsUse left/right arrows to navigate the slideshow or swipe left/right if using a mobile deviceChoosing a selection results in a full page refresh.Press the space key then arrow keys to make a selection."
