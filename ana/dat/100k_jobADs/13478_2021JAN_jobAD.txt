He is never going to be without a job.\"Related ArticlesSuper sub di Resta impresses for WilliamsHungary F1 Test: The line-up so farIndeed, after team co-founder Sir Frank Williams described H?lkenberg as a future F1 World Champion in-the-making [see separate story - click here] - having already prevailed in practically all of the significant junior formulae - Michael has now been similarly quick to pour praise upon the team's impressive young charge in his assessment of Williams' Brazilian weekend.\"His performance was exceptional,\" mused the softly-spoken Australian of qualifying at Interlagos. \"It was great to see him do everything right on the slick tyre at the correct time. He didn't put a foot wrong and warmed the tyres up perfectly to generate the grip he needed for the lap time.\"It would be reasonable to say that we expected more in the race. It was clear to us that we didn't have the pace to match the top three teams, but we expected to be fighting for sixth and seventh positions. Unfortunately, we just weren't quick enough in the first stint with Nico. However, he did a good job to move us up in the constructors' table to sixth.Related ArticlesHungarian Grand Prix - GridDi Resta felt 'back at home' driving F1 car again\"We also had the pit-stop problem with Rubens [Barrichello - team-mate] that put him out of contention. We had a problem with the wheel nut engagement; we are still looking into the problem and although we don't have a definitive answer yet, we will ensure it is rectified for this weekend. After that, Rubens went for it as we expected him to do, but unfortunately it didn't quite pay off [due to his late-race collision with Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jaime Alguersuari that left the Brazilian with a puncture].\"We remain pretty confident [for Abu Dhabi] and we are sure the car performance will be good. Our target is to maintain sixth position in the constructors' championship.\"<PreviousButton attack an 'embarrassment' for Brazil, says Barrichello>NextFerrari: We knew it would be tough to clinch drivers' crown in BrazilClick Here for Comments >Get F1 news in your inbox!Leave this field blankCommentsLoading Comments...Follow CrashLatest ArticlesF1Carlos Sainz makes Ferrari F1 debut at Fiorano testMotoGPNo Honda call, but Dovizioso would be ready for Qatar4MotoGPLCR is latest team to confirm MotoGP place for 2022-2026F1Giuliano Alesi rolls back the years to emulate father Jean in Ferrari testMotoGPJerez set to host two official MotoE pre-season tests5More Related ArticlesF1'Scared, nervous, anxious' di Resta impresses on F1 returnF1Massa sad to miss Hungary, focused on Spa comebackF1Vettel leads all-Ferrari front-row in Hungary F1 qualifying2F1Hungarian Grand Prix - Qualifying results5F1Paul di Resta to make shock F1 return at Hungarian GP6Latest VideosF1VIDEO: Who were the top 10 drivers of the 2020 F1 season?
