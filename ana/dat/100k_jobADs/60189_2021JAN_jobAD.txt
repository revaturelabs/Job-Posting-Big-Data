Terry Douglas, Alliant President, was named the 2016 Tennessee Small Business Person of the Year. Terry will join other award winners in Washington, D.C. during National Small Business Week, May 1 – 7. “While it is an honor to be recognized, this award is a reflection on the outstanding people who make up, and contribute to, Alliant, and our clients who give us the opportunity to do what we do,” said Douglas. “Without either one of those two ingredients, recipients of this award are no more or less distinguishable than the next person.” Alliant Corporation provides consulting and professional services in environmental management, occupational safety and health and project control for governmental and private organizations across the U.S. Alliant Corporation also offers Job Hazard Analytics®, a web-based application specifically created to ensure that job hazard analysis accurately and consistently delivers maximum worker protection, minimizes risk exposure for individuals and corporations, and increases work quality and productivity.Online Orders Coming SoonIn the meantime, contact us at (866) 907-8909 or jha@alliantcorp.com.ContactTo contact the JHA Technical Expert and Sales Representative call or email:866-907-8909 (toll free)jha@alliantcorp.comSocial MediaNewsJob Hazard Analytics® launches new design and user experience with release 4.0Terry Douglas Named 2016 Tennessee Small Business Person of the Year© Alliant Corporation.
