I investigated the issue by looking at the \"Transaction Detail by Account\" in Quickbooks and found that the report appears to be only picking up the debits and not the credits from the Qucikbooks database. How can I get the report to show the actual balance for each individual item? \\\\Edit 6/16/2014:The previous question was answered via live chat.
