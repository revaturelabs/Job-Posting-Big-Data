In this case, please go ahead and order, and we’ll contact you later to confirm an exact delivery date.Important update on our delivery service for small itemsOur courier partners (DPD, Royal Mail and On the Dot) have all updated their delivery processes to take extra precautions due to Coronavirus (COVID-19). Please follow the below advice:1. Customers can use the DPD app to nominate a ‘safe place’ for their delivery to be left if they do not want close contact.For customers unable to use the DPD app, DPD is still able to offer a contact-free delivery and will take a picture of the property and capture a proof of delivery name instead of capturing a customer signature.2. Royal Mail is an unsigned service. Where Royal Mail needs to deliver a parcel, its teams will place the parcel at the customer’s door. Having knocked on the door, the delivery teams will step aside to a safe distance while the item is retrieved. If the delivery cannot take place, Royal Mail will take the parcel to the local depot for collection by the customer. The parcel will be held for 18 days as per normal process.3. For On the Dot, where a standard signature delivery is not possible, On the Dot will attempt to leave the parcel in a safe place and inform the customer of where the parcel has been placed.To see the courier partner for your delivery, please check your dispatch confirmation email (which will also include your tracking reference).Availability CheckerHow and when can you get hold of your selections?
