There is a huge gap in the pay and terms and conditions between Royal Mail and its competitors in the postal sector but if we want to attract people to the job in the future then we have to ensure there are decent jobs for them to do.“All postal workers, whichever company they work for, should be paid a decent wage with good terms and conditions. We are extremely proud of our ground-breaking deal with Royal Mail and competitors to the company should see the benefit in rewarding staff properly instead of overseeing a race to the bottom for employment standards in the postal industry.”Posted By: Brian Sheehan.Post navigation← Akron woman’s ashes recovered after getting lost in the mailVideo: Most Packages Safe Following Ohio Post Office Fire →Recent PostsUSPS closes a Wallingford CT post office due to lack of staffingUSPS steps up security during second stimulus distributionOutrage over U.S. flag flown upside down, at half staff at Hawaii POPostal Service Implements New Organizational Structure For Employees Working in Dock AreasSheila B.
