Stopping smoking, especially on your own, is no easy feat and this is where the story of VPZ begins.One thing that really hit home for the owners when they were making the switch to vaping was the poor customer experience, lack of availability and lack of choice when maintaining their own supply of liquids and coils. Fuelled with the desire to help more people kick the habit by making the switch to vaping and armed with the knowledge that in 2012 there were approximately 12.4 million smokers in the UK, they decided to open their first ever VPZ store in Leith, Edinburgh.7 Years later VPZ now have over 120 Stores across the UK, with more store openings on the way we are forever growing and would love you to be part of a wonderful and ever expanding team.vpz.co.ukCoworkers 250+Founded in 2012Career siteStartDepartmentsLocationsJobsSee what our staff have to sayDepartmentsHR DepartmentIT DepartmentMarketing DepartmentRetailFinanceWarehouseAll DepartmentsUsersCandidate loginEmployee loginData & privacyScroll to topAlready working at VPZ?Let’s recruit together and find your next colleague.email@vpz.co.ukLog inCareer site by Teamtailor"
