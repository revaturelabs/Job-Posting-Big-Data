Some clients are willing to disclose their disability to prospective employers and want their employment consultant involved in all aspects of work. Other clients prefer to keep their disability confidential and look to their employment consultant to provide “behind the scenes” support, but not to have direct contact with employers.We’ll respect your preferences and provide the support you are comfortable with.Employment Assistance FundWorkskills can help people with disability and their employers to access FREE work related services and supports Employment Assistance Fund.
