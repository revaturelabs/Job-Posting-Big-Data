"With coaching job waiting, Ozarks man battles back from strokeYet, there he was in a hospital bed in late June 2016, partially paralyzed from a stroke and facing the daunting task of relearning how to speak clearly, walk independently and regain use of his dominant right hand.It was in the despair of that low point that Gallant told his close friend, Dan Evans, he could not become the head coach of the new girls golf program at Springfield Catholic High School.Once a top-notch golfer — boasting a handicap of just one or two over par — Gallant could no longer grip a spoon. Half of his face drooped. He couldn't walk the course. Driving a car was out of the question.Evans, the assistant athletic director, relayed the resignation to his boss, athletic director Sam Wutke, who urged Gallant not to make a rash decision. After all, the season didn't start for another six weeks.\"Frank's initial response to Dan was 'Tell Sam I'm out,'\" recalled Wutke, who coaches the football team. \"I was like, 'Let's just wait.'\"Neither Evans nor Wutke was ready to give up on Gallant. They'd recently watched him bounce back after a brutal regimen of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery to treat and overcome stage IV throat cancer.The cancer left him weakened, scarred and 65 pounds lighter. In the months leading up to the stroke, he'd finally started to feel like himself again.The stroke was a major setback. To recover, Gallant knew he'd have to summon the mental toughness he learned as a standout student-athlete at College of the Ozarks and preached to teens as a longtime teacher and coach in Ozark.He was assigned speech, physical and occupational therapy. He listened to doctors. He wanted to regain what he'd lost and coach again.\"You have to have a goal, something to work for,\" he said. \"I was determined I was going to get there.\"Gallant, who's never married, leaned on his large extended family, which has deep roots in Christian County. He also received regular visits from a tight circle of friends, including Evans.\"They helped by giving me a hard time. That's what they've always done. They didn't let up,\" he said. \"I'm the type, I'd rather be picked on than anything else.\"The last thing he wanted was pity.\"You can't feel sorry for yourself,\" said Gallant, now 58. \"If you let yourself get down, you regress.\"As the season neared, Gallant gained strength and more control of his right side. While not yet 100 percent, he agreed to go ahead and coach.But, there was a major hitch: Doctors had not yet cleared him to drive.Wutke lined up rides for Gallant to each golf practice and match. He said it was the least the school could do.\"He fought. At the beginning of the season, you could see him battle the effects of the stroke in his speech and his balance,\" Wutke said. \"He just hung in there.\"In mid-May 2016, there was a brief meeting at the high school with a handful of girls who wanted to play golf. Gallant had been introduced as the coach.He suffered the debilitating stroke June 29 and was nervous about seeing the girls again at the start of the season. He knew they'd notice a dramatic difference.A freshman at the time, Kayla Pfitzner, recognized that Gallant struggled to talk. He had a hard time keeping up on the course.\"It's really hard to come back from a stroke and to coach and walk with us,\" said Pfitzner, now a junior. \"He really stepped up. He didn't let it stop him.\"She added: \"It shows how much will he has.\"Pfitzner said her dad, David, often gave Gallant a ride to his home in Fremont Hills after practice, since they lived nearby. Others also pitched in.While still recovering, Gallant said it was a relief to concentrate on coaching. He spent a lot of time thinking about how to help each player improve.\"I was in my comfort zone,\" he said. \"When you're coaching, that is your focus. I really wanted quality practice every day.\"More:Springfield school nurse, 'heart and soul' of Pipkin Middle School, dies unexpectedlyPfitzner, 16, said the coach instinctively knew when to make players buckle down and when to joke around. After a particularly grueling practice, he'd treat the team to ice cream or Powerade.She said the players could tell how much it meant to Gallant to coach again.\"I'm a coach. I'm driven to excel for myself and for my teams,\" he said, looking back. \"It was a godsend; I had a place to go.\"Gallant, who gained mobility and strength throughout the year, stressed the fundamentals and urged the girls not to over-complicate the game, often saying: \"Keep it manageable.\"The fledgling team finished its inaugural season and improved. New golfers joined.\"Since our team has grown, he's gotten more fun and more competitive,\" said Pfitzner, whose younger sister Kyleigh has since joined the team. \"He has a really loving side, a coach who could instantly be your friend.\"This year, in mid-October, the team played their way to the Class I state championships and came in second place. The team set new scoring records this year.\"We got as close as you can without winning first,\" he said. \"We had a great year.\"At state, Kayla Pfitzner won first place and freshman Reagan Zibilski won second.Zibilski, who was new to Springfield Catholic High this year, said the coach helped her fit in.\"Coach, he's just amazing. He is very encouraging. He is really motivational,\" she said. \"He has a great sense of humor and makes practice really fun.\"Zibilski, 14, didn't immediately know about the health challenges Gallant faced. She said he rarely brought it up.More:In effort to help youth, Willard police chief develops Camp Character\"Every single practice, he gave it 100 percent. I never saw him slacking. Cancer wasn't going to get him down. A stroke wasn't going to get him down,\" she said. \"I learned he is a fighter.\"She joked that with Gallant as an example, it was hard to get discouraged or to complain about sore muscles or a cold.\"We had to put everything in perspective,\" she said.Gallant said tests this fall show no signs of cancer in his body, but his throat, ravaged by the treatment, has changed. He still isn't able to comfortably eat hamburgers or steaks and jokes he's learned to love shakes and \"anything with gravy.\"He doesn't know if his once-impressive golf swing will ever return. But, he's happy using his knowledge to teach the students.More:In memory of 'Mr. Nick,' fundraising for inclusive Springfield playground tops $84KLooking back, he said the coaching job helped him work harder to heal after the stroke.\"Coaching gave Frank the drive, determination and passion to work hard to continue his recovery,\" Evans said. \"Our school needed Frank to coach our team, and he needed our school.\"Wutke said Gallant is devoted to his team and they, in turn, work hard for him.\"They saw how much he cared about them, as people and as golfers,\" he said. \"We all also saw how, if you have a goal, you can overcome.\"Wutke said Gallant, who is on the mend, has plugged in at the high school. In addition to coaching golf, he is assistant coach for girls basketball and helps supervise the crowds at football games. He plans to coach golf again next season.\"I'm grateful to him and I hope he stays,\" he said. \"Frank can have that job for as long as he wants it.\"About Us Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2021 www.news-leader.com.
