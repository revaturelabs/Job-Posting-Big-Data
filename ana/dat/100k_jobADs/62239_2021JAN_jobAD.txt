We help countries to develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities and build resilience in order to sustain development results.Inclusive growth, better services, environmental sustainability, good governance, and security are fundamental to development progress. We offer our expertise in development thinking and practice, and our decades of experience at country level, to support countries to meet their development aspirations and achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).UNDP’s Bureau for Policy and Programme Support (BPPS) is responsible for developing all relevant policy and guidance to support the results of UNDP’s Strategic Plan. BPPS’s staff provides technical advice to Country Offices; advocates for UNDP corporate messages; represents UNDP at multi-stakeholder fora including public-private dialogues, government and civil society dialogues, South-South, SIDS-SIDS and Triangular cooperation initiatives; and engages in UN inter-agency coordination in specific thematic areas. BPPS assists UNDP and partners to achieve higher quality development results through an integrated approach that links results-based management and performance monitoring with more effective and new ways of working. BPPS supports UNDP and partners to be more innovative as well as knowledge and data driven through its programme support efforts.UNDP is committed to Small Island Developing States (SIDS), working to connect the UN global processes to regional and local development priorities and supporting and advocating for SIDS-specific development solutions. With a broad country presence, UNDP has a major organizational investment and a multi-sectoral programme portfolio in SIDS.UNDP was at the forefront of the Third International Conference of SIDS in Samoa in September 2014, with BPPS playing a key role in the preparations of the Conference and actively following up on actions identified in the outcome document, SAMOA Pathway. As a listed agency in the UN Implementation Matrix for the Pathway, UNDP is contributing to sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth with decent work, sustainable tourism, climate change, disaster risk reduction, sustainable energy and oceans work areas by supporting countries to integrate these priorities into development programmes, based on the trade-offs between resource availability and needs identified within each country aligned with member states’ priorities and requests.UNDP is committed to Small Island Developing States (SIDS), working to connect the UN global processes to regionally and locally owned development priorities for SIDS, and supporting and advocating for SIDS-specific development solutions. One of the outcomes in the UNDP Strategic Plan 2018-2021 is tailored to give special attention to “capacities developed across the whole of government to integrate the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and other international agreements (including the SAMOA Pathway) in development plans and budgets, and to analyze progress towards the SDGs, using innovative and data-driven solutions.” UNDP provides support to SIDS through policy and programme development and implementation that builds on international, national and local priorities. UNDP is committed to support SIDS through a global framework, consisting of three main pillars: Climate Action, Blue Economy and Digital Transformation.Through strategic partnerships and advocacy, UNDP aims to bridge gaps and create a network between SIDS and other key stakeholders. UNDP supports SIDS governments to build capacity — institutional, policy, technical — which enhancesregional support the implementation of international normative standards and commitments in their own countries.UNDP supports SIDS in partnership with other development actors, civil society, private sector, and governments, in order to achieve the SDGs and provide holistic development solutions. Furthermore, with its long in-country presence in many SIDS, policy and programmatic work, engagement, and advocacy, UNDP can be seen as a “partner of choice” to bring visibility, maintain momentum and influence action in order to ensure SIDS are not left behind in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.UNDP has a large portfolio on sustainable development, including a policy advisory and programmatic focus on Small Island Developing States.
