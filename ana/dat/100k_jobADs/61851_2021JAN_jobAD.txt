Simple natural everyday look nothing too hard maybe to shoot for 2 hours max. Will be more story telling shoot.You can use all the photos for your own portfolio/socials too.You can see my photography on my instagram @nilymasnapsAnd I have attached the mood for the first story.If you're interested in shooting with me get in touch.
