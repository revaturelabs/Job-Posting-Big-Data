ALC is part of the course! Once you graduate 17E school you automatically graduate ALCVote up(5)CommentVote down(0)Comment220WO1 (Join to see)Posted 2 y agoI had a really long message typed out before I saw your tags. I don't know what a \"Field Illumination Crewman\" is, but 29E (Electronic Warfare Specialist) was rebranded as 17E (Also Electronic Warfare Specialist) at the beginning of FY19. If you're asking about EW, then as far as I know, there is not an ALC; ALC is included in the Basic Course. When I graduated the course in 2014 there was a MILPER message that covered this. I will try and find my copy of it, and see if there's an updated copy.

If you are already 17E you should've gotten the same email, if not, send me your email and I'll forward it to you.Vote up(1)CommentVote down(0)SGT (Join to see)>1 yRgr...SSG smith sent it to me this monthUp(0)ReplyDown(0)SGT (Join to see)>1 yIn progress of re-classing atm but would like the info.

Thank in advance ssg SmithUp(0)ReplyDown(0)WO1 (Join to see)>1 yALCON,If anyone is still in the dark about this, search for ALARACT 126-2014. This explains that specialty MOS don't have resident ALC courses, that SSD 2 and completion of the basic MOS course counts as credit for ALC. Still searching on a link between this ALARACT and specific MOS.Up(1)ReplyDown(0)SGT (Join to see)>1 yWO1 (Join to see) then you SSG this was what I was looking for and I was able to link up with my BN EW NCO and got the remaining stuff I was looking for answered.
