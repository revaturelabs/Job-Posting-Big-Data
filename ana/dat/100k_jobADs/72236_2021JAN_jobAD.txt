Penalty amounts marked with an asterisk have been identified by Good Jobs First as duplicating other penalty amounts.Note: our penalty amounts include not only fines and monetary settlements but also costs such as supplementary environmental projects or consumer relief that companies are often compelled to undertake as part of settlements. If the settlement includes fines paid to state governments, those are included as well.Home |About Us |Contact Us |Site Map© 2020 Good Jobs FirstConnect with us on:"
