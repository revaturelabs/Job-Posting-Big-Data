While I’m not one of those people who constantly self-diagnoses via WebMD, I do try to use the Internet to inform my decision on whether an office visit is necessary (it usually isn’t). Most younger people are like me, they turn to the web first when they have a health issue. Patient Conversation Media is a company that aims to be found when people make those initial searches. They are based in Austin, TX, and they publish “doctor-reviewed health-related content online for consumers” and use that influx of traffic to connect “patients to [their] network of physicians and other health care providers.” Patient Conversation Media came it at #22 on the Inc. 5000 with 8,782% three-year growth to $9.8 million in annual revenue.Join the ConversationPatient Conversation Media is one of those companies that doesn’t say much about itself. Their home page states that they aim “to empower doctors and patients to reduce health care delivery costs by 5%,” but there isn’t much on how they plan to do that. They just offer details about their four brands: ,f=”http://patientconversation.com/rxwiki”>RxWiki, dailyRx, 1-800-Oncologist, and 1-800-Therapist (the last two obviously have a phone component too). The websites don’t look like much, but together they’re driving nearly $10 million in revenue–Patient Conversation Media must really be doing something right. If you’d like to figure out what that is, visit their Careers page (which isn’t even linked from their home page). Current openings include Technology Recruiter, Sales Representative, Health News Reporter, and Web Designer / Programmer. There are also a few positions showing up on Indeed that aren’t on their site, so I’m not sure what’s up with that.Links to Help You Begin Your ResearchPatientConversation.comJobs at Patient Conversation MediaDo you like to use the web to self-diagnose?Related CompaniesWe've identified Patient Conversation Media as having career opportunities in the following categories:all employersbloggingdesignhealth carehuman resourcesjournalismmedicinerecruitingsalesTexasweb developmentwritingJobs Near YouBid On Local Remodeling Jobs - Reach New Customers In Your AreaHomeAdvisor Ashburn, VA ViewDelivery Driver - No Experience NeededDoorDash Dulles, VA ViewHigh Demand For Quality Concrete & Mason Pros - Get New Clients In Your AreaHomeAdvisor Ashburn, VA ViewDelivery Driver - No Experience NeededDoorDash Germantown, MD ViewFood Delivery - Weekly PayUber Eats Leesburg, VA ViewLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
