Previous project|Next project ?1 of 101 of 10Hilton Austin Overhead WalkwayAustin, TexasAnchoring downtown Austin, the Convention Center and Hilton Austin Hotel straddle a busy street that handles a high volume of vehicular traffic, a MetroRail station, bike lanes, and pedestrians. The skybridge offers a safe and convenient pedestrian alternative to crossing this intersection between the two buildings. The installation was achieved through a creative multi-step process of assembling portions of the bridge off-site, shipping the pieces to the project location, then reassembling and raising them into place ?— 55 feet above street level via crane. Complementing the urban fabric and the characteristic Austin skyline, the bridge's open-air concept maintains a visual connection to the city. Green space and patios at either end of the bridge create a dynamic, outdoor space to elevate Austin’s Convention District.Related ContentDialogue issueDialogue 35: TRANSFORMING THE URBAN...As cities continue to grow, designers are stepping in...Design forecast2019Over half the world’s people now live in cities — a...BlogHouston's ByDesign Group...A group of young architects and designers at Gensler...BlogDefining the Future of Our...We are witnessing global disruption at an unprecedented...BlogNew Opportunities for...Our wholesale shift in live-work-play behaviors as a...OfficeAustin1011 South Congress Ave, Building I, Suite 200Austin TX 78704Phone: +1 512.867.8100ShareTwitterFacebookLinkedInEmailContactGensler Fact SheetSite MapNewsletterDiversityTop of page© 2020 Gensler, All Rights Reserved Privacy Statement & Cookie Policy Transparency StatementPlease enable JavaScript to experience the full functionality of www.jobs63.com一本之道高清无码视频_韩国三级电影_香港三级韩国三级日本三级"
