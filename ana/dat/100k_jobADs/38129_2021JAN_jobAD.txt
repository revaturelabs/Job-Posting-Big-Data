Haven’t watch eps 6 yet though… :dReplyAugust 16, 2015¬_¬;_;ReplyAugust 17, 2015pikopikaThank you!When you say “Maeda reference”, are you talking about the music video of Kanade?ReplyAugust 17, 2015FyurieYeah. :PReplyAugust 17, 2015GeassGxThis show and Gakkou Gurashi! are bad for my heartReplyAugust 17, 2015CezarOh, the edge. I don’t know what I was expecting.ReplyAugust 17, 2015slackzyGood Job Tokyo.I mean Good Job, Good Job! Media!ReplyAugust 17, 2015GrimroDAT reference, plus that bad-ass side of MP. Too much. Still curious about the new girl introduced in the last episode =(. Thanks a bunch guys!!! Good Job!ReplyAugust 17, 2015PlantzSoul = crushed. Thanks for the feels ;-;ReplyAugust 17, 2015givenspWell that sucks! She’s really dead! She was my favorite character, she literally made me lol.Is this going to be one of those really dark shows? With a lot of twisted stuff like torture & people dying?ReplyAugust 17, 2015Cezar>sister>deadYeah, no. This is Maeda.ReplyAugust 17, 2015NOT_Implying_AnyStrange… That secret recipe jar got refilled. ( ¬‿¬)ReplyAugust 17, 2015KobyAm I the only one who remembers that Idol can be possessed by the dead? I know they’ve really only shown it be done by her sis, but I’m pretty sure her power isn’t limited to only her sis. If imouto is really dead, well it’s not like she can’t still make an appearance and talk to MC.ReplyAugust 17, 2015FyurieIt’s definitely possible. Let’s see if Maeda’s going for that angle or not, though.ReplyAugust 21, 2015Gremoryoh damn i totally forgot that she can do that.ReplyAugust 22, 2015petoyusaNo, it’s not possible since channeling has to be one’s superpower. That’s why Yusa/Misa can do this; that’s why Imouto/Yuu cannot do this.ReplyAugust 22, 2015FyurieI think the implication was that Yusa could channel Ayumi, not Yuu.ReplyAugust 22, 2015petoyusaic. Now I wonder wheater Yusa’s superpower is bound to Misa or not.August 22, 2015Gremoryi’m think misa could do this since they were closely related and so that something about feeling another arua to connect.but then again it was yusa’s ablitiy and misa ability is just flamesReplyAugust 17, 2015givenspWhat’s Maeda?ReplyAugust 17, 2015Cheslocktell me you’re joking…ReplyAugust 17, 2015givenspno… Why?ReplyAugust 17, 2015givenspI did a google search & came up with these…-Maeda Toshimasa, daimyo, vassal of Oda Nobuhide-Marquis Toshinari Maeda, World War II general-John Maeda, graphic designer and computer scientist-*Mahiro Maeda, artist, writer and director of anime-Michiko Maeda, film and television actress-*Tatsuyuki Maeda, video game composer-*Toshio Maeda, a Japanese manga artist-Maeda Corporation, holding companyI don’t know if any of them are right though!?( * ) = ( Best Guesses )ReplyAugust 18, 2015KobyJun Maeda is the writer of Angel Beats! and Charlotte.
