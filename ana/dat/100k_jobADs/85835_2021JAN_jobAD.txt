Personal blog of Victor Dorneanu.Steve Jobs by Walter IsaacsongFrom time to time I like to read about great personalities and how their handling and decisions changed the world. I'm not an Apple fan and I do have something against Apple's closed platform approach. I also don't obsessively admire Mr. Jobs and its products, but this book gives you a very good impression how it feeled to work with and for Steve Jobs. Although this is the only book I've read about him, I think Mr. Jobs had a really huge impact on what we define nowadays a well designed product. I also admire his intention to combine arts and technology and give people the right tools to express their creativity. I highly recommend this book for those who want to learn more about how this whole PC thing started and why Microsoft and Xerox have missed the chance to revolutionize the world.Prev: Some words on CSRF and cookiesNext: Bye bye VODKA!Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.comments powered by DisqusPublished:2016-02-01 00:00category:blogTag:books4apple2Table of contentsSteve Jobs by Walter IsaacsonCommentsPowered by Pelican, theme built with Bootstrap3 by Ma Wenbao, icons by Font Awesome.© 2008 - 2016 Victor Dorneanu"
