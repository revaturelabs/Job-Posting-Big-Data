I haven't written much about it here, maybe because it's my real job and worlds colliding and all that.I teach Public Health. The class I teach is a great fit for me because it's a survey course, which means we cover hundreds of years and topics in one semester. As a result, the course content is (as my dad would say somewhat derisively) a mile wide and an inch deep.By now you know that I'm also a big dork who dearly loves things like Totoro and Korra and Marvel and Harry Potter and too many other geekish things to list here. But I love Public Health the most. Oh my gosh, you guys. I want to talk about drug resistant gonorrhea all the time. Did you know that many of the US-funded Ebola treatment centers in west Africa have never treated a single patient?? Social determinants of health are my jam, you guys.So I wrote this exam question and I was pretty excited about it. Because I love John Snow (the father of modern epidemiology) and I made my students watch this video about him. And I also love Game of Thrones (of course, I could only read three and a half of the books because it was too rapey and it was giving me bad dreams).I can't wait to see what the students say when they get this question today! Will they be pleased and giggle (fun for me) or will they be annoyed and eye-rolly (also kind of fun for me)? Why is this job so great?Not the father of modern epidemiology.But still bad ass.Photo from Wikipedia.(c) Mommyland Blogs 2013-2014Check us out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & Pinterest.
