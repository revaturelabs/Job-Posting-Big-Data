Should they still list the job on their resumes since they did get the job but were unable to work? Should they indicate that it was cancelled due to Covid-19?EDITAlso: What if a SM was in rehearsals and just about to go into tech when a show was cancelled due to Covid-19? Would they still not put that on their resume even if they were involved with the rehearsal process?« Last Edit: May 01, 2020, 11:10 am by ProfSM »LoggedloebtmcModeratorPosts: 1574Affiliations: AEA, SAG, AFTRA, SMACurrent Gig: Caroling, caroling now we go — and looking for my next gig!Experience: ProfessionalRe: Covid-19 cancelled job on resume?« Reply #1 on: Apr 15, 2020, 02:04 pm »Excellent question being asked by many people right now. One of the key points raised is whether or not a contract has been signed, or at least offered. Most of what I'm hearing is that it can be mentioned in a cover letter but not on the resume, since they didn't actually work there.LoggedBenTheStageManContributorPosts: 56Gender:Sometimes all you need in life is a little Blue.Affiliations: AEACurrent Gig: Olney Theatre Center, Olney MDExperience: ProfessionalRe: Covid-19 cancelled job on resume?« Reply #2 on: Apr 15, 2020, 03:17 pm »While I sometimes do list upcoming shows (notated as \"Upcoming\"), I do think it's disingenuous to list a cancelled project if you know it's been canceled.

You gained no experience from it.It is certainly something that can be talked in within the cover letter for a few months. Maybe a year, at most. More to do with how excited you were to be selected for the opportunity and disappointed that it did not eventuate due to COVID-19. Maybe a sentence or 2 at most.Every employer is expecting to see a gap in peoples resumes over this period - so having that gap in the resume is not an issue.LoggedPrintPages: [1]« previous next »SMNetwork.org »Onstage »Employment (Moderator: loebtmc) »Covid-19 cancelled job on resume?SMF 2.0.17 | SMF © 2019, Simple MachinesXHTMLRSSWAP2riotous"
