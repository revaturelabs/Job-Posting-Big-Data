At one stage I wanted that gig but I wear too many hats already and I think members in my platoon would kill me if I put in for anything else.The classroom part of it,11 days total, started June 2nd then we had to goto concerts at Darien and CMAC to do evaluations on people who were under the influence of substances that they weren't supposed to be. The classroom part of it was no joke but there were a few people who I did evaluations on that made it all worth it.sigpicÎœÎŸÎ›Î©Î Î›Î‘Î’Î•Trooper4985's official theme songCommentPostCancelOTVFD18Forum MemberJoin Date: Feb 2007Posts: 755ShareTweet#682809-15-2010, 11:14 AMGrayPatriot,We could use another around here.

From what I hear, I'm kind of glad I didn't go.CommentPostCancelGrayStateForum MemberJoin Date: Dec 2006Posts: 581ShareTweet#683109-17-2010, 06:59 AM.................................Last edited by GrayState; 01-25-2013, 09:50 PM.CommentPostCancelpdlynbrookForum MemberJoin Date: Mar 2008Posts: 29ShareTweet#683209-23-2010, 06:15 PMhttp://wnyt.com/article/stories/S1758958.shtml?cat=300Paterson's layoff threat becomes realityALBANY--The memo went out to New York State agency commissioners Thursday. It calls for a workforce reduction of 2000 employees. The letter states that layoffs are an option but the President of New York's Public Employees Federation (PEF) says layoffs before the first of the year are a violation of a signed compromise the union has with the Governor.\"We're gonna hold him to the letter of that agreement--he doesn't need to lay off people to save,\" says PEF President, Ken Brynien.The memo is somewhat vague; it reads that layoffs will be \"part\" of this workforce reduction. Brynien hopes that means the state will allow those who want to take an early retirement to do so.Jim Blake, a 30 year Department of Criminal Justice employee, claims he had hoped to take advantage of the early retirement incentive but the agency only offered it to two people.\"What really bothers me is he's (Governor Paterson) saying not enough people are taking the incentive his commissioners aren't offering it,\" complained Blake during an interview on Tuesday.According to PEF, it has 600 members ready, willing and able to retire. But if the reduction described in Thursday's memo does ultimately include layoffs, then PEF will retaliate it court.\"Because they couldn't get their act together they want to take it out on average working guys--we're not going to take that,\" adds Brynien.Before Thursday's memo was even distributed, another union, CSEA, filed an improper practice charge against Governor Paterson.CommentPostCancelOTVFD18Forum MemberJoin Date: Feb 2007Posts: 755ShareTweet#683309-24-2010, 03:24 AM4985,Did you take ARIDE before DRE school?

I'm trying to get into an ARIDE class now because I don't meet the required time on the job for DRE school. Thanks.I did not, nor did any other Trooper I was in the class with (5 out of 20 of us were from A,E and T). Rich Devlin was intersted in how many guys in the class has been through ARIDE because as a class, we had the highest test scores in the last 6 years according to him, and by a show of hands... about 1/3 of the class had been through ARIDE. The guys who had been through ARIDE and remembered what they had learned, cruised through the pre-school and the top academic guy (Ontario County SO) had been through ARIDE.Some of the instructors said that there had been talk about making ARIDE a pre-requisite to DRE so I would say, beg, plead and be as much of a company guy as you are willing to be, to get into ARIDE if you want to add another tool to your belt during every traffic stop you make.sigpicÎœÎŸÎ›Î©Î Î›Î‘Î’Î•Trooper4985's official theme songCommentPostCancelOTVFD18Forum MemberJoin Date: Feb 2007Posts: 755ShareTweet#683609-25-2010, 04:59 AMOriginally posted by Trooper4985 View PostI did not, nor did any other Trooper I was in the class with (5 out of 20 of us were from A,E and T).

However, I'm currently enrolled in a long term training right now which my agency has invested a lot of money into. We also had a DRE at one time but his cert expired so I'm not sure if they'll send another.CommentPostCancelSlowDownThereCherub of JusticeJoin Date: Sep 2005Posts: 4047ShareTweet#683709-30-2010, 04:12 AMOriginally posted by pdlynbrook View Posthttp://wnyt.com/article/stories/S1758958.shtml?cat=300\"What really bothers me is he's (Governor Paterson) saying not enough people are taking the incentive his commissioners aren't offering it,\" complained Blake during an interview on Tuesday.Go ahead and offer the incentive to sworn members.
