Here, I will discuss what more universities and funding agencies should be doing as stakeholders in training and employing researchers.

There are many options open to you; one obvious one is to apply for a postdoc position. You should think carefully about what you want to do and not just pursue this through inertia. I have supervised many engineering PhDs and some postdocs in my 32 years as an academic. As Head of University College London’s Doctoral School, I oversee the environment and policy for 6000 doctoral candidates and 3200 postdocs.

This is something I’ve learned over the past year, my first as a mentor. Mentoring undergrads became part of my job only recently – in the past, research came first. Most advisors value research outcomes over mentoring, and departments certainly place more value on publications. Before this past year, I was used to just a single undergrad working in my lab, and I thought of them as worker bees, not as future colleagues.

To implement all the proposals would require a US$2 billion increase to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH)’s budget, as well as subsequent budget raises to prevent future funding bottlenecks.

While some stay in the US, and others return to Europe after their postdocs, I’m almost certain that anyone who has followed this path will have encountered a few shocks along the way. Choosing the right fit for your postdoctoral training is just as important to choosing the right lab for your PhD. Based on my experiences, here is a list of the things that I think are worth checking in advance to avoid thinking “I wish I had known” too often.

But the right PhD training is crucial to establish a good foundation for what comes next – either a job in industry, a postdoc in academia, or something away from the bench. Choosing the right lab is important, and there are considerations beyond gaining specific technical skills that need to be mulled over before making a decision. If I were to start another PhD, this is what I would look for: … Read moreTags:academiaconferencesdevelopmentelena blanco-suarezindustryLabnetworkPhDpostdocsupervisiontechniquestrainingworkshopsArticle toolsadd a commentEmailShare/bookmarkFacebookTwitterDeliciousDiggGoogle+LinkedInRedditStumbleUpon02 Mar 2018 | 13:00 GMTA year in the life: from the lab bench to the writing deskPosted by Rebecca Wild | Categories: Academia, Blog, Career paths, Mobility, PostdocLeaving’s never easy.
