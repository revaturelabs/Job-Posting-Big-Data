Sit back and enjoy lots of creative projects with the theme of Gift Packaging.I love making gift packaging. I love to see the excitement in people's faces when they spend those first few minutes just admiring the packaging rather than the gift inside.Today I am sharing with you a project which I have created for an upcoming online class. We are using the lovely Whale of a Time suite and are creating this little backpack.The backpack is held closed by creating a little buckle on the front. The ribbon you see on the top can pull through to the back so it looks like a backpack, just a bit of fun. Here is the back view so you can see what I mean.I love to try and use up all the offcuts when I can, so the closure is made from the offcuts of card and DSP and the fish are cut from the offcuts of the DSP used on the front and back of the backpack.I loved creating this project and the Whale of a Time suite is so bright and cheerful.I hope you have enjoyed my project and I am now going to pass you on to Leonie who I am sure will have something beautiful to share with you.Happy Craftin'JoxA list of the other participants are shown below:-Dana Sullivan (USA)Stacey MarshAnnette Ball - CanadaRochelle Laird-SmithLisa Mackey (USA)Mo RootesMarita Dreissen (Germany)Jessica Brigden (USA)Mikaela TitheridgeSusan Simpson (UK)Wendy Lee (USA)Leonie Stuart (Australia)Jo Blackman (UK)Ange McKay (Canada)The contents of this blog are the sole property of Jo Blackman, Independent Stampin' Up!
