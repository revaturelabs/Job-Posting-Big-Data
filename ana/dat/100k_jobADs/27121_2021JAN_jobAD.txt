Louisville Home PaintingMost surfaces that are being painted for the first time or that are making a significant color change need to be primed before they can be painted. Primer helps the paint adhere better to the surface, so it will last longer. In some cases, primer can also help prevent discoloration of the paint, such as is the case when painting cedar; cedar sap can bleed through paint in a condition known as cedar bleed. Priming blocks this sap discoloration so the paint job stays looking fresh longer. If you are making a significant color change, from light to dark or dark to light, primer can help bridge the gap more easily, cutting down on the number of finished coats of paint.Staining a deck costs $540 to $1,000.
