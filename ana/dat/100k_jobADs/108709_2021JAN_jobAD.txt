Over the years we have worked very hard to keep Seattle’s electricity affordable, reliable, and environmentally sound. Today, City Light is a recognized national leader in energy efficiency and environmental stewardship.Customer Care & Energy Solutions (CCES), the longest continuously operating municipal energy conservation initiative in the country, is seeking an Energy Management Analyst (EMA) Supervisor for the Project Development team. This supervisor will lead a team of multi-disciplinary energy management professionals who promote and deliver the utility’s portfolio of demand-side management programs to its commercial, industrial, multifamily, and institutional customers. The portfolio has historically been predominantly comprised of energy efficiency programs, however it is evolving and expanding to include distributed energy resources, such as demand response, distributed generation, electric vehicles, as well as building electrification. CCES is responsible for acquiring/delivering all cost-effective energy efficiency (kWh) to the utility (a least-cost resource) in support of I-937 targets – preserving and extending the benefits of Seattle City Light’s low-cost, carbon-neutral resources. The Project Development team, comprised of 18 EMAs, is responsible for delivering roughly 60% of the division’s resource acquisition target and processes several hundred customer energy management projects annually.The Project Development team delivers programs and services that help our customer owners and community partners meet their evolving energy needs, while striving to be their most valued and trusted energy partner. The group works with business customers across all sectors to conduct program outreach, opportunity assessments, and project development activities. The team also works closely with owners, developers, building operators, property managers, tenants, and a network of contractors, distributors, architects, engineers, design consultants, and other service providers that enable this work. The team helps customers maximize the performance of their existing buildings (across capital, O&M, and behavioral improvements) and new construction projects (to exceed energy code requirements) and through equipment incentives at distributor channels. In addition, the team contributes heavily to program design & development with a focus on enhancing customer experience, implementing continuous process improvement, and minimizing evaluation risk.This position is one of two EMA Supervisors who report to the Project Development Section Manager.View the full job description and application requirements HERE.Director of Energy Programs, Energy Trust of OregonLocation: Portland, ORAbout UsEnergy Trust of Oregon is an independent nonprofit organization dedicated to energy efficiency and renewable energy development.
