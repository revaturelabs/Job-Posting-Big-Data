Inspiring!LikeLiked by 2 peopleReply	Tink the Belle January 9, 2017 / 5:30 amThank you. It is very gratifying‚ò∫LikeLiked by 1 personReply	Doctor Jonathan January 10, 2017 / 12:52 pmIn retrospect you should thank those two doctors. They provided you the impetus needed to take back control of your life. Their disconcerting manner made you more cognizant of your NEEDS allowing your conscious mind to re-direct your priorities and place YOURSELF FIRST! Sometimes situations that seem like a ‚Äúblack hole,‚Äù in reality provide clearer insight for pursuing better directions in life.Often traditional doctors focus on extending mortal existence. To many of them, this is how they define LIFE. They think in terms of QUANTITY rather than QUALITY. None of us know our length of stay on this planet, but ALL of us possess the skills (if we look within ourselves) to create a quality we truly desire. It sounds like these doctors helped you find this path of self direction. CONGRATULATIONS and enjoy the PROCESS and JOURNEY!LikeLiked by 2 peopleReply	Tink the Belle January 10, 2017 / 2:04 pmThank you! Indeed the process and journey was a defining moment in my life that led me to an oncologist who truly and passionately encouraged me to visualize the healing during my treatment . I‚Äôll be discussing that more in my next blog post, so stay tuned. üôÇLikeLiked by 1 personReply	Patty J February 25, 2017 / 8:13 pm‚ÄúFinally becoming number one.‚Äù Congratulations for making that shift. We‚Äôre plagued by messages to care for everyone else and in doing so, sacrifice ourselves. Blessings to you.
