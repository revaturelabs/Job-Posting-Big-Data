But being a homeowner means more than just an intimate evening in front of the fireplace or a relaxing weekend on the deck.You mightn’t know it at first, but it’s an ongoing physical, emotional and financial commitment. You’ll need to make regular repairs – or call in your local handyman to do so – to avoid more expensive replacement bills down the track.One of the most common DIY projects for homeowners is painting. Whether you simply want to cover a nail hole or paint an entire room, nothing enhances the look of a home more than paint.Painting, if done properly, can significantly boost the value of a home and add flair and style to your space. But if the work is not done well, then it is easy to view spatters, sloppy trim paint and roller marks – it is just as bad as leaving peeling or cracked paint on your walls.If you’re doing it yourself and not calling in a professional handyman or painter, here are some tips on how to prep your DIY paint jobs like a pro…Clear The RoomStart by removing or moving any hardware or fixtures that might get in your way as you work. Remove curtain rods, loosen up fixtures, switch plates and door hinges. Sure, it will take up some time, but it will be worth it because if you leave anything on your walls, these will create obstacles for your rollers or paint brush. You will probably waste even more time trying to paint around them and the results will not be professional.Cover The FloorThis one’s easy. Cover all of the surrounding floors with old sheets that you don’t mind getting paint on them. It’s much better than having to clean paint off your precious carpet.Scrape and SandYour painting surface needs to be as clear and clean as possible, so remember to scrape off old loose paint before you start. Then sand the walls with quality sandpaper.Clean the WallsOnce you have clear walls, clean them up with a dry cloth or damp sponge and liquid (or powdered) sugar soap. You mightn’t notice on a day-to-day basis, but dust, grease and grime build up on your walls and they will keep paint from bonding well with your walls – which can cause streaks.Cleaning the walls is also a great opportunity to check intimately for gouges, nail holes and any other imperfections which needs filling, sanding or attention before the painting starts. Basic repairs like this, particularly in older homes, can make a huge difference in the quality of your DIY paint job.Use Painter’s TapeTo prevent paint getting on skirting boards and any other areas that you want to be in the paint-free zone, it’s also a good idea to use painter’s tape to cover up the areas that old sheets cannot.Have Your Cleaning Tins ReadyThe last thing you need is to start painting and realise you forgot to prepare your tins of cleaning liquid for your brushes. For water based paints, prepare a tin of clear water and label it. For oil based paints, pour some turpentine into an old paint tin and label it.Apply PrimerOnce you are done with cleaning the walls and your minor fix-ups, apply primer to all sanded areas. If you have sanded a larger area, consider utilising a paint that has primer in it. This eradicates the need to apply pure primer as a distinct job.More Tips?For more detailed tips and advice, either talk to your local handyman or painter, or check the company website of the paint you are using.
