Start by kissing or licking of his lips or earlobe with slight pressure of the tongue heading down towards the neck and nipples whilst rubbing your fingertips slowly up and down his torso. Come back up when you’re near his member or just below his belly button, and head back down.Don't just kiss, lick, suck, rub do whatever you're comfortable with, depends on what he likes experiment a little. Make him wait!! He’ll be so hard and horny as hell for you!! Not only does this foreplay build sizzling tension, but in a new relationship, it gives you a chance to suss out his body and take a good look at what you’re working with!Wetter is BetterKeep a tube of lube nearby, a flavored lubricant such as Wet Stuff Salted Caramel will add juicy flavor for you and feel deliciously slick for him. It’s a bit like using a tasty sauce with ice-cream both are good by themselves, but it’s a lot more fun with something sweet or fruity.Getting a dry mouth is as bad as lock jaw!! The wetter, the slipperier, the hotter he gets and the better the sensation is for him. Apply a dollop of lubricant on your fingertips and smear it evenly all over the head, shaft or wherever you want it. Smear it thin so you get the most out of it, you don’t want to eat it all in one go! Have fun licking and sucking his sweet tasting cock. Treat it just like a lollipop, like it's delicious and you can't get enough.Tip: Keep a glass of water nearby too help keep the juices flowingPleasure SoundsOwn those moans, men find it intensely sexy to hear appreciative pleasure noises during oral sex that doesn’t mean you need to go overboard with porn movie like moans and groans. A simple placement of your lips against his penis and humming a blissed out ‘mmmmmm’ sends out travelling vibrations through his manhood.Already do this? Why not advance to another level, try adding a J2S oral vibrator it will change your partners oral sex experience.As adults we know it’s rude to talk with your mouthful, but given the situation add dirty talk. Hot, steamy, breathless words!!Eye ContactMen are visually stimulated and feel a deeper connection with you when eye contact is made. They like to watch when receiving blowjobs! It’s beneficial for you as well, you can see his facial expressions and determine what he does and doesn’t enjoy. If you feel a bit awkward, plant yourself on his lap and try the tease method again but this time make eye contact.Nothing makes a guy enjoy a blowjob more than when he see’s hunger for his penis.Leave a commentBack to Nauti ArticleLeftOlder PostNewer PostRightContact usDeliveriesRefunds and ReturnsTerms & ConditionsTwitter Facebook Youtube Instagram© 2021 Nauti NZ.
