In June 2017, Amazon opened a corporate office in Toronto and in November 2017, the company confirmed plans to open a second Vancouver office in 2020, bringing another 1,000 jobs to the city. Amazon said it expects to grow to 5,000 corporate employees in Vancouver in the coming years.“With this bold investment, Vancouver just locked in the silver medal in the race for Amazon HQ2,” said Sean Elbe, Sector Development Manager, Technology at Vancouver Economic Commission. “And while these tech investments are important to Vancouver, there is lots of potential for a broader, long-term collaboration between Amazon and the existing ecosystem of digital entertainment & interactive industries. Vancouver is the third largest production hub in North America, the world’s leading VFX/Animation cluster and home to a surging AR/VR hub.”Photo courtesy of Amazon.retailvancouverShare on:FacebookTwitterPinterestGoogle +LinkedinAmira ZubairiAmira Zubairi is a staff writer and content creator at BetaKit with a strong interest in Canadian startup, business, and legal tech news.
