The National Skills Fund supports the government’s ambition to get people retrained quickly and to help them avoid falling into poverty.Funding rates for adult skills and education need to be set at the same level as those for 16-19 year-olds if the programme is to be successful in reaching hundreds of thousands of people.Budgets for adult skills programmes were cut by 40% in the first half of the last decade and have been fixed in cash terms since then despite inflation. Together with the introduction of loans to replace grants in 2013-14 for a range of 19+ courses, this has significantly reduced the number of adults learning.The report reveals that even at the maximum class size, none of the practical courses vital to the nation’s recovery are viable at current funding rates. This is no surprise given how inflation has eroded the rates over 10 years and how many of the courses suitable have high costs for materials.AoC is calling for the Spending Review to make the following reforms to adult education:Increase the core funding rates for the Single Activity Matrix (SAM) to bring equity with the 16-19 funding rate;Implement the High Value Courses Premium as per the 16-19 methodology;AoC’s Chief Executive, David Hughes said:“Today’s findings show that thousands of adults who find themselves out of work and require retraining are at risk of being left behind. Adult education has been neglected in education policy for too long. The government’s Lifetime Skills Guarantee extending full funding for a first Level 3 qualification to adults over the age of 23 was a welcome step but our analysis shows that without a funding rate increase, those ambitions will not be achieved.“As the report shows, the courses needed to train key workers and productive sectors that will get the country moving again simply cost too much to deliver compared with current rates. A failure to act will leave businesses without skilled workers and people in long-term unemployment and poverty.”How to resolve AdBlock issue?

The focus is solution led thought leadership, sharing best practice, innovation and emerging strategy. These are often articles about the future of education and the future of work, they often then create future education news articles. We limit our main features to a maximum of 20 per week, as they are often about new concepts and new thought processes. Our main features are also exclusive articles responding to the latest education news, maybe an insight from an expert into a policy announcement or response to an education think tank report or a white paper.FE VoicesFE Voices was originally set up as a section on FE News to give a voice back to the sector. As we now have over 3,000 newsrooms and contributors, FE Voices are usually thought leadership articles, they don’t necessarily have to be exclusive, but usually are, they are slightly shorter than Main Features. FE Voices can include more mixed media with the Further Education News articles, such as embedded podcasts and videos. Our sector response articles asking for different comments and opinions to education policy announcements or responding to a report of white paper are usually held in the FE Voices section. If we have a live podcast in an evening or a radio show such as SkillsWorldLive radio show, the next morning we place the FE podcast recording in the FE Voices section.Sector NewsIn sector news we have a blend of content from Press Releases, education resources, reports, education research, white papers from a range of contributors.
