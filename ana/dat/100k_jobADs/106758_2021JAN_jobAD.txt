With all these changes, we hope for a more tech-led, path breaking achievements in critical ailments and hopefully a more positive future.Talking of workplaces, oganisations are bracing themselves for an influx of millennials and a bevy of technological transformations at the work environment, shaping- ‘the workplace in year 2020’.According to the 2020 workplace theory, over 36% of the workforce will consist of people born after the baby boomer generation. This means that the workforce dynamics will change dramatically, facing the collision of different generations working together. At the same time, diversity will seep into all aspects of workplace, making the workplace more inclusive. TimesJobs spoke to the industry experts on how these changes will evolve the workplaces. Here’s what they said:“One trend we have seen accelerating is that the corporates in India are embracing a diverse and inclusive workforce. I have seen this focus not only with MNCs but also well-known Indian brands are making a conscious effort to promote diversity. The government too has played its part by mandating listed companies to have at least one woman director on board. The passage of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill and companies that are market leaders are creating a safe and welcoming workplace for LGBT and differently-abled people”, says Sandeep Raghunath, Head-Human Resources, EarlySalary.Aditya Kohli, CHRO – Clix Capital quotes, ‘skill, re-skill and repeat!’ With the life of technical skills now under five years, we will see a big focus on learning on both hard skills as well as soft skills. There needs to be a lot more collaboration between the corporates and the educational institutions as companies will struggle to build the right talent on their own. Here are some key trends:Gig Economy- Gig Economy will become mainstream for many organisations. Today a number of companies are still trying to evaluate the extent of exposure to this workforce. In 2020, we will have a number of well-defined solutions / platforms that will enable organisations to connect this workforce to core businesses. Freelancers are increasingly appealing and affordable option for companies who are looking to maximize their output without bringing in new hires. Freelance marketplaces are helping to drive the shift towards the gig economy.Organisational restructuring- Significant emphasis on organisation models and structures. Organisations will see a significant growth in Agile Structures, these teams will be self sufficient with multiple different skills, clear direction, high independence and decision making. These will start to bite on the heels of the traditional hierarchy.Scarcity of talent pool- Talent scarcity will get even more severe. Organisations will put disproportionate effort in driving three broad areas: Creating a larger Purpose, employer brand to attract the right talent, exceptional experience and flexibility for their employees.Collaboration over the competition – With agile ways of working, organizations in addition to enabling individual productivity will also need to empower teams. Organizations are working to break down silos to create a culture of collaboration. Modern infrastructure and dynamic office spaces teamed with digital software tools are breaking the barrier to collaborate with teams remotely.Employee experience- There is an overall uptick in integrated well being. Focus is towards driving engagement and providing a sense of fulfilment at the workplace over satisfaction. Today’s employees want to be measured on their contribution and outcomes. They expect organizations to give them flexibility, freedom, achievement, and meaningful work.Cross-skilling and upskilling- With emerging technologies, automation and changing the technology landscape, upskilling and cross-skilling would be an important aspect across all sectors.Social purpose and volunteering – Most organizations are supporting sustainable initiatives creating social purposes via community service and employee volunteering programs. Younger workers, especially, want to work for companies that are making a positive difference.Power of data – Data is becoming the driving force and organizations are increasingly leveraging data-driven approach to enable business decisions and organizational efficiencies.Change in learning processes- The existing workforce needs ongoing training to learn new skills, improve existing ones and continue to grow over time. Neville Postwalla- AVP-Talent Management, Harbinger Group, says \"traditional classroom learning and content will get replaced with micro-learning and will be delivered via nudges. The way people learn will change. We will see more of Nudge Learning delivered in a personalized fashion to employees on their mobiles\".Personalisation- Learning is not a one-size-fits-all solution anymore. HR will provide personalised experiences for different sets of people (gender, age, role, location, etc). Personalisation will enter functions like policy making, orientation, health and wellness, learning and development, and many more.Health and well being of employees- Health and wellness will play an important role in employee engagement programs. We will see many initiatives being run during work hours to help employees on the wellness front.Enhanced cycle of performance management- Traditional midyear and annual appraisals will give way to continuous performance management.Shift in the roles of HR- The involvement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) will increase in traditional roles such as resume matching, employee help-desk, onboarding, etc. HR will move to a consultative role from an operational role.Change in analytics- The focus will move from prescriptive analytics to predictive analytics to deliver deep insights on people and engagement.Chatbots will be used in a wide variety of HR functions – like answering a candidate’s basic questions (recruitment), answering policy-related questions and HR transactions (HR help desk), get the pulse of employees (engagement), etc.Removal of conventional pulse checks- Traditional annual/midyear surveys, will be replaced by more event-based and continuous pulse checks. These will provide real-time insights to leaders on areas that need to be acted upon.Diversity- HR will see policy changes being done to cater to gender neutrality and diversity.Shorter workweeks- The business world is buzzing about Microsoft's successful four-day workweek experiment in its Japan office this summer. With the impressive productivity increases, we suspect more companies might adopt the same structure.A bigger focus on improving the overall office environment- 2020 will bring a greater emphasis on feeling comfortable, reserving resources and being more environmentally conscious overall within the workplace.Grading of corporate hierarchies- Since our workplaces are and will comprise more of millenials, as they have been more dynamic professionally. In the coming time, most employees will take on various roles and make several networks that provide numerous opportunities and possibilities for success which will eventually fade out the hierarchies.Babitha. P, Head- HR, Opus Consulting Solutions shares- The composition of the workforce is changing significantly. Gen Z is accounting for a significant size of the global workforce. Today’s workforce is a good mix of multiple generations coming together and poised to keep up with the economic changes, technology advancement, automation, and globalization.Add Comment()Comments ()Characters Remaining: 3000SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmailOR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATIONXSort By: NewestOldestDiscussedUp VotedDown VotedBe the first one to comment.We have sent you a verification email.
