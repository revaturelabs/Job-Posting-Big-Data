We are hearing from many IT, Software and technical people in the Houston area who are finding themselves suddenly out of work.While the people at Decide Consulting cannot come up with an anti-viral drug, we can help those displaced individuals find new homes.While the number of IT, Software and technical job openings has fallen off, it has not been eliminated. The need for good technical talent remains.Every day during this period, we will post the IT, Software and technical jobs advertised in the Houston area. We will list “Origin” companies first, Consulting Companies second and other recruiting agencies third. You will notice we attempt to classify each opportunity by skill (e.g. Development, DevOps, Infrastructure, Testing,etc) and experience level.This is our little contribution to help the community recover just a little bit quicker. We traditionally only make this available to our recruiting and sales staff. Right now it is more important to help.
