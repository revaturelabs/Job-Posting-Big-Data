Also, MBA in Finance opens the gates of various NBFC's and companies dealing in Securities, Share market, bullions, investment etc. If you are interested in Insurance sector, you could also join many of the big insurance companies like Bajaj Allianz, ICICI Lombard, Future Generali etc by keeping a track of the openings available on their official websites.17-03-2012, 12:02 AMUnregisteredRe: Jobs other than marketing and sales after BSc and MBA in Finance?B.Sc.(BIOLOGY) WITH MBA IN FINANCE(major)&MARKETING(minor) SUB.
