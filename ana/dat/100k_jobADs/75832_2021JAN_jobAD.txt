(Image source: Ezanime - concept)An advert on a Japanese website has stated that the PlayStation 5 is scheduled for release in October 2020. The job listing is for a role within SIE’s materials department and would see the successful applicant undoubtedly working with the PS5. However, Sony has stated that the published launch date is a mistake.Daniel R Deakin, 05/12/2020Fail Console Gaming BusinessReviews , News , CPU , GPU , Articles , Columns , Other\"or\" search relation.5G , Accessory , Alder Lake , AMD , Android , Apple , ARM , Audio , Business , Camera , Cannon Lake , Cezanne (Zen 3) , Charts , Chinese Tech , Chromebook , Coffee Lake , Comet Lake , Console , Convertible / 2-in-1 , Cryptocurrency , Cyberlaw , Deal , Desktop , Exclusive , Fail , Foldable , Gadget , Galaxy Note , Galaxy S , Gamecheck , Gaming , Geforce , Google Pixel , GPU , How To , Ice Lake , Intel Evo / Project Athena , Internet of Things (IoT) , iOS , iPad Pro , iPhone , Jasper Lake , Kaby Lake , Lakefield , Laptop , Launch , Linux / Unix , Lucienne (Zen 2) , MacBook , Mini PC , Monitor , MSI , OnePlus , Opinion , Phablet , Renoir , Review Snippet , Rocket Lake , Rumor , Ryzen (Zen) , Security , Smart Home , Smartphone , Smartwatch , Software , Storage , Tablet , ThinkPad , Thunderbolt , Tiger Lake , Touchscreen , Ultrabook , Virtual Reality (VR) / Augmented Reality (AR) , Wearable , Whiskey Lake , Windows , Workstation , XPS , Zen 3 (Vermeer)TickerChristmas would have been coming earlier this year if a recent advert on a Japanese job site had been accurate. The job, which involves purchasing parts and materials, was posted on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment, and when machine translated it revealed that the PlayStation 5 is “scheduled to be released in October 2020”. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely gamers will be getting their hands on the PS5 sooner than expected as Sony has stated that it was a mistake.The job listing, which comes from a site called Next.Rikunabi and was shared on Twitter by @Nibellion, does not reveal any more tasty tidbits about the PS5 specifically. It has been reported earlier that the PS5 would be going into mass production by June, and Sony has constantly reiterated that “holiday 2020” is the set-in-stone timeline for the console’s worldwide launch.A brief report from Famitsu has a statement from Sony saying that human error is at play here. It’s not really surprising that the company behind the PS5 has already issued a denial, and a closer look at the job listing’s fine print does reveal how a mistake could have been made: “The job listing information is only part of the job listing information held by Recruit Agent, a recruitment agent” - so not directly from Sony. At the time of writing, the official PS5 website is still declaring that the next-gen console “launches holiday 2020”.Erroneous job listing.
