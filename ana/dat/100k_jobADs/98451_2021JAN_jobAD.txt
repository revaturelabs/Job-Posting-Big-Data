At Keller, we respect our drivers and know each and every one of them by name. We’re a small, family-owned company based in Defiance, OH that takes pride in respect, safety, and having a ” family-first” mentality.We realize how difficult it can be at times to maximize your earnings as a Local driver with strictly mileage pay. There is a lot of stopping, starting, dropping, hooking and in some cases, detention. That is why we focus on accessorial and bonus pay structures in addition to mileage pay! We will still put the miles in front of you, but we also want to make sure you’re compensated for every additional event that takes time off your clock throughout the day. Under our updated pay structure Local drivers can expect to gross anywhere from $52,000 to $60,000 annually while being home every single night!
