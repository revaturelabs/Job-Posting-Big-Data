Founded in 1987, TransAm started out with fewer than 100 tractor-trailers. The TransAm headquarters in Olathe, KS has grown in size exponentially and now operates a much larger fleet consisting of over 2,000 tractor-trailers. TransAm provides excellent service to all of their clients, which surpasses client expectations in the temperature-controlled transport industry. Additional to the headquarters in Kansas, TransAm also has a terminal in Rockwall, TX with facilities allocated to drivers as well as maintenance. Similar to the other major carriers in the U.S., there are a lot of TransAm trucking jobs to be had.
