The posts complement monthly issues of The Practicing Writer newsletter, where you’ll always find more listings, none of them limiting eligibility to residents of a single municipality, state, or province. (But this blog does share those more localized opportunities, including jobs.)As always, if you’d like to share a specific opportunity listed here, please credit the blog for the find. Thanks for respecting the time and effort that I put into researching, curating, and posting this information!From The Maine Review: “In honor of Women’s Month, we are offering a free submission period from March 8th to 14th to all of our amazing writers. Hope you’re as excited as we are!!!” (NB: This is another case where they may reach a cap, so if the fee-free poetry/fiction/nonfiction windows on Submittable appear to have closed when you check, that will be why.) Payment: “Fiction and Nonfiction writers will receive a $25 honorarium per published flash (1,000 words or fewer) and a $50 honorarium for work 1,001 words or more. Poets will receive a $25 honorarium per published poem.”From Witness: “LGBTQ+ Writers! Send us your prose! This summer, in honor of the Pride Celebration (June 28th), we are celebrating the voices of writers with queer identities by rolling out a special capsule issue. If you are an LGBTQ+ identifying writer, we want to hear from you.” Deadline: “March 18th or until we reach our maximum submissions.” Pays: “$25 for every 1,500 words of prose.”From Kanstellation: “Issue 3 *tech-themed* subs are open now, until we hit our Submittable allowance or until March 23rd: https://kanstellation.submittable.com/submit.” Pays: “We are offering $60 for each poem, $80 for each flash piece (fiction or nonfiction), and $100 for each essay accepted for publication, paid via PayPal upon acceptance.” (HT @LawrenceSchimel)From Parks & Points: “In April, we will host an online poetry series in honor of National Poetry Month. We invite poetry submissions that reflect upon nature, outdoor exploration, and accompanying moments of adventurousness or self-reflection.” Deadline: March 31. Pays: “We will offer an honorarium of $10 per published poem.”From Susan Fowler at The New York Times: “Getting back into the swing of things after book tour which means… SEND ME YOUR OP-ED PITCHES!” Follow instructions at the tweet. (HT @WeisChoice)In London, “This Is Our Place is a project that will open up space for Londoners to write about nature,” and they’re currently seeking “four writers-in-residence for the project. Writers can be poets / fiction or creative non-fiction writers. Each writer will be given a residency in a London Wildlife Trust location.” Compensation: “There is a fee of £2,400 for this work. This fee is inclusive of VAT, preparation and travel costs. We believe this is around seven days work in total.” Application deadline is March 18, 10am (presumably, London time).

This person will work directly with student journalists to help them advance their skills. This is a half-time position during the academic year, with summers off.”“The Creative Writing MFA Program at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, is searching for an Edelstein-Keller Writer in Residence.
