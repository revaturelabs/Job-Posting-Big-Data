In which case, we highly recommend that you upgrade to a newer version.What is Classic view?Classic view provides all of the familiar essentials that you would expect from our Job Search, such as paged search results and full screen job detail/application pages.Alternative keywords and abbreviationsTo help you search quickly, effectively and to never miss a relevant job we may adjust your search criteria behind the scenes to include similar matching keywords and abbreviations.For example, if you are looking for a senior position you may enter the keyword of 'senior'. Some job postings, however, may refer to senior using the abbreviation 'Snr', meaning those roles may not be matched. In this scenario we will automatically add 'Snr' to your search criteria to bring back every relevant job.Saving SearchesAt the top of the search results you will be able to save your search by clicking on the 'Save' icon.Saving a search allows you to quickly perform the same search again the next time you visit ComputerJobs. They can easily be accessed whilst signed in to your Job Seeker profile. For easy access they are also available on the left side of all search results pages.Receive Job AlertsWe highly recommend enabling Jobs By Email for all of your saved searches. This can be enabled for new searches while saving them (see above) or existing searches once signed in to your Job Seeker profile.International SearchingTo perform a job search across many international countries within one single search, you will need to update your preferred countries or use the link provided in the search box.Mobile SiteContact UsAboutPartnersTermsPrivacyCookiesEast TimorChange CountryUnited KingdomUnited States of AmericaAustraliaCanadaMore countries...ComputerJobs is a registered trademark of JobServe Ltd.
