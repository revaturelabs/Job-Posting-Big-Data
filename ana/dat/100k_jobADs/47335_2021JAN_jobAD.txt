The game has been played in the market town since the 12th Century.The town has light industry, with tourism being a major part of the local economy, so it can be a good location if you're looking for hospitality roles in a quiet location.The average salary in Ashbourne tends to be much lower than the national average. That said, the living costs are also much lower - almost half of what they are in London. This means you can live comfortably for less. Public transport is available, but a car is likely to be essential here. There are local bus links to Derby and Uttoxeter.CoordinatorOffice for National Statistics - CensusENG Stoke-on-TrentJob DescriptionCensus officers Contract duration 2nd intake; 16 March to 29 April 2021 3rd intake; 23 March to 29 April 2021 Hours 2nd intake; 15, 25 or 37 hours per week 3rd intake; 15 or 37 hours per week Salary dependent on location Band 1- £14.61 Band...ApplyApply LaterSaveShareMore Details4 days agoShareCoordinatorFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedInEmail to friendCopy LinkAdministratorOffice for National Statistics - CensusENG Stoke-on-TrentJob DescriptionCensus officers Contract duration 2nd intake; 16 March to 29 April 2021 3rd intake; 23 March to 29 April 2021 Hours 2nd intake; 15, 25 or 37 hours per week 3rd intake; 15 or 37 hours per week Salary dependent on location Band 1- £14.61 Band...ApplyApply LaterSaveShareMore Details4 days agoShareAdministratorFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedInEmail to friendCopy LinkField based operativeOffice for National Statistics - CensusENG Stoke-on-TrentJob DescriptionCensus officers Contract duration 2nd intake; 16 March to 29 April 2021 3rd intake; 23 March to 29 April 2021 Hours 2nd intake; 15, 25 or 37 hours per week 3rd intake; 15 or 37 hours per week Salary dependent on location Band 1- £14.61 Band...ApplyApply LaterSaveShareMore Details4 days agoShareField based operativeFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedInEmail to friendCopy LinkOperativeOffice for National Statistics - CensusENG Stoke-on-TrentJob DescriptionCensus officers Contract duration 2nd intake; 16 March to 29 April 2021 3rd intake; 23 March to 29 April 2021 Hours 2nd intake; 15, 25 or 37 hours per week 3rd intake; 15 or 37 hours per week Salary dependent on location Band 1- £14.61 Band...ApplyApply LaterSaveShareMore Details4 days agoShareOperativeFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedInEmail to friendCopy LinkAlert me to all jobs in AshbourneCreate Job AlertEnter your email address and get up to date job alerts in Ashbourne.Email: [email protected]Job title example: salesLocation example: LeedsSubscribeBy registering on this website you accept JobLookup's Terms and Conditions.Customer Service AssistantOffice for National Statistics - CensusENG Stoke-on-TrentJob DescriptionCensus officers Contract duration 2nd intake; 16 March to 29 April 2021 3rd intake; 23 March to 29 April 2021 Hours 2nd intake; 15, 25 or 37 hours per week 3rd intake; 15 or 37 hours per week Salary dependent on location Band 1- £14.61 Band...ApplyApply LaterSaveShareMore Details4 days agoShareCustomer Service AssistantFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedInEmail to friendCopy LinkCensus officer (Customer Service)Office for National Statistics - CensusENG Stoke-on-TrentJob DescriptionCensus officers Contract duration 2nd intake; 16 March to 29 April 2021 3rd intake; 23 March to 29 April 2021 Hours 2nd intake; 15, 25 or 37 hours per week 3rd intake; 15 or 37 hours per week Salary dependent on location Band 1- £14.61 Band...ApplyApply LaterSaveShareMore Details6 hours agoNEWShareCensus officer (Customer Service)FacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedInEmail to friendCopy LinkCensus officerOffice for National Statistics - CensusENG Stoke-on-TrentJob DescriptionCensus officers Contract duration 2nd intake; 16 March to 29 April 2021 3rd intake; 23 March to 29 April 2021 Hours 2nd intake; 15, 25 or 37 hours per week 3rd intake; 15 or 37 hours per week Salary dependent on location Band 1- £14.61 Band...ApplyApply LaterSaveShareMore Details6 hours agoNEWShareCensus officerFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedInEmail to friendCopy LinkCensus officer - part timeOffice for National Statistics - CensusENG Stoke-on-TrentJob DescriptionCensus officers Contract duration 2nd intake; 16 March to 29 April 2021 3rd intake; 23 March to 29 April 2021 Hours 2nd intake; 15, 25 or 37 hours per week 3rd intake; 15 or 37 hours per week Salary dependent on location Band 1- £14.61 Band...ApplyApply LaterSaveShareMore Details6 hours agoNEWShareCensus officer - part timeFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedInEmail to friendCopy LinkSupport Worker - DerbyDimensions UK LtdENG DerbyJob DescriptionDerby- Support Workers- No Experience Necessary!
