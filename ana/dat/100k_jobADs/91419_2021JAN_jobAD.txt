Clients can be just about anyone, including large corporations, public and governmental institutions, private individuals and charitable foundations.The accountant job description differs based on the type of client, size of institution, and organizational need. Every accountant job description, however, demands forensic-level account examination, analysis of income, expenditures and assets, and advice on how to maximize financial position while meeting tax requirements.All accountants are required to use a mix of technical and soft skills on a daily basis that include the following.| numbers and spreadsheets software | communication | financial analysis | detail-oriented organization | time management | integrity and ethics |Top accounting skillsMath and Number SkillsCommunication SkillsLeadershipCreativityAdaptabilityOrganizationWhat accountants doAs can be expected, all accounting jobs involve servicing accounts in some way for clients, specifically financial accounts. Accountants go through all the details in their clients’ financial accounts to both provide them with financial advice and to accurately prepare tax documents.Accounting for a large business can be a big job, too big for one person, so large companies often hire multiple accountants and divide their responsibilities into specific areas of concentration. In corporations or large firms, some accounting jobs may focus on scrutinizing and preparing tax documents while other accounting jobs may focus on recording and analyzing payments and receivables to provide financial advice to senior managers executives.Small businesses also need accountants for many of the same reasons. If you own a small business, you also may benefit from having an accountant look at your books to make sure the ledgers add up, help you prepare your business’s tax documents, and advise you on how to save money and invest resources more efficiently. Given the diminished volume of work compared to a large corporation, a small business almost always employs only one accountant to take care of all of its needs.Individuals often also benefit from hiring an accountant to help them with financial advice and prepare their individual tax documents regarding savings, investments, assets such as properties, income, charitable donations and expenditures on dependents.''The stereotype of someone sitting under fluorescent lighting behind mountains of papers punching numbers into a calculator is far from the reality of being an accountant today.''The average accountant salary, responsibilities, employment status (self-employed, contracted, etc.) and work environment depend entirely on whether an accountant works for a large corporation, an accounting firm, a small business, or for individuals.What great accountants do1. Great accountants can specializeWhether being a payroll accountant, a tax accountant, a corporate accountant, a real estate or property accountant, a personal accountant, or a public sector accountant, great accountants can find a niche to suits their skills and their clients’ needs.2. Great accountants focus on client needsIt’s hard enough for clients to get a detailed look at their finances and accounts much less to use those details to make a plan for the year or quarter or for upcoming large expenditures. After inspecting accounts and making sure numbers are accurate, great accountants help each client build a strategy going forward based on their specific needs at that time, from paying down debt to financing a property acquisition to hiring new employees to buying a new car.3. Great accountants can be trustedCorporations, non-profit organizations and individual clients alike all have good reasons to want to keep their financial information and planning private. Great accountants form trustworthy relationships that let clients feel comfortable sharing the risks they are willing to take and the difficulties or successes they may be having to get the right advice.Typical day as an accountantWhat an accountant does every day depends on their level of experience, area of concentration, and type of employer. All accountants’ key responsibilities, however, fall into two main categories: 1) gathering, sorting, and verifying financial information and 2) analyzing financial information in order to advise clients on financial strategies and decisions.A junior accountant working for a large accounting firm or a corporation may be assigned to collect financial information and prepare it for tax filings. Numbers-heavy, detail-oriented work like this is meticulous, but it also helps less experienced accountants know their clients’ or their organization’s interests inside and out, thus preparing them for analysis and advisory work further up the chain.A more senior accountant within the same firm or corporation may be assigned only to receive the financial information that junior accountants prepare, analyze it, and advise clients or management on how to make key financial decisions to meet their needs or actualize their business plans. These accountants have more direct responsibility for a firm’s or a corporation’s financial success and are integral players at executive or senior management levels.An accountant with her own practice or who works for a small firm may perform both those functions on a given day depending on client needs.''...accountants enjoy a high level of upward mobility''Large organizations like government offices, non-profit institutions and large firms or businesses may demand their accountants to audit accounts, conduct financial investigations, or perform basic budgeting functions.Meanwhile accountants who are self-employed or who work for smaller organizations have to do basic bookkeeping, file for tax compliance, financial analysis as well as advise clients or colleagues on making important financial decisions or planning.Typical day as an accountantThese are essential responsibilities expected from managerial to executive accounting positions and on down the line.

This is true even for those undertaking accounting internships at accounting firms or large businesses.Entry level accounting positions, typical to public or government accountants, are more widely available. Public accountants’ clients may include businesses, individuals or even sections of some public agencies and involve a wide range of accounting duties while government accountants work directly for a governmental agency and tend to concentrate more on auditing individuals and organizations. These positions require basic accounting skills and may ask for some level of accounting experience either through accounting internships or accountant assistant work.Senior level accounting positions in large firms, corporations, and other large businesses are quite competitive and are often filled internally. These positions require a lot of experience and often an accounting certification to attain. Accountants that make it to this position are either executives themselves or report directly to executives and upper management. They typically either manage a group of other accountants or run internal audits and serve as analysts in order to advise a business or organization on making financial decisions and business planning.Accounting CertificationAs we discussed just above, an accounting certification is not mandatory for all accounting positions but is vastly preferred for senior and executive level accounting positions of a managerial, analytical and advisory nature.

Applicants must have at least 2-3 years experience as an auditor in a government agency to qualify.Accounting skillsEmployers hiring accountants look for the following baseline skills in any accounting cover letter or in answers to accounting interview questions: accounting math and numbers expertise, accurate reporting, detail-oriented auditing, confidentiality and ethical behavior, organization, time-management, and communication.Ideal accounting resumeEntry-level accountantThe ideal accounting resume at the entry level will include a bachelor’s degree in accounting and 2-3 years experience in an accounting position within a field of specialty, forensic accounting or tax accounting for example.

It’s like being a doctor or a pilot; you don’t just walk into it one day and try it out to see if it’s for you. Becoming an accountant takes dedicating years of your life to education and subsequent working experience.Being an accountant is for people who like numbers, poring over details and producing accurate reports. It is also for people who enjoy forming relationships with clients, getting to know what is most important to them regarding their finances, and advising them on making important financial decisions or life or business plans.Being an accountant is also for people who feel comfortable specializing in an area and either moving up the ladder to management or executive status or switching specialties to serve different clients, organizations or departments within an organization.''Behind every good business is a great accountant.''Being an accountant means taking analytical approaches to solving client problems and then communicating your solutions to clients tactfully enough to help them accept your expertise and trust that you understand them well enough to have their best interests in mind.Being an accountant can also mean working long hours around tax season or at the end of fiscal control periods and continued study to obtain and keep up with certification, but it can also mean plenty of flexibility if working for a small accounting firm, small business or having your own practice.The stereotype of someone sitting under fluorescent lighting behind mountains of papers punching numbers into a calculator is far from the reality of being an accountant today.
