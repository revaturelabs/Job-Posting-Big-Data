One class attendee told me, \"Facebook is boring! I want to have real conversations, not just hear someone say 'I baked a cake!' Woo-hoo.\"So--I took two seemingly boring, even unsavory hobbies, and made them the center of my class. Pigeons and snails. That's right. We read from hybrid memoirs about a pigoen fancier whose wife dies of cancer and a woman dealing with chronic illness while observing the life of a snail in a pot of violets beside her bed. I used these hybrid memoirs to give the workshop attendees ideas as to how to forge an authentic voice through everyday interests. We alos mediated, did some journaling and had some very amusing conversaitons about political rants on list servs gone awry, how to write about dog walking and cloud watching in a way that is not corny, and reflections on the statue of The Banker's Heart in downtown San Francisco.Get linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther Appsthe bod poe archiveJanuary 20211September 20202August 20206July 202015June 20204May 20207April 20203March 20203February 20204January 20202December 20193November 20195October 20198September 20192August 201912July 20195June 201912May 20195April 20193March 201910February 20196January 20192December 20183October 20189September 20185August 20185July 201815June 20184May 20183April 20187March 20183January 20183December 20177November 20172October 20175September 20175August 20172July 201712June 20177May 20177April 201713March 201715February 20177January 20177December 20163November 201611October 201612September 201611August 20161May 20161March 20161December 20151October 20151August 20152July 20151May 20151April 20151March 20153February 20151December 20141November 20141October 20141September 20141July 20141June 20141April 20142March 20141January 20141December 20131November 20131October 20131July 20131June 20131May 20132April 20131November 20121June 20121May 20122April 20124February 20121December 20111November 20112September 20111August 20111July 20113June 20113May 20113April 20112January 20113December 20103November 20104October 201012September 20102August 20105Show more Show lessBe in touchamberdipietra@gmail.com415-867-1124@thebodypoetikIG_thebodypoetikPowered by Blogger2020About MeBody / WorksClasses / ConversationsPerformance / PoeticsBlogthe bod poe on TwitterTweets by thebodypoetik"
