New Orleans Police have issued a warrant for his arrest. It’s not for crimes against fashion…(he should have been locked up for that years ago)…it’s for that run in with a paparazzo this week.According to TMZ a misdemeanor warrant for criminal damage to property was issued last night. The former Mr Katy Perry is accused of grabbing a photographer’s iPhone on Mondaywhen he saw him using it to take pictures…and hurling it through the window of a local business. Apparently a rep for Russell Brand contacted the business – a law firm of all things! – and said the Arthur star was willing to pay for the damage but the warrant was still forthcoming.It begs the question. Is Russell Brand losing it? He was such a well behaved English chap when married to Katy Perry. Now he’s gone back to his wild ways. Although a stoush with a snapper is nothing new. Ask Sean Penn, Britney Spears, Adam Lambert or Woody Harrelson. They’ve all been there.Russell tried to joke his way out of the incident – but obviously no-one was laughing. The funny man blamed Steve Jobs for his violent outburst. Yes …Steve Jobs! He made some lame-ass excuse that he was protecting the former Apple CEO’s good name ‘Since Steve Jobs died I cannot bear to see anyone use an iphone irreverently, what I did was a tribute to his memory.’ That didn’t go down very well and here we are three days later with Russell facing big legal problems.RELATED POSTSKaty Perry Soaks Up The Sun In HawaiiRussell Brand And Katy Perry Didn’t Have A Prenup: Their Divorce Could Get Messy!Russell Brand Dumped Katy Perry Over Substance Abuse IssuesKaty Perry’s Side Of The Story, Russell Brand Was Crazy (Photo)Russell Brand Says He Is ‘Quite Well’ Without Katy PerryKaty Perry Steps Out In Vegas (Photo)Is Russell Brand Losing His Mind?Katy Perry Thinks She Sees A UFO – Was It Russell Brand?Eric Learns Quinn Spiked Brooke’s Drink – Demands Divorce - HHVanessa Marcil Return Rumors Heat Up – Shares GH Throwback Pic - GHTGH Couple Switch Coming – Bye Bye Ned, Olivia & Robert Bring Fun And Adventure! - SOSSEE KRIS JENNER'S SAGGY BARE BREAST - WARNING GROSS! - TFGH Neil Might Be A Plant – Secretly Working For Cyrus? - HHIs GH JaSam Pregnant?
