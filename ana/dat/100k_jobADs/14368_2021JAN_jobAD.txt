Jay Nixon’s budget cuts announcedAs we await the governor’s press conference this morning regarding budget cuts and layoffs, we did a little research on the government’s recovery.gov website. So far, the Show-Me-State has received $145, 966, 231, in “stimulus” funds – which according to the government – has created or “saved” 474.72 jobs. (feel sorry for whoever is .72!) What a scam and a costly one at that!First, the Obama Administration still hasn’t explained to us how they calculate “jobs saved.” And second, that $145 million equates to over $300,000 a job!
