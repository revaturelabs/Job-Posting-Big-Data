Wellborn, P.A. | Aug 19, 2018 | Firm News |Studies indicate that when people are released from prison, their greatest concern is finding a job. Some are no longer young, others are inexperienced and there are those who still struggle with substance abuse and other issues.However, at both state and federal levels, there is a push to help former inmates find work. In South Carolina, the initiatives are working.Low unemployment opens the doorThe unemployment numbers are low in South Carolina, and businesses in our state are having trouble finding enough people to fill job openings. Enter the former inmate. While in prison, many people obtain their high school or college degrees, while others hone their skills in work they know or participate in training for new job opportunities.Checking the boxFormer inmates often have promising job interviews, but applications normally have a section with a little box that indicates whether the applicant has a criminal history. Background checks are common, and when the interviewer sees that the box has been checked, he or she is likely to choose an applicant with a clean record.The pilot programIn 2014, the State Department of Employment and Workforce opened a pilot program called Second Chance. Unlike programs that focus on training for specific kinds of jobs, this one assists inmates in writing a resume, applying for a position and preparing for job interviews. The program also provides guidance on the important task of explaining a conviction to a potential employer. One facility at which the program has been successful is the Manning Correctional Institution in Columbia. In addition to programs like this one, state and federal agencies have put together other incentives such as job fairs specifically for the benefit of former inmates.Finding the way backFor those who are coming out of prison, landing a job can be a tremendous confidence-builder. While they are incarcerated, people have a lot of time to think about their future, and being able to earn an honest living provides stability and goes a long way toward helping former inmates rejoin society.FacebookTwitterLinkedInSearch for:CategoriesCriminal Defense (25)Drug Charges (106)Drunk Driving (73)Felonies (9)Firm News (339)Internet Crimes (12)Sex Crimes (48)Violent Crimes (29)White Collar Crimes (69)ArchivesJanuary 2021 (1)December 2020 (2)November 2020 (3)October 2020 (2)September 2020 (3)August 2020 (3)July 2020 (3)June 2020 (3)May 2020 (2)April 2020 (3)March 2020 (2)February 2020 (12)December 2019 (1)November 2019 (2)October 2019 (7)September 2019 (1)July 2019 (2)June 2019 (3)May 2019 (4)April 2019 (2)March 2019 (1)February 2019 (1)January 2019 (2)December 2018 (6)November 2018 (6)October 2018 (4)September 2018 (6)August 2018 (5)July 2018 (8)June 2018 (6)May 2018 (5)April 2018 (5)March 2018 (6)February 2018 (5)January 2018 (5)December 2017 (6)November 2017 (5)October 2017 (5)September 2017 (5)August 2017 (7)July 2017 (3)June 2017 (4)May 2017 (5)April 2017 (4)March 2017 (4)February 2017 (4)January 2017 (5)December 2016 (4)November 2016 (5)October 2016 (4)September 2016 (3)August 2016 (5)July 2016 (4)June 2016 (4)May 2016 (5)April 2016 (4)March 2016 (5)February 2016 (4)January 2016 (4)December 2015 (4)November 2015 (4)October 2015 (5)September 2015 (3)August 2015 (5)July 2015 (5)June 2015 (4)May 2015 (4)April 2015 (4)March 2015 (5)February 2015 (4)January 2015 (4)December 2014 (5)November 2014 (4)October 2014 (4)September 2014 (6)August 2014 (3)July 2014 (5)June 2014 (4)May 2014 (5)April 2014 (4)March 2014 (4)February 2014 (4)January 2014 (5)December 2013 (4)November 2013 (6)October 2013 (3)September 2013 (4)August 2013 (4)July 2013 (5)June 2013 (5)May 2013 (4)April 2013 (4)March 2013 (4)February 2013 (4)January 2013 (2)Recent PostsSelling gift cards could lead to money laundering chargesDoes a criminal conviction affect my ability to secure a job?Why is insider trading illegal?What does South Carolina law consider drug paraphernalia?Racial bias continues to impact people in the U.S. justice systemSubscribe To This Blog’s FeedTell Us About Your Case – Schedule A Free ConsultationTo schedule a confidential appointment with an experienced South Carolina criminal defense attorney, please call 803-746-4302 or fill out this form:Email Us TodayChristopher A.
