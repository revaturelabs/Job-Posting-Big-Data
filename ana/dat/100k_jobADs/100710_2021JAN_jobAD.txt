Click Here!About the ForumWe need youth to have access to a space where they are able to discuss youth-specific migration challenges, needs and opportunities, in order to consolidate solid policy priorities around the key issues of migration and development.It is for this reason that the UN MGCY is organizing the Youth Forum. The Youth Forum’s programme will discuss key issues identified in last year’s summit, including education and decent jobs for youth migrants, and on the themes related to the GFMD agenda, including “facilitating the economic and social inclusion of migrants”, “providing regular pathways from crisis to safety”, and “shaping public narratives on migrants and migration”. The Youth Forum programme is built to be highly pertinent to these issues discussed during the GFMD Summit, as this allows the outcomes of the Youth Forum to feed into the rountables of the GFMD.During the Youth Forum, they will add focuses on youth priority themes, such as Education and Child Detention, and will endeavour to discuss the other topics with a youth lens. They will also focus on identifying already existing youth-led and/or youth-focused actions on these issues and present ways to scale or replicate them in partnership with other stakeholders. In each session, they will also make sure they consider specific vulnerabilities and opportunities related to gender, ethnicity, LGBTQ+, and disability.Recommended:CHECK SCHOLARSHIPS OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDY ABROAD CLICK HERE!MODE OF APPLICATION: APPLY ONLINEFundingUN MGCY is working hard to raise funds and might be able to offer scholarships based on merit and need – with special attention to under-represented countries and populations, especially from Low Income Countries.
