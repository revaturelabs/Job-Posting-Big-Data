"SHOULD I QUIT MY DAY JOB?HomeWatchlistChallengeBlogCryptoContactTestimonialsComicsBook OnlineMore...SHOULD I QUIT MY DAY JOB?Hey I did it and also know many others that have also. What is that you ask? I quit working for the man and the day job from 9 to 5 and became a ProTrader. Now my job description consists of day trading the open of the stock market for 60 mninutes each morning and making enough money to hit goals and be done for the day. See when you have an underpromise and overdeliver atttiude, trade like a business, man!! not a trader - yes you can win at this in big way!!!!Now, do you have what it takes to be a ProTrader? Every single day, my twitter inbox is filled up with people asking me what it takes to be a day trader. They see my page and the profits my followers are making, and they want in. Great, of course we always have extra room on the MOJO Team, but the questions is: do you have what it takes? Day trading is not a walk in the park, many try to day trade and many fail. You hear it that 9 out of 10 day traders fail. Well the actual number is more like 7.5 out of 10 but thats still pretty sad and discouraging for people that want in but feel this is a big hurdle. Well it's really not and the strong do survive, it is truly a dog eat dog world out there. Luckily for you, I am going to be hosting a webinar on Wednesday, July 8th at 8pm est. The topic of discussion will be: “Should you really quit your day job and trade for a living?”Honestly, what I say may come as a wakeup call to some of you. Day trading is certainly not for everyone and you really have to be committed to be spending the time and money required to excel in this industry. For example, I am an excellent golfer and have been a stand out athlete my whole life. I do get picked first or I am the captain (like that). However, as I got a bit older, I saw the guys my age putting up better golf scores than what I was regularly shooting. What did I do? Well, I didn’t sit around and wish to get better. I found the best golf coach in town and signed up for a few lessons. I also committed myself to diligent practice and study. You know what happened? I improved my game and now I am shooting better than the guys I used to envy. That’s how it works. It’s really that simple. If you want something, you have to go get it, no matter what is in your way. If you just sit around and wish, you may as well write a letter to Santa Claus asking for it, because your dreams are not going to suddenly be delivered to you without real hard work.Day Trading is just like sports, you need the mindset of an elite athlete. Day traders have drive, ambition and aggression. Day traders are able to execute split second decisions without second guessing themselves and without allowing human emotion to get in the way. A winning day trader surveys the action and is so skilled and experience it is second nature to them to find the winning trade and execute it flawlessly. Take ProTrader Alan for example. When I call out a trade play, Alan is right there with me. He does not second guess what we are trying to do and he does not stray from the reservation. He simply is in the zone, he sees the action and executes his plan to perfection. That is why he averages $2,000 of profit a day and why he is the million dollar man. Trust me, he would not have gotten to that point without the skills I discuss above.Simply put, successful day traders are an elite group of people. They are the best of the best. Everyone wants to log into the MOJO Day Trading Room for an hour in the morning and earn the type of profits you see from ProTrader Alan or ProTrader Colin. They are making amazing money and it is deserving of praise, but you also have to recognize the skills, traits, attributes and work that comes together to make their success possible. Listen, these guys have been with me from the start. We are a team and they are a part of my starting 5. They are the 1% of the 1%, the best of the best. But, recognize the years of work we have put in together.Success comes from preparation and hard work. Take Peyton Manning for example. He is one of the best quarterbacks of all time. Obviously, he is a very gifted athlete, but what stands out most about Peyton Manning is his high level of preparation. Nobody watches more film than Peyton Manning. Nobody knows more about his opponent than Peyton Manning. He is obsessed with learning everything he possibly can about his opponents, so much so that he can walk up to the line of scrimmage and immediately recognize the opponents defensive set and know what to do to best exploit this. He has such a high level of preparation that it is second nature for him to quickly scan the defense and immediately know what to do. It is like a skilled and tenured poker player who has a great hand but is facing pressure from a raise and just has a deep internal feeling that they know their hand is no good so they fold. It is an innate skill that the best of the best have.Check out this video with Peyton Manning’s former coach Tony Dungy discussing Manning’s high level of preparation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ59VVXoOn4What stood out to me most about this video was the high level of respect Tony Dungy has for Peyton Manning. It is obvious that is a results of the hard work and dedication Dungy has seen Manning put into play. He knows that Manning goes into every game fully prepared thanks to his legendary work ethic. Manning prepares for the game by doing everything exactly how it will be done in the game. This is exactly what I am trying to do with MOJO University. In MOJO University, we practice putting orders in just like we would in real trades, if you don’t get your order in on time, you are out, you missed the price and lost your money. Exactly how it would go down if the market was open. We treat it like it is the real thing, so when you start trading with us in the MOJO Day Trading Room for real, you are ready to go and it is second nature, you won’t hesitate and you won’t question, you will be exactly like ProTrader Alan, a money making machine. In MOJO University, I will build up your skills until you are able to survey the action on level 2 and are able to execute split second decisions. The MOJO ProTraders know to buy and sell without my signal. Why? Because they put in the time and preparation required to get to that point. They put up the money for MOJO U and set their mind to making day trading their profession. This is not an easy task, and like I said earlier, it is certainly not for everyone. You need to drive, ambition and aggression. I can’t teach you that, you either have it or you don’t, but I can teach you to trade like a Pro.I’ll leave you with a final thought about the Peyton Manning video. In the video, Tony Dungy tells a story about Peyton Manning’s Super Bowl preparation. Manning heard that it may rain on weather reports, so he went to Dungy and asked to practice with wet balls. Dungy told him not to worry, that it would only rain for 20 minutes. Manning knew the value of proper preparation, so he went ahead and practiced all week with wet balls, expecting it to rain. That Sunday, during the Super Bowl, it rained the whole game. You know who lifted the Super Bowl trophy that night? Peyton Manning. Why? Because he knew that he would get a step ahead of his competition with proper preparation. He was ready for anything. If it rained, he was going to be on the top of his game because he trained himself to throw with a wet ball.At MOJO Day Trading, we will prepare you for anything. If you take MOJO University and really put your heart and mind into it, you are going to be a successful day trader. Nobody is going to work harder as your mentor, I can assure you of that. So if you are ready to quit driving through traffic to that boring desk job, check out my website and get in touch. We are always looking to add traders with a winner’s mindset to our team. Be warned, the MOJO Team is an elite team of day traders who treat this like a business, because it is one. We are all business owners and you can be too, but you have to bring the winners mentality that we are looking for.To get started, go here: CLICK HERETags:free classFeatured PostsWhat is shorting a
