You may also record physician findings in patient records.But your work is not just administrative. Cardiovascular technologists prepare, maintain, and operate medical imaging equipment.This includes using ultrasound and xray fluoroscopy to view the heart. You will need to be able to understand the difference between good and bad images.Although ultrasound is noninvasive, a cardiovascular tech may assist a physician with invasive procedures i.e., inserting cardiac catheters through an artery to the heart.Technologists dont do the insertion, but they do the preparation. They shave and clean the area where the catheter will be inserted. They may also administer local anesthetic and monitor a patients vitals during the procedure.Cardiovascular technologists and technicians also use electrocardiogram equipment to monitor the heart.The EKG is a monitor that contains wires that attach to the patients chest, arms, and legs via electrodes. A tech needs to know how to operate and read an EKG.Where do cardio techs work?The most common work environment is hospitals, physicians office, laboratories and outpatient care centers.This is a very physical job, which involves long periods of standing and walking, along with lifting or turning patients.Because hospitals are a common employer, expect to work emergency hours, including weekends, evenings, and overnights. But that may change.Technology has improved, and the cost for medical imaging equipment has gone down. This may mean many physicians offices or laboratories may begin to employ and staff cardiovascular technicians during typical office hours.Cardiovascular tech payThe average median wage for cardiovascular technologists was $49,410 in 2010, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook.Finding a cardiovascular tech job should not be too difficult in the coming years: Expected growth from 2010 to 2020 is 29 percent.The increase is expected because the baby boomer generation, which makes up about 26 percent of the United states population, is now at retirement age and will need medical care in the future.Cardiovascular technician certification and educationMany cardiovascular technicians have an associates degree in the medical field. Their degree program may focus on invasive or noninvasive cardiovascular technology.Many, though, will come from a background in radiologic technology and will have on the job training. This involves learning to use EKG equipment.Although certification is not required, an employer may value that because that is the standard in which all medical professions operate.Skills of cardiovascular techWorking under a physician, a vascular technician needs to follow specific orders from them.People skills are important, too. Because many patients are in extreme duress, you have to have outstanding interpersonal skills to get the patient to cooperate.A cardiovascular tech, who will be on their feet all day and moving patients, needs to have physical stamina and technical skills.The technical skills are needed because the machinery that is operated is complex.I hope this cardiovascular technician job description information has been s help to you.articles	Articles10 Highest Paying Nursing Jobs in the World10 Non-Clinical Nursing Jobs: Forget the Hospital or Clinic!10 Nursing School Interview Questions (And How To Answer Them)2 Year Degrees in the Medical Field4 Year Degrees in the Medical Field: What Am I Qualified for?5 Celebration Ideas for Nurses Week5 Reasons To Go from CNA To RNAthletic Trainer Job Description and SalaryAudiologist Education Requirements and TrainingBest Blood Pressure Cuff for Nurses and Nursing StudentsBest Calculator for Statistics: Ho Hum for Graphing Probability!Best Graduation Gifts for Nursing Students: 10 Unique Ideas!Best Stethoscope for Medical StudentsBest Watch for a Nurse in 2015Can a Nurse Become a Doctor?
