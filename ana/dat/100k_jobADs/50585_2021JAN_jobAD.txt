The Job Design process was developed by Dr. Gerald D. Bell as a way to help leaders identify the most important things to work on; to develop specific, measurable, well thought-out goals and plans; and to do so in a way that promotes teamwork, collaboration, cross-functional communication, and accountability. It also provides a solid basis for performance reviews and performance management. The Job Design process is also taught in Bell Leadership’s Selecting Achievers and Leader’s Job seminars.Press ReleasesCongratulations to our February Achievers!
