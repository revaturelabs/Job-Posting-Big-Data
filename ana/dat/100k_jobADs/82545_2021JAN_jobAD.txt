And where is the place of understanding?13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; Neither is it found in the land of the living.14 The deep saith, It is not in me; And the sea saith, It is not with me.15 It cannot be gotten for gold, Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.17 Gold and glass cannot equal it, Neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.18 No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal: Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.20 Whence then cometh wisdom? And where is the place of understanding?21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, And kept close from the birds of the heavens.22 Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears.23 God understandeth the way thereof, And he knoweth the place thereof.24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, And seeth under the whole heaven; 25 To make a weight for the wind: Yea, he meteth out the waters by measure.26 When he made a decree for the rain, And a way for the lightning of the thunder; 27 Then did he see it, and declare it; He established it, yea, and searched it out.28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.Chapter 28 of 42 < Prev 1 ← 26 27 28 29 30 → 42 Next >Log in with FacebookLog in with GoogleYour name or email address:Do you already have an account?No, create an account now.Yes, my password is:Forgot your password?Stay logged inLog In / Sign UpLog in with FacebookLog in with GoogleRelated Postsangelhug(04/28/02)Scripture for the day ...
