I didn‚Äôt even expect myself to go through this process because I thought I would go straight into full time Real Estate salesperson work since I got my license last July. Nonetheless, I began this journey, and am now still deciding if I want to enter the Fashion related industry or go back to Real Estate‚Ä¶ It will more or less depend on what the results of my last interview is, in two weeks times. I still continue to trust in God to provide the best way and career for me. üôÇI have been home most of the time during this holiday, if I am not out meeting my friends for lunch, coffee and movie or church related activities.Recently I began to watch documentaries on Youtube channel ‚ÄúMy Shocking Story‚Äù and have been so inspired by the families and individuals who didn‚Äôt let their handicap or disabilities let them down! I am so inspired to want to live my life to the fullest as well.I have also been doing a fair bit of reading. I‚Äôve finished reading and or gleaming through a handful of books on Emotionally Intelligence. Did you know that we first FEEL in our brains before we THINK and rationalize? That‚Äôs why every decision we‚Äôve ever made was first based emotionally before rationally. And therefore it is important to let ourselves cool down and take time to think through before we make big decisions in life. Also, when we are in conflicts, to breath deeply to allow our rational mind to think clearly before we act or react based on our emotions which often can be reckless.Recently finished reading this handy book based on the life of young Thai businessman who is the founder of Tao Kae Noi, a famous fried seaweed brand. The book and his life is inspiring because he is innovative, saw every problem as an opportunity to overcome and develop his business to become bigger.It is stories like his that inspires me.I want to become someone like Tao Kae Noi founder, but there are also many things holding me back, fear of failure, lack of resources, fear of lack of discipline, consistency and perseverance. That is why I want to first overcome all these fears with work experiences and gain the network and experiences and successes before I will embark on my own business and projects with hopefully the right partners that God will send.That is all for now!Be Beautiful, Inside & Out. üôÇ<3EnaRelated articlesStory of The Founder of Tao Kae Noi ‚Äì Chapter 3 (improveonepercentaday.wordpress.com)The Billionaire (thesubtlelessons.wordpress.com)Share this:FacebookTwitterEmailMoreRedditPocketLinkedInPrintTumblrGooglePinterestRelatedBusinessEmotionReadingSeaweedTao Kae NoiThoughtYoutubePost navigationPrevious PostWhat is Fashion Marketing & Management?Next PostA New Fashion Video Platform	Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
