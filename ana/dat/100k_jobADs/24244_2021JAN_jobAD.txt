The main cause of this will be increased automation, whereby humans are replaced by technologies capable of handling the same job.IoT causes mass job lossesConnected chips, gadgets and machinery will have detrimental effects in areas such as office work, support and maintenance, it’s thought. Only more skilled employees – such as network engineers and robotics coordinators – will keep their jobs.The connected tech market will consist of 5 percent of the global technology industry and will make $15,000 within the next few years, according to Nasscom.Booming investmentIndia currently contributes $1.6 billion to the global IoT industry, says Zinnov, but this will reach $7.3 billion by 2021. The country’s corporate sector is driving the industry, making up 80 percent of the country’s overall contribution.The government only funds 20 percent of the domestic IoT market, perhaps due to a lack of understanding and interest in the area. Firms, on the other hand, are looking for ways to save money and streamline their operations.Related: IT managers fear Internet of Things skills shortageAutomation to affect whole tech sectorRecently, US tech analyst HfS Research said the technology sector in India will lose more than 4 million jobs by 2021. This, it claimed, will come down to companies automating low-skilled jobs.Hardik Tiwari, engagement lead at Zinnov, told the Economic Times that thousands of jobs will be affected in India. However, countries like the UK and US will also be impacted in similar ways.“Internet-of-things technology will impact 120,000 jobs in the country by 2021. 94,000 jobs will be eliminated, and 25,000 jobs will be created in the five-year period,” he said.Tiwari explained that service companies are reaching out to IoT companies with unique products, something that’ll help the Indian IoT develop into a global leader.“There is a lot of demand from service providers for niche internet-for-things players with intellectual property and platforms. This will help increase the industry’s market share.”Automation needs careNitin Rakesh, CEO and president of global IT and business solutions provider Syntel, told Internet of Business that companies experimenting with automation need to ensure they have “robust” strategies in place.“A robust and holistic approach to enterprise automation provides a central backbone that empowers companies to modernise so they can survive and thrive in the two-speed world and harness the capabilities of the new IoT paradigm.,” he said.“As the IoT tidal wave gathers strength, a gap is emerging between companies reliant on ageing legacy systems and the growing demand for digital connectivity by consumers. This digital disconnect will create unprecedented challenges for companies across a many sectors, including banking, insurance, healthcare and manufacturing.“In order for companies to become IoT ready, they must find a way to unlock the data within their legacy systems whilst upgrading to more modern digital platforms that support the constant stream of real-time data that IoT-connected devices generate.”Related: This study suggests some enterprises are flying blind with the Internet of ThingsSOURCEThe Economic TimesTAGSIoT jobsresearchNicholas FearnFeatured Resources – DISABLEDMay 12 & 13 2020Santa Clara, USAFind out more »June 15 – 17 2020Chicago, ILFind out more »Subscribe to our Newsletter – IoB InsightsReceive the latest IoT news and analysis in your industry, straight to your inbox.Email*Name*Job Title*Company*listcodeThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.Featured ResourcesWhite Paper Why LoRaWAN® Is the Logical Choice For Asset-Tracking ConnectivityDownload Now »White Paper Fundamentals of the Digital Supply ChainDownload Now »White Paper IoT Security: What Engineering Leaders Need to KnowDownload Now »White Paper Reinventing the IoT Platform for Discrete ManufacturersDownload Now »White Paper Human + Machine: Augmented Intelligence Amplifies Performance in the WorkplaceDownload Now »White Paper Triton 2.0 & the Future of OT Cyber-AttacksDownload Now »IoB EventsMay 24 – 26 2021VIRTUALFind out more »May 24 – 26 2021VIRTUALFind out more »5G & ConnectivityAI & Machine LearningEdge to CloudEngineering & DevelopmentManufacturing & Supply ChainProduct & UX DesignSecurityGuest OpinionsAnalysisResearchVideosUnited States501 Boylston StBoston, MA 02116781-247-1830Email[email protected]Data Protection, Privacy Policy & Terms and ConditionsCookie PolicyAbout UsContact Us© Copyright 2020 - Cambridge Innovation Institute>'); var formated_str = arr_splits[i].replace(/\\surl\\(\\'(?!data\\:)/gi, function regex_function(str) { return ' url(\\'' + dir_path + '/' + str.replace(/url\\(\\'/gi, '').replace(/^\\s+|\\s+$/gm,''); }); splited_css += \"\"; } var td_theme_css = jQuery('link#td-theme-css'); if (td_theme_css.length) { td_theme_css.after(splited_css); } } }); } })();This site uses cookies: Find out more.Okay, thank you"
