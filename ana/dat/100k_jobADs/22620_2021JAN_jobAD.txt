Weâ€™re anxious for the winter break to come.The first term of my MBA is almost finished â€“ only one more week! I am continuing to do well. So far Iâ€™ve gotten all Aâ€™s on my assignments. On the tests I have gotten Aâ€™s and Bâ€™s. In high school I only got on the B honour roll onceâ€¦and I think that was a fluke! Of course, I didnâ€™t really try very hard in HS ðŸ™‚ Hopefully with the MBA Iâ€™ll be able to keep my grades high.As soon as the winter break is over I will head right into the Spring Term. I just registered for the classes, but right now Iâ€™m just trying to focus on my last few projects and tests for this term.In other news: Our job situation is kinda up in the air. One of our students will most likely go to a normal school (as oppposed to home-school) next year. Our other studentâ€™s parents want us to continue teaching their son, but with only one student our company probably wonâ€™t offer the same kind of compensation package. But all is not lost. There are still a couple of options for usâ€¦weâ€™ll just have to see what happens. We just have to trust that He will lead us to the right situations.J, JK & A-Maewww.jalopyhead.v33.orgLeave a Reply Cancel replyProudly powered by WordPress and LESS by Jared Erickson (and tweaked by Jeremy N.
