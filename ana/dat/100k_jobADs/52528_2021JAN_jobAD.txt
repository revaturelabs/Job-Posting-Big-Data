They provide care, not only for military servicemembers and their families, but also for people in need around the globe. Working with a team of talented colleagues united by a common mission, Navy Nurses have the opportunity to educate, lead and shape policy within Navy Health Care. They also: * Apply leading-edge medical advances at world-class hospitals * Utilize some of the most advanced technology on the planet, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), which can lead to less paperwork and more meaningful patient care * Work at the best military nursing facilities on shore, at sea and in the field RESPONSIBILITIES As an active duty Navy Nurse, you'll provide high-quality nursing care, doing everything a typical nurse would do in a variety of settings: * Military treatment facilities (in the U.S. and overseas) * Austere environments (i.e. deployments, humanitarian aid missions) * Onboard ships (aircraft carriers, hospital ships) Nursing in an austere environment could mean taking part in humanitarian relief efforts, such as administering infant vaccinations in developing countries, or providing emergency care to victims of a natural disaster. Navy Nurses collaborate with physicians, surgeons, cardiologists and fellow nurses as colleagues and equals. Navy Nursing provides opportunities to develop leadership skills that will set you apart. WORK ENVIRONMENT Active Duty Navy Nurses may serve at any one of more than 250 Navy and medical facilities around the globe, from Hawaii to Japan, Germany to Guam, and Washington, D.C., to Washington state. As a Navy Nurse, you could work at one of the highly acclaimed National Naval Medical Centers in Bethesda, Md.; Portsmouth, Va.; and San Diego, Calif. Or you could provide medical support aboard one of two dedicated hospital ships: the USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy. More opportunities are available stateside and abroad - aboard a surface ship, working closely with a nearby aircraft squadron, or even with the Fleet Marine Force.
