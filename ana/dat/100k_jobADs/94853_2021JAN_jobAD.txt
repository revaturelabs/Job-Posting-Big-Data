If she wasn't at school, she was at the gym. Years later, her exceptional talent allowed her to follow her dreams to become a member of the University of Vermont gymnastics team. But one day, while practicing a routine move, tragedy struck: she slipped and all but destroyed her knee. She was beyond crushed. But Jennifer had no intentions of retiring. Although the rehabilitation was intense and very painful, Jennifer managed to recover and compete in her senior year.With such an inspirational personal story, it is no wonder that today Jennifer works with athletes as a Mental Toughness Trainer at the Boston offices of Head Games, a Phoenix-based private practice devoted to the mental health of athletes, coaches, and parents. Jennifer chose to enter into Sport Psychology after recalling the assistance and motivation she needed when recovering from her own injury. \"I decided that I wanted to go into sports psychology to work with athletes attempting to overcome obstacles. I wanted to be the catalyst that injured athletes need to help them fully recover, both mentally and physically, from injuries. I know I could have used that!\"Realizing that Sport Psychology is not the most common of career fields, Jennifer began looking into specific programs at various universities. She was pleased with the unique curriculum and more hands-on approach available within the Argosy University, Phoenix Sport and Exercise Psychology program. When looking back on her education, Jennifer notes the obvious benefits of the high student-professor interaction. \"One of the biggest ways that Argosy University, Phoenix has helped my career has been the connections I made with the professors. They were all very approachable, and they genuinely cared about the success of each and everyone of their students.\"As an associate at Head Games, Jennifer spends her time educating individual athletes, teams, coaches, and parents on the value of Mental Toughness Training. In addition to dealing with the psychological aspect of sports, Jennifer also has a passion for assisting athletes in their transition from the 'sport world' to the 'real world'. She even works an additional job as an Employment Specialist/Career Counselor with the hopes of eventually working with student-athletes in the career advisement arena.Today, Jennifer reflects upon her fifteen years in competitive sports with absolutely no regrets. She has found that the lessons one needs in order to achieve excellence in sports are identical to the lessons ones needed to achieve excellence in life. \"In today's society, winning is everything, and that kind of mentality can obviously have a disastrous effect on athletes. But sports are a wonderful thing. I wouldn't be where or who I am today without them. I firmly believe that what can be learned in sports can be applied to life. The experiences that people find as a result of being involved in sports can directly influence who they will become. That is why I believe Sports Psychology is such a powerful and crucial tool.\"\"One of the biggest ways that Argosy University, Phoenix has helped my career has been the connections I made with the professors.
