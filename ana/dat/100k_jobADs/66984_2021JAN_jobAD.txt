I worked with Destiny to secure a position at [one of the nation’s largest health systems as a] Senior CIS analyst. Ms Quinn demonstrated herself as professional, courteous, knowledgeable, and customer focused and she worked closely with me during the entire process.?One of the reasons why I am leaving my current employer is the lack of recognition to celebrate or promote employees that are high performers; Ms. Quinn definitely presented herself in this way. My personal thanks goes out to Ms. Quinn and Valintry for a job well done. In addition, I will make sure to refer Valintry to others. Thanks again!?This position is requiring me to relocate from Los Angeles, CA to Orlando, FL and while this was a big decision, Ms. Quinn mitigated any anxieties I had by providing me with the information and resources that would support my decision to accept this offer.– Jonathan, CIS Analyst?[received 09/16/2014]“I have been employed through Valintry going five months. Destiny called me, got me an interview and a job within days. I have worked for several staffing companies and have never been treated this well. They are always available when you need them.”– Anonymous Glassdoor review [received 01/28/2015]“I’ve worked for them for about 6 months now. I’m located in a different state so all my contact with them has been over the phone/email but that has never been a problem. They are always very prompt to reply when I’ve talked to them and helpful in getting timely answers to any questions. I would certainly recommend them to anybody looking for an agency to sign on with”– Anonymous Glassdoor review?[received 01/31/2015]Title:?Good Company, Growth Potential“Small, responsive company whose local officers have excellent connections in the area inferring great growth potential. The onboarding was smooth, first paycheck was issued without a hiccup, and the staff has been supportive and helpful.”– Anonymous VALiNTRY employee in Nashville, TN on Glassdoor [received 07/06/2015]“Valintry actually does what they say they will do, unlike most staffing firms I’ve worked with who never call you back unless they finally need you again. Destiny Quinn was my recruiter and she was amazing – she always called me to provide me with an update, I never had to guess where I was at in the process, and she was always professional and extremely knowledgeable. She knows what she’s talking about and I wish more recruiting firms had the same high level of customer service! She got me the position within 2 weeks!”– Anonymous Glassdoor review?[received 07/30/2015]“Tony,I wanted to express my appreciation for you meeting with me and submitting me as a candidate [to your client in Nashville.]?I enjoyed meeting you and speaking with you.
