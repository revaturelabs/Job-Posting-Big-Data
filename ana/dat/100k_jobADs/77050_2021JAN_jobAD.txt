Her communication skills are exemplary, both in listening to our needs and keeping us informed of how things are going during the recruitment process. She has in-depth technical knowledge of the accounting industry. We chose Konnexus because we knew they would find us the right candidates quickly and efficiently, without us having to invest a lot of time working through hundreds of resumes. The process was quick, but thorough. The candidates we interviewed were a good fit for our business and had the technical skills necessary to do the job. We would absolutely recommend them; it’s been a great experience working with Zoë at Konnexus. The one attribute I love about working with her is that she recognises my time is valuable and fits around me where necessary.— Trudi, Head of FinanceContact usLet’s talk andgrab a coffee44 Lakeview DriveScoresby VIC 3179hello@konnexuscg.com.au03 9052 5900Konnexus - Accounting Recruitment and IT Recruitment5.0Based on 21 reviews***Upload ResumeAccepted file types: pdf, doc, docx, rtf.*Monthly NewsletterClick here if you would rather not receive our monthly newsletterCommentsThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.Follow usHead to our blogSubscribe to our newsletter© Copyright - Konnexus Company Group 2020 | SitemapScroll to topThis site uses cookies.
