I am now at a point where I have enough experience to move on.I have tried Indeed and other common forms of finding work but its like finding a needle in a haystack just the odd oppurtunity that comes up. I find this way is time intensive with little results.So I have been looking into other ways of finding work, these are the ones I have come up with:- Messaging Hiring manages on LinkedIn for discussions (this way through conversation they have found me roles of which it would appear I am underqualified for but due to the companies needing somebody ASAP they will comprimise, I got one job offer through this method for a managerial role of which I was underqualified for, I am expecting a phone interview soon)- Sending emails out to companies directly with a CV/Resume for them to keep on file- Sprucing up my LinkedIn profile, this way I get people adding me reguarly interested in offering me roles.What are some things other people have tried? What other methods would you recommend?Don't like ads? Remove them while supporting the forum.

A presentation of your business plan, a hand written note (shows dedication and drive), a video perhaps? Anything that takes you away from the norm and showing value to the employer!Today, if I was really desperate for a recruiter's help, I'd go into their office with a box of krispee cremes and introduce myself, you'll soon enough get some recruiters helping you... think about it, 10 recruiters with 10 jobs on each, you'll definitely get an interview if you're any good!ReplyReactions: SinghSep 3, 2016Thread starter#4SinghContributorRead Millionaire FastlaneSpeedway PassFeb 27, 20168694136UKThanks for you input guys, I am also going to try sending out a few letters with resumes via Post directly to the recruitment managers within companies of my chosen field (most names I can find through their websites or through their facebook pages) and see what kind of responses I get.Since my post @Scot I've now added tons of targeted recruiters on LinkedIn and will be sending them personalised Inmails once they connect.@H Dog I paid someone to get my LinkedIn as best it can be with a nice professional picture of me.

I've used that over a dozen times and have gotten plenty of jobs within a few days.Another tactic is to apply for a lower position and then try switch the job in the interview.

Make sure all of your social media posts are squeaky clean. Create a webpage with your name as the URL. Post your resume and some pics. Link to your LinkedIn account. Record some intro vids and post on your website and LinkedIN.Make yourself visible and easy to find. Make what they find to be in alignment with what the employer wants to see.Create intro videos and mail/email them to your target audience. Send links to your stuff in emails. In your videos, answer your target audience's questions before they ask them.Get business cards made for networking. On the card create a QR code that will lead to your intro video or your website.The advantage of using your own website is you can monitor traffic and see who is checking you out.Find out the format of your target employer's email. Typically it is something like jsmith@bigcompany.com Then find out which managers really do the hiring, not HR. Email them directly AFTER you submitted a resume through HR. This will get you on the radar of the manager. Answer his questions in the video/email. Why should he hire you? What problem can you solve for him?When you interview do your research in advance. Know everything you can about that business before the interview. Bring your research with you to the interview and share it.Good luck.http://jobs-4-me.com/get-a-job/http://jobs-4-me.com/get-a-job-part-deux/Last edited: Sep 4, 2016Vinurco.comGB Conversions & AdventuresMaker Garage 101ReplyReactions: MrShah, splok, Get Right and 1 other personSep 6, 2016#15LibertyForMeHabits pave the path to success.Read Millionaire FastlaneSpeedway PassFeb 5, 20138091,455441Cincinnati, OHFirst, know exactly what it is you want to do. Most people don't even really know what they want. Once you know that, you can work backwards into what types of companies those positions might exist at.Your strategy will change depending on the type of position and also the seniority level of the position. It is pretty easy to get in the door at most places for an entry level position - it is more about your personality than your experience. Once you start moving up you need to change your strategy.​ReplyReactions: WrongWeasleySep 9, 2016Thread starter#16SinghContributorRead Millionaire FastlaneSpeedway PassFeb 27, 20168694136UKThanks for your input guys, I am in the process of implementing your ideas.

In the last year I had landed myself jobs at two high profile startups (both sucked, more on that at another time) and two other positions for good companies. I have been doing a lot of job jumping, probably too much. But I'm still able to land jobs somehow.Most people will tell you that job boards don't work. Here's my advice.- There are many ways to find a job. I don't have any advice about networking. I suck at it. I use job boards and websites.- Treat the job search like a marketer.- Create a Google sheet. Track every single job that you apply to. Write down the name of each job, notes, dates, and status.- Track conversion rates. For example, I know that with my style of applying to jobs 1 in every 4 applications will lead to a phone screen (statistically playing out in the long run). Then I know that 66% of all interviews turn into an offer for me. This is from about one year of stats. I can't say that it will always work out so well for me. There are many factors that influence this obviously.- Write different resumes and split test everything from style to the copy on the resume. My highest preforming resumes listed skills first. That surprised me.- If you have the time, add exact words from the job description to the body of resume (assuming that you truly do have the skills/experience). It takes less than 60 seconds.- Adding a cover letter resulted in an 87% response rate from recruiters.- A cover letter can be as simple as writing a 3 sentence paragraph followed by 7 bullet points about why you are fit for the job, then a closing statement. That worked like a charm for me and can easily be duplicated for other jobs.- Job Boards - I personally avoided monster and simplyhired. LinkedIn was decent, but there seemed to be a ton of competition. I really had a ton of success with Indeed. With Indeed, I had most success with applying to Indeed jobs where you could apply directly through Indeed, rather than the listed jobs that take you outside of Indeed.- I had terrible results when applying directly through a company application system that lives on their site. I have heard that these bulky systems are designed to filter our resumes by looking at keywords. So you really need to focus on using keywords if applying through systems like that.- RSS feeds - This saved me a lot of time. Setup RSS feeds. I used Google then sent feeds into a Slack channel. This way I had Slack constantly sourcing new jobs for me. That's how I landed my most recent job actually. Slack found the job while I was making dinner. I applied. Then 1 day later I interviewed and was offered the job.- Look at places where employers have to pay for the job posting. They obviously want a return.- I found it good to source at night/afternoon, apply in morning.- I found it also helps to have a portfolio to provide as a secondary source of information about you.\"Stay hungry, stay foolish.\" - Steve JobsReplyReactions: Gray Blimp, Arun Siva and RunumSep 11, 2016#20Arun Sivaaspiring 大君 of the bourgeoisieRead Millionaire FastlaneI've Read UNSCRIPTEDSummit AttendeeSpeedway PassAug 31, 20161,1952,027568NORD-TRONDELAGThiago Machado said:Check this out - http://beebom.com/most-creative-resumes/P.S. - Love the chocolate box.Click to expand...this is interesting thank you sirhttps://smythebates.com/Your Definitive Guides to Manufacturing & Quality Control https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/co...merce-sourcers-and-inventors-must-know.81006/https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/community/threads/commercialization-and-how-to-design-for-it.83586/​ReplySep 11, 2016#21Arun Sivaaspiring 大君 of the bourgeoisieRead Millionaire FastlaneI've Read UNSCRIPTEDSummit AttendeeSpeedway PassAug 31, 20161,1952,027568NORD-TRONDELAGjohnp said:This really isn't an unconventional way, but I do have some unconventional tips such as using Slack to find jobs.I got really good at this.

Benefit being that I am leaving my company is that I can be more out in the open about my job searchfollowing this thread the actions i took were as follows: maxed out my LinkedIn profile and CV/Resume with the aid of a professional writer, cold emailed potential companies I would like to work for, started to mail out letters with details of myself and the benefits I can bring to the companies directly to the department manager or CEO if its a small company of less then say 25 employees following Andy Blacks videos, contacted old friends and university teachers for assistance/ internal jobs, applied for lower position jobs and tried to impress at the interview in hope of a better job.Being honest things I didnt do but will immediately after submitting this post: Set up RSS Feeds as @johnp mentionedI feel as though I have done what I could but know there are better ways about this, if some members can perhaps share some ideas with me of what I could do I would be grateful. Likewise if there are any members who would like help with how I went about doing what i stated above then feel free to ask.ThanksClick to expand...Get the domain in your name., example jonsmith.com or jon.smith.com.

I recently got hired to teach at another school. The admin that hired me said she had to hire me because I was wearing an Hawaiian shirt. I had the credentials just like my 2 opponents did. I did something different to be remembered and that was the edge.Last edited: Jan 3, 2017Vinurco.comGB Conversions & AdventuresMaker Garage 101ReplyReactions: Bigguns50, MJ DeMarco, Singh and 2 othersJan 3, 2017#27Jon LPlatinum ContributorFASTLANE INSIDERRead Millionaire FastlaneSpeedway PassAug 22, 20151,5734,1041,016Bellevue, WAHere's one that I'm surprised no one has mentioned yet:Show up. Unannounced. In person. Resume in hand.I haven't looked for work in quite a while, but I was out of work for a bit, and as soon as I switched to that method of looking, I had two job offers. I probably went to 10 or 15 different companies. A few didn't take walk-ins. Most took my resume. The two that offered me jobs both gave me an interview right there. At one, the HR lady called up the hiring manager and said, 'i have this candidate for you that looks good, do you have some time for an interview now?' The other, the owner was there and interviewed me on the spot.The reason this works is that NO ONE does this anymore, so you stand out by default.ReplyReactions: MJ DeMarco, Singh, OldFaithful and 1 other personJan 6, 2017Thread starter#28SinghContributorRead Millionaire FastlaneSpeedway PassFeb 27, 20168694136UKThanks @Runum , I think a website will be great idea, especially in the modern world where an online prescence in itself can mean so much. Hey I Think the hawaiian shirts are great will certainly say I will never ever forget your videos because of them!@Jon L Wow thats definately a brave decision, I will try it recruitement agencies first to improve my technique then start moving onto companies directly. However as now strangely I have had two interviews already using the rubbish conventional approach which is Ironic. They are both short term contract roles so in the background will keep looking for other roles using your method once I approach the end of them if im successful in the next round of interviews.\"In nooks all over the earth sit men who are waiting, scarcely knowing in what way they are waiting, much less that they are waiting in vain.
