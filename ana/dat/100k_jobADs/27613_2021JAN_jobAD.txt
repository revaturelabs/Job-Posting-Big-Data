He now confides that there was a lot to learn about the mayor’s office.“I don’t think I knew what to expect, remember, I’d been out of political life a few years,” says the former federal cabinet minister.ON HOMELESSNESSSitting down for an expansive interview with CTV News, Holder is asked about the dozens of Londoners still living in tents on the eve of winter.“This is not a police state. We can’t say you have to go inside. As it gets colder more people will go inside. They’ll couch surf or whatever it might be,” he says.Holder adds that his team and civic administration have been “very committed” to London’s most vulnerable residents, pointing to new provincial funding for a permanent supervised drug consumption site at 446 York St.“I think this city has done a stellar job, frankly, and with the support agencies that work with us.”ON TRANSPORTATIONJust ten months ago, before the pandemic, Holder set a goal for London to become the first major city with a zero-emission bus fleet.The pandemic has caused ridership to plummet by 50 per cent, however, and a new report to the London Transit Commission details the costs and complexities.He is now considering more conservative timelines.“If ultimately it works out that we are not first, but second, I’m alright with that. As long as we get there,” admits Holder. “The key is don’t lose sight of the goal, you put the plan in place, and you challenge people to get to that place.”In 2018, Holder campaigned on the need for better bus service to industrial areas to ensure Londoners can connect with jobs.“It’s a bit of a chicken and egg. If you don’t have the routes, you don’t have the riders. If you don’t have the riders, how do you justify the routes?”He says the private sector businesses that will benefit from the routes will be asked to contribute.“Clearly industry is clamoring for this, and we’ll be looking to them for some additional support.”After resolving the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) debate with three-route political compromise, the mayor reveals he’ll soon unveil options to utilize the remaining transit funding from senior governments.“It’s time limited, so one of the things we need to do with the rapid transit projects is to put some project ideas in front of council which we intend to do in our third year.”ON JOBSThe mayor teases some big job announcements are on the horizon— and hope that the city’s economic recovery from the pandemic will accelerate.Holder telling CTV News, “There are going to be some major announcements coming forward in the coming months. Big openings I’m optimistic about even during the COVID crisis.”And regarding Holder’s employment future, will he seek re-election in 2022?The mayor replies, he wants to remain focused on his priorities entering year three, but, “Could I imagine myself running? Absolutely, but let’s have that discussion next year.”RELATED IMAGESview larger imageRelated StoriesPay-per-view: Why the State of the City Address won’t be live-streamed for freeLong road to electrifying LTC bus fleet detailed in new reportLondon falling short when it comes to household income, says reportSHAREReport Error Editorial standards and policies Why you can trust CTV NewsWatch More from CTV NewsfalseTrudeau assures Canadians Pfizer doses on the wayAir Date: January 22, 2021falsePolice search for suspect in city's third homicideAir Date: January 24, 2021falseBack to class for some students, MondayAir Date: January 24, 2021falseThis bundled-up Bernie meme has the entire internet talkingfalseWinner of US$731M Powerball may choose to remain a mysteryfalseLondon teen passes away from covid-19Air Date: January 24, 2021London Top StoriesSarnia Police searching for suspect in city’s third homicide of 2021.Church of God Pastor invites large group of maskless parishioners inside churchCOVID-19 outbreak declared at Piero's Pizza after four staff members test positiveMan falls through ice in northwest London'It wasn't called COVID at the time': One year since Canada's first COVID-19 caseBiden vows to work with Canada on 'Buy American' policy, but offers no guaranteesEditor's Picks'Hugs for the Homes' brings encouraging words to Huron County long-term care staffUnique local community desperate to slow speeders'These animals are getting desperate': Pandemic affects animals reliant on humans for foodAround OntariofalseOttawa: Father misses birth of son due to hospital COVID-19 protocolsAir Date: January 22, 2021falseSimcoe Muskoka: Roberta Place staff ‘quite scared’Air Date: January 22, 2021falseLondon: Survivor of building collapse shares storyAir Date: January 22, 2021falseToronto: Teen sweethearts open chocolate businessAir Date: January 22, 2021falseFrench River: Online school app hackedAir Date: January 22, 2021falseWindsor: Ontario enforcement blitz comingAir Date: January 22, 2021DON'T MISSfalseToronto Maple Leafs legend George Armstrong dead at 90falseIndigenous woman uses TikTok to keep her culture alivefalseDramatic bodycam footage of woman and dog saved from iceCTVNews.ca Top StoriesMexico's president says he's tested positive for COVID-19Too soon to know if Canada's COVID-19 case decline will continue, Tam saysWhite House begins talks with lawmakers on COVID-19 reliefPolice in Jamaica probe murder of Markham, Ont. womanAP source: Lawmakers threatened ahead of impeachment trialBiden to impose South Africa travel ban to combat new COVID-19 variant: U.S. CDCAdvertisementMost-WatchedfalseLondon teen passes away from covid-19Air Date: January 24, 2021falseResidents pulled from outbreak-hit LTC homeAir Date: January 20, 2021falseLondon, Ont. pencil artist catches eye of NHLAir Date: January 22, 2021falseCTV National News: Bernier Sanders meme goes viralAir Date: January 21, 2021falseDog waits days for its owner outside hospitalAir Date: January 22, 2021Most-ReadLondon, Ont. teen is region's youngest COVID-19 deathChurch of God Pastor invites large group of maskless parishioners inside churchOPP investigating fatal collision in Norfolk, Sunday afternoonSarnia Police searching for suspect in city’s third homicide of 2021.Man falls through ice in northwest LondonPolitical Ads RegistryUse of this Website assumes acceptance of Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy© 2021 All rights reserved.Back to top"
