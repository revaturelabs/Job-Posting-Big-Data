A $50 donation will be requested to register businesses and will be used to cover costs of the event and help support Veteran causes.“Our Veterans bring characteristics that are highly sought by business,” said NMC Military and Veteran Services coordinator, Scott Herzberg. “These men and women have worked for the largest value-based employer in the world, the US Military; they bring a combination of hard and soft skill sets, making them an ideal candidate and an asset to any organization.” Herzberg adds that “Veterans have a strong reputation of being dependable, motivated, well-rounded contributors that embody strong leadership skills.”Available jobs will be posted online next to the participating businesses so Veterans are aware of what is available. The Jobs for Vets Hiring Fair not only targets men and women who have just left military service, but also Veterans who are looking to find better jobs, along with their spouses. The event is free to Veterans and their spouses and more information, along with registration can be found at JobsForVetsMI.com.Jobs for Vets is organized by Northwestern Michigan College Veterans Services office, Northwest Michigan Works!, Bill Marsh Auto Group, and Northern Michigan for Veterans.
