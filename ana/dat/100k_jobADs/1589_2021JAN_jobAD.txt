Programmers, developers, hardware technicians, project managers, help desk workers and the managers overseeing the individual elements of the project all add up to a significant portion of a company’s workforce, and they need to be led strategically by someone on the board whose responsibility is solely with them. That person is the IT director.The IT director creates an IT strategy from the board’s overarching strategy and projections, and works closely with his or her immediate IT managers to ensure the project is delivered. As a board member, he or she may have some access to the company purse to ensure complex IT projects are adequately resourced, but keeping a lid on costs is always a key responsibility; IT budgets spiralling out of control is a common story in business and the public sector.The skills requiredAt board level, an IT director could have little experience in dealing with information technology, but will build a team of managers to oversee the work. However, if you have experience of managing IT projects to a senior level, you could be the ideal candidate for many companies whose boards rely on the IT director’s expertise and counsel to inform them of the opportunities and limitations of the technology.Primarily, your job as IT director is to oversee the delivery of either single IT projects or an ongoing series of projects as designated by the board, and your success will be judged on your performance in delivering projects on time and on budget. This can be a highly responsible job, often at the cutting edge of technology, and managing budgets can be difficult. However, with successful implementation, the rewards can be great.Find IT Director Jobs with Cast UKCast UK only recruits at managerial and director level, and because we recruit only in a small range of sectors, we can offer a specialized service to clients looking for IT directors.

It is known as being one of the most profitable locations to base a business, meaning there are many opportunities for those seeking IT Director roles.People have been living in this area for thousands of years - and the easily navigable river meant that there was a thriving trade with the Mediterranean as far back as 250 BC.During the Middle Ages, Exeter had one of the largest markets in the south-west and it was also known for its annual fairs, which continued until the 16th century.At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, Exeter's industry was mainly based on agricultural products. Water power was used to some degree, but the city was too far from a source of coal to make the most of steam power.The development of the canal network did, however, help to boost Exeter's prominence, and the Bristol and Exeter Railway opened in 1844, further building the local economy.Today, Exeter is a bustling city with plenty of retail space, particularly in the Princesshay Shopping Centre. It is also home to a number of big employers, with a several companies employing 1,000 people or more - such as British Telecom, EDF and Flybe.In 2004, the Met Office relocated to Exeter and this organisation is now one of the largest employers in the region, along with Devon County Council and the University of Exeter. Other companies with a significant presence include Tesco, the Highways Agency and Alcoa Howmet.Cast UK - helping you search for fresh rolesIf you're ready to take your career to the next level with a new IT Director position, the team at Cast UK can help.With extensive experience in the procurement, logistics and supply chain fields, our specialists can provide the advice and assistance you need to find a vacancy that matches your skills and qualifications.To find out more about how Cast UK can help you find and recruit candidates within Exeter or source a new job in Exeter then contact one of our consultant team on 0333 121 3345.Interim Strategic Construction BuyerEnglandNegotiableLeading strategic sourcing and category management activities ranging from supplier management to strategic project support and program implementation with local supply base and supporting local Branch / Regional business activitiesResponsibilities i...Inventory SupervisorWellingborough, NorthamptonshireUp to £25000.00 per annumMy client is a global distribution business who are looking to recruit a high calibre inventory supervisor for their operation based in Northamptonshire.Head of OperationsLondonNegotiableead of OperationsCentral LondonExecutive Package Cast UK are exclusively partnering a rapidly growing international organization as they look for their UK Head of Operations, based in Central London.Service EngineerBasildon, EssexNegotiablePart of the Engineering Team, your role is responsible for the timely repairs, maintenance & servicing of the business's welfare units.Transport ManagerBristolNegotiableBunzl Catering Supplies, part of the Bunzl Catering & Hospitality Division, is the leading distributor of disposables, packaging and hygiene solutions to the hospitality and catering sectors in the UK.Material PlannerChester, CheshireNegotiableIfor Williams Trailers (IWT) is Britain's leading trailer manufacturer, operating at four advanced manufacturing sites across North Wales.Demand Planner (SAP)Stockport, Greater Manchester£26000 - £28000 per annum + Excellent BenefitsOur client is a manufacturing business in Stockport looking to recruit a Demand Planner into the team.Material Planner / BuyerBirmingham, West Midlands£25000.00 - £30000 per annum + BenefitsCast UK are looking to recruit a Material Planner / Buyer role for an expanding component sourcing and distribution business supplying Automotive and Aerospace clients nationwide.Warehouse Team LeaderGreater Manchester£22500.00 - £25000.00 per annum + BenefitsOur client, who is a market leading business, are looking to recruit a Warehouse Team Leader to join their well-established team based in Greater Manchester.Interim HR DirectorLancashire£375 - £400 per dayA high-growth and dynamic business based in Lancashire is looking to recruit an Interim HR Director, ideally for an immediate start.Supply Chain ManagerHalifax, West Yorkshire£40000.00 - £50000.00 per annumA highly successful and up and coming business is looking for an experienced Supply Chain Manager to join their team.Assistant BuyerBarnsley, South Yorkshire£22500.00 - £24000.00 per annumCast UK are recruiting an Assistant Buyer position for an established FMCG business based in the Barnsley area.Head of ECommerceBristol£50000 - £60000 per annumCast UK is partnering exclusively with our eCommerce client to recruit a Head of eCommerce.Head of ECommerceLondon£50000 - £60000 per annumCast UK is partnering exclusively with our eCommerce client to recruit a Head of eCommerce.FeaturedNational Heath & Safety ManagerBanbury, OxfordshireNegotiablePart of the Health & Safety Team, your role is responsible for Quality, Safety, Health & Environmental systems for a fast-paced Food Distribution business ensuring there is no compromises to Health & Safety.Previous NextView all jobsRelated IT Director jobs in ExeterImplementation LeadBusiness Transformation ManagerHead of Business ImprovementPMO ManagerHead of Continuous ImprovementPopular Cities & TownsTorquayBristolWeston-super-MareBathPooleView all cities & townsPopular CountiesWiltshireHampshireGloucestershireDorsetSomersetView all countiesPopular RegionsWalesScotlandWest MidlandsSouth WestNorth WestView all regionsWe're here to helpLondon0208 185 5200Manchester0161 825 0825Birmingham0121 222 6444Please note that all telephone calls are recorded for training & monitoring purposeshello@castuk.comCast UK7 Jordan Street, Manchester, M15 4PY0161 825 0825enquiries@castuk.comJobsBusiness Change & TransformationHuman ResourcesProcurement & PurchasingBuying & MerchandisingSupply ChainLogistics & TransportWarehouse & DistributionOtherServicesInterim RecruitmentPermanent RecruitmentFixed Term & Contract RecruitmentExecutive SearchNED RecruitmentSectorsFMCGRetailManufacturingEngineeringDefencePharmaceuticalsChemicalsLogisticsAutomotiveAerospacePublic SectorProfessional ServicesPrivacy Notice© Cast UK Ltd 2021.
