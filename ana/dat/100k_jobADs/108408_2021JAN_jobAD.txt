Hubenak played some in the first half before departing the scrimmage with flu-like symptoms, Sumlin said after the scrimmage.A&M needed immediate help at quarterback after Kyler Murray and Kyle Allen both transferred before the Music City Bowl in December.Hubenak started one game last season after Allen and Murray weren't able to get the struggling Aggies offense going.Knight transferred after losing Oklahoma's starting job to Baker Mayfield last season.In 2014, Knight went 179 of 316 for 2,300 yards in 10 games for the Sooners, completing 56.6 percent of his passes and throwing for 14 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He rushed for 339 yards and five touchdowns that season.Most PopularElon Musk Responds To a Request From a Tweeter Who Sent Him the Same Message 154 TimesAnnual passes are likely only the first of many things to go at DisneylandSuper Spurs fan takes his Crocs up a notchFBI arrests San Antonio man allegedly at Capitol riotsStores drop MyPillow after CEO pushes election conspiracies'You start to feel stupid': Tech workers can't leave SF fast enough'The Bachelor': The journey ended for one of the San Antonio womenHe started 15 games for the Sooners at quarterback including two bowl games and was the 2014 Sugar Bowl MVP against Alabama.Tgriffin@express-news.netTwitter: @TimGriffinBig12Top Picks In ShoppingShopping 4 alternatives to The Mirror if you want more from your...Shopping How a virtual movie club has helped me survive the pandemicShopping I rode this Peloton competitor for 21 days.
