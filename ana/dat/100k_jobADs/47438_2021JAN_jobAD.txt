Great job!For cables, you can use toilet paper/paper towel holders to stick up under your desk until the ones you want are in stock.I got all of my blankets, quilts, sheets, etc. bagged up in blanket bags and arranged neatly on my closet shelf instead of just crammed in wherever they would somewhat fit. Today I did some organizing on the next shelf down. I really need to do the whole closet, but those shelves are a good start and I was able to get some things off the floor because I couldn't fit them on a shelf anywhere. I also decluttered two electric blankets that were no longer working that I intended to recycle and use as regular blankets, but then asked myself if I would ever really get to doing it.

I've gotten it sorted out now and the only thing left is to make the file folders I need for what I want to keep and get those filed in my file box, which shouldn't take too long! Then my daily task for today will be completed!I also ordered a couple of hanging cloth shelves to go in my closet and plan to fold some of the things I currently have on hangers and it should free up a lot of space in there.I've thought about doing the closet the Kondo way in which I take out everything at once, but I have a feeling that if I ever did that, I'd end up sleeping on that pile for the next few days.So I'm planning to get it done piece by piece as part of my dailies. I seem to do better with smaller steps and get too overwhelmed when I have too much at once.RebeccaSWITCH: 5336-9860-3217“We should be rigorous in judging ourselves and gracious in judging others.” ― John WesleybekkilynPosted: August 28, 3:00 AMPermalinkI'm S.P.E.C.I.A.L.#giraffewatch 2017 USAToday was something else!So the daily task for today was to pick up the rest of the things on the floor of the \"office\" room and put them away. Well in the process, I accidentally turned off the UPS for my desktop and cable modem and router, etc. I've had this small printer stand sitting around for months with the intention of using it under my desk to hold the UPS, modem, etc. but had been procrastinating because I knew it was going to be a real pain getting all those things extracted from the beat-up plastic milk crate I'd been using that has been sagging and put onto the printer stand.So I decided that since everything was already turned off that I would forge ahead and get it done! It really was a pain. I used wire cutters to take apart the milk crate since I didn't really want to unplug *everything* to get it out. A couple cables did come unplugged, but I managed to extract the crate, vacuum the area, and get the printer stand under the desk along with everything else, found where everything needed to be connected and miraculously it all worked when I was done! (I seem to often have the misfortune of deciding to do things like this at the same time the internet decides to go down and then I spend lots of time trying to figure out why things aren't working, thinking the whole time that it's me. Glad this was not one of those times!)Yay!But it sure was an ordeal!RebeccaSWITCH: 5336-9860-3217“We should be rigorous in judging ourselves and gracious in judging others.” ― John WesleytuffalobuffaloPosted: August 28, 6:05 AMPermalinkI'm game!OregonMy partner is selling her house, and we have been purging. So many things donated. An ultimate dump run will happen when we vacate, but it won't be too much. The weirdest thing to purge was my dad and my SCUBA equipment. All about 8-15 years old. 3 bins worth. The money spent on it was several thousands of dollars. We got our money's worth out of it for sure. It's an expensive hobby, and I probably won't be getting back into it ever, and if I did, I'd just buy new equipment. SCUBA equipment degrades and loses value extremely quickly.So, dropped the 3 bins at a local dive shop for them to salvage or destroy.

The chair is long past it's prime and while it was the most comfortable desk chair I'd ever used, it doesn't seem to be very helpful to my posture and it's a bit broken in places, so I think it needs to be put out to pasture so to speak.Which leaves room for the floor lounger I plan to set up next to my bookcases and have a bit of a reading nook there. Today's goal is to vacuum that area and get everything clean and get that set up. One of next week's goals will probably be to try to dismantle the chair to get it out a lot easier, probably before Wednesday since that's when trash and recycling is collected.RebeccaSWITCH: 5336-9860-3217“We should be rigorous in judging ourselves and gracious in judging others.” ― John WesleyLeapingGnomePosted: September 4, 5:38 PMPermalinkForum OrnamentColumbusbobbywatson wrote:Things have slowed down somewhat in the past week or two.

Even though it has its advantages over physical clutter, it's still something that can get out of hand and cause stress, so even digital clutter needs to be managed.

But it's all too tempting to just let go and use search as a crutch... and that's not good either. I've also been using a mix of Dropbox, Google Drive, local storage and OneDrive over the years so sometimes I lose track of where to find that specific photo or document. I've been 'decluttering' towards OneDrive lately.Today I've been reorganizing the plastic map holding thing (no idea what it's called) that holds our tax/house/car/travel papers, and threw out a lot of old paperwork.

I made the mistake to make the goal too vague, as in \"Clear up the rest of the clutter on the living room floor.\" It sounded simple at the time because I don't have a lot of things on the floor, but what's remaining is a bit tricky and so it's been taking a lot more than one day to do, which also mentally dampened my motivation for that goal. So that goal remains undone even though I've made progress on it.The lesson to be learned here is to not make vague goals. If I'm decluttering anything, I need to be very specific. Rather than saying \"the rest of the clutter on the floor\" I need to instead say exactly which clutter I'll be removing, i.e. \"clean and put away the outdoor tools lying near the door.\"I have been completing other daily goals since that flop of a goal, but it's still one that I haven't been able to check off as completed.

My place has been a mess (outside of the small part of my office).I ordered some cable organizers from Ikea. I was supposed to pick them up last night, but I never got the confirmation email that they were ready for pick up, and now I'm not sure what to do. I might end up calling them later today to see what's up. (Order status says 'Order received', nothing else.)Surprisingly, my Futurama DVD sets sold in a manner of hours, and the person who bought them was exactly on time, which was pretty amazing. I also managed to sell my DS Lite. This weekend, I should be able to list my Dreamcast accessories (2 controllers and 3 memory cards). No idea if they will sell. I also have a bunch of video games ready to be listed as well.I got rid of all my PS1, PS2 and Dreamcast games earlier this year. I'm currently working on selling the Wii and GBA games. PSP games are next. Funnily enough, I sold both my PSP-1000 and my PSP-3000 earlier this year, and I only have a PSP Go remaining, which I cannot use to play games on UMD. Good thing I ripped everything a long time ago.One thing that I did not realize at first is how stressful listing stuff on Kijiji/Craigslist can be. I find it somewhat tough to manage me going out (for walks or errands) and trying to figure out when someone will come to pick something up.Currently playing: The Legend of Heroes: Trails From Zero (PC), Assassin's Creed III (PC)bekkilynPosted: September 11, 5:43 PMPermalinkI'm S.P.E.C.I.A.L.#giraffewatch 2017 USAdejanzie wrote:Yesterday I emptied the cutlery shelf, vacuumed and cleaned it.But Wednesday had a bit more oomph to it.

I was thinking of using it before steaming, but I hadn't used it in so long that the foam \"mop\" part was falling apart, so out it goes. I have two pads for the steamer mop, so once I've done the entire floor with the one pad, I'll do it all over again with the clean one and then both will go into the wash!Last night I also put together a dish drying rack that goes over the sink, so I have cleared off some counter space where I had a regular drying rack.
