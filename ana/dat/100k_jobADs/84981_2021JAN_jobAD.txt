It also benefits team members by allowing them to understand themselves and their relationships with others.The style and format of psychometric tests are designed to ensure they cannot be manipulated and are extremely useful to assess certain types of “hidden”, less obvious attributes as well as what truly motivates a person to succeed.However these tests are not designed to only benefit prospective employers. The benefits of testing for job seekers include:It provides a level playing field and chance to show what you are really good at;Helps you find a job you’ll love and allows you to avoid jobs that will make you unhappy;Allows you to gain a real insight into your strengths, weakness, motivators and preferred working styles so you’ll make informed decisions about your work and life;Helps you develop your career; andServes as an opportunity for less confident individuals to really shine.There are never right or wrong answers as psychometric results compare your ability levels to a ‘normal’ expectation for a demographic group chosen by the employer or test provider.Regardless of which part of the recruitment process a psychometric test is incorporated, it should always be considered as just one aspect – and not the decision making tool.When utilised properly, psychometric testing should be used as a means of confirming what prospective employers already suspect … that they have in fact found the right candidate for the job – and that a candidate has found a job that is truly right for them.What are your thoughts on psychometric testing?Share on Facebook Share0Share on TwitterTweet0Share on Pinterest Share0Share on LinkedIn SharePrint Print0Total SharesTags:Post navigation← To Apply or Not to Apply?Biography Is Not Destiny →Job FinderKeywordsCategoryAll Categories ITLocationAll Locations Abbotsford ACT Adelaide Adelaide CBD Alexandria Artarmon Ashfield Auckland Australian Capital Territory Balcatta Ballarat Balwyn Banksia Bankstown Barangaroo Barton Beaconsfield Beaconsfield, New South Wales Bella Vista Bellevue Hill Belrose Beverley Park Blacktown Bondi Bondi Junction Botany Brisbane Brisbane CBD Brisbane CBD, Queensland Brisbane, Queensland Brookvale Brunswick Burwood Burwood, New South Wales Canberra Canberra CBD Canberra CBD, Australian Capital Territory Canberra, Australian Capital Territory Canterbury Carlton Castle Hill CBD Chatswood Chatswood, New South Wales Chippendale Coffs Harbour Concord West Cremorne Cronulla Dandenong Dandenong South Darling Point Darlinghurst Darwin Dee Why Docklands Double Bay Drummoyne Dry Creek Eastern Suburbs Melbourne Eastern Suburbs Sydney Edgecliff Eight Mile Plains Eveleigh Fairfield Fitzroy Footscray Forestville Geelong Gladesville Glebe Gold Coast Gosford Granville, New South Wales Greenacre Hartwell, Victoria Hawthorn Haymarket Homebush Hornsby Huntingwood Hurstville Innaloo Inner Suburbs Melbourne Inner Suburbs Sydney Inner West Inner West Sydney Kensington Killarney Heights Kings Cross Kingswood Lane Cove Lane Cove West Lane Cove, New South Wales Lavender Bay Leichhardt Leichhardt, New South Wales Lidcombe Linley Point Lismore Liverpool Lower North Shores Macquarie Park Macquarie Park, New South Wales Maitland Marrickville Mascot Mascot, New South Wales Matraville McMahons Point McMahons Point, New South Wales Meadowbank Melbourne Melbourne CBD Melbourne CBD, Victoria Melbourne, Victoria Mentone Milsons Point Miranda Mornington Mortlake Mossman Neutral Bay New South Wales Newcastle Newtown North Ryde North Shore North Sydney North Sydney & More North Sydney, New South Wales Northbridge Northen Beaches / North Shore Northern Beaches Northern Sydney Northern Territory NSW NSW Other Oceania > Australia > New S.
