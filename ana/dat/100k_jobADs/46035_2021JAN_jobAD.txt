These two new audience and content editor roles are to fill the vacancies created by recent resignations from the Company.“They are not replacing any of the roles made redundant – and at the time, we were of course unaware of these resignations. These two new exciting roles have been introduced already at several of our titles and really encapsulate the skills required in the modern multimedia newsroom.“We are happy to welcome applications from past and present staff and while we are sorry to see employees leave the business – we look forward to building an exciting new team around the new editor Pete Gavan.”The NUJ disputed the claims made by Granville regarding the news roles.A spokesperson said: “For many years now the Swindon Advertiser has only had two members of staff working on the news desk – a news editor and an assistant news editor.“The news editor was made redundant in December 2017, leaving only the assistant news editor, who did indeed resign last week.“For Toby Granville to say that both roles have arisen as a result of resignations is simply wrong. Toby’s justification for this new role is nothing if not a work of absolute fiction.”A spokesperson for Newsquest responding to the fresh claims said: “The NUJ claims are nonsense. There are other people in the Swindon management team besides the assistant news editor.“One of them – despite being offered the newly-created audience and content editor role – has told us they are leaving.“Therefore we are looking for two audience and content editors to work directly for the new editor.“These are two brand new management roles which require a completely different skillset to the traditional news desk role – and once they are appointed the headcount at Swindon would not have changed as a consequence.”Picture: NUJSIGN UP HERE FORMEDIA MONITORPress Gazette's weekly email providing strategic insight into the future of the mediaSubscribeRelated StoriesRegional ABCs: Only 13 out of 373 paid-for weeklies put on circulation year on yearRegional ABCs: Paid-for local press circulation drops by 6.4 per centABCs: 26 per cent of free weeklies increase circulation18 per cent of free newspapers see increased circulationExplore these topicsNewsquestNUJComments1 thought on “NUJ claims staff at Swindon Advertiser left 'confused and angry' after newsdesk job adverts follow redundancies”tom says:	March 16, 2018 at 12:24 pm	It is a disgraceful news (not that you can call it news) publication that incites hatred and false reporting for the sole benefit of its shareholders. Not that I am sorry to see the reporters leave as they were complicit in the false and biased reporting to invoke a reaction from the poorly educated news readers of Swindon. The word Karma springs to mind.ReplyLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
