What are you going to do?Well, I’m not going to work.Well, you have to get a job. Everyone needs a job.I don’t need to get a job.Well then, how are you going to pay your bills?I’m just going to go to the poor box, you know at the Jewel, over by the Target? There’s a box where you put money. I’m going to saw a hole in the bottom of the box and attach a plastic bag. Then I’m going to grab the bag and get the money and that’s how I’m going to pay the bills.Sweetie, you can’t get money that way. You need to work for your money.I’m not going to do anything for work, so how can you be asking me that question.You are writing what I’m saying.No I’m notYes you areHow do you know? You can’t read.That first thing started with an I. I saw you write an I and I said an I.Fine. How are you going to pay your bills when you grow up?I’m not going to pay any bills because I won’t be working.You have to pay bills or you can’t live.I don’t care because I’m not going to pay my bills, I just don’t want to. I’M NOT NOT NOT GOING TO PAY MY BILLS!What if they turn off your electricity?I’ll use candles.What if you run out of candles?I’ll get moreHow will you get more if you can’t pay for them?Well First.

Are you telling me that the “argue my mom into the ground” phase doesn’t end at 4? Nnnnnooooooooooo!!!!!!!Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 19, 2013 at 9:09 am	LOL! Jean, I don’t think that will ever end!Reply	Linda RoyJuly 19, 2013 at 9:12 am	He sounds like me. Join a rock band kiddo. You’ll be working your butt off, without feeling like you have a job. The only problem is…you’ll still need money! haha! So cute! And…don’t you just love when they bust us for writing about them?Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 19, 2013 at 9:53 pm	It’ll either be a rock band, the presidency or a comedian Linda!Reply	ConsidererJuly 19, 2013 at 9:15 am	You were never going to win that one if you’d talked him ten ways to next week!Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 19, 2013 at 9:53 pm	Lizzi ~ I never win any of them!Reply	CrystalJuly 19, 2013 at 10:40 am	That’s so cute. But I wish it was as simple as that for real…..Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 19, 2013 at 9:53 pm	Tell me about it Crystal!Reply	Kristi CampbellJuly 19, 2013 at 12:00 pm	OMG Jen! Laughed out loud (not just an LOL – a real laugh) at the end! I love it and hurray that he can read! Ha!PS – when he figures out the whole no job thing, please share his non-illegal secrets with the rest of us?Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 19, 2013 at 9:54 pm	Thanks Kristi! I really was writing it as he was saying it, I was proud of how fast I could type! And when he figures out how to print money, you’ll be the first to know!Reply	Julie SparksJuly 19, 2013 at 12:12 pm	OMG, this sounds like a conversation with my 18 yo! lol And to Jean, circular conversations last the whole life of an autistic kid!Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 19, 2013 at 9:54 pm	Oh Julie! Do I know I have a long road ahead of me!Reply	KatiaJuly 19, 2013 at 2:16 pm	I absolutely love your child and love this post! I could imagine that conversation happening between Ben and I. Yes, Isaiah definitely reminds me so much of him. What a bright kid, what a character! This post is adorable.Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 19, 2013 at 9:54 pm	How awesome would it be to get our boys together Katia!Reply	JessicaJuly 19, 2013 at 2:16 pm	Oh my word. That is hilarious! Hopefully he’ll just find something he really loves to do that pays money. Heck, I’d like to find that, too. 😉Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 19, 2013 at 9:55 pm	Tell me about it Jessica, then he could take care of me!Reply	KerriJuly 19, 2013 at 2:21 pm	You are a good mom for not pointing out that making lemonade would be considered work 🙂Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 19, 2013 at 9:55 pm	Kerri ~ He had a lemonade stand today, and made $2! He was so proud, and said he was off to buy a chocolate bar!Reply	ShayJuly 19, 2013 at 3:25 pm	I love how he said, “You’re writing this down, aren’t you?” My family asks me that all the time, but for a different reason: They love blog posts about them. So I have to hide it when I am writing it down, because if they happen to see it, they try to ham it up and make themselves sound funnier, and it’s just not “raw” anymore. This was adorable, Jen!Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 19, 2013 at 9:56 pm	If it wasn’t for him, Shay, I’d have nothing to write about!Reply	DanaJuly 19, 2013 at 4:28 pm	Love this! My kids are very suspicious of me writing stuff down to blog about later. And they can definitely read – and my daughter reads my blog. So I always get caught.Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 19, 2013 at 9:56 pm	I know Dana, if I pick up a pen around him he’s suspicious!Reply	Lisa NolanJuly 19, 2013 at 7:56 pm	He sounds like a prince! Princes don’t get jobs! And they get to become kings, usually! I guess he’ll change his mind when he wants a car, and a cell phone, and a computer, and a TV, and a dog, and, and, and, are you writing this down?! LOL!Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 19, 2013 at 9:57 pm	Lisa, I’m pretty sure if he could be a King he’d be all over that!Reply	Darcy PerduJuly 19, 2013 at 11:28 pm	So adorable! And I LOVE the photo of him asking for candles! What a perfect pose for that! I will send that darling boy candles for the rest of his life — don’t make him get a job, mama!Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 21, 2013 at 4:50 pm	Darcy, he’s had 2 lemonade stands in 2 days to prove me wrong?Reply	Lisa NewlinJuly 19, 2013 at 11:42 pm	In his defense, he seems to have it all figured out. Do you think you could ask him how to solve the Middle East crisis? I’d be interested to get his input.And next time record him talking on your phone. He’ll never know…Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 21, 2013 at 4:51 pm	Lisa he has his ideas, trust me. Thanks for the tip!Reply	Tamara WoodsJuly 20, 2013 at 12:48 am	That is hilarious! Hey, at least he’s got a plan. Candles and lemonade stand. Sounds legit. 😉Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 21, 2013 at 4:51 pm	Well it’s got to be legal, Tamara!Reply	Actually Mummy...July 20, 2013 at 4:57 am	Brilliant! Very enterprising too! I run a linky every Tuesday about exactly this kind of thing – pop over and link up if you fancyReply	Jennifer KehlJuly 21, 2013 at 4:52 pm	Thanks! I’ll link it up this week!Reply	Jenny @ The Brick CastleJuly 20, 2013 at 8:53 am	So making lemonade stands isn’t a job?….Perfect career then… 😀Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 21, 2013 at 4:52 pm	Well Jenny, I think he’s going to make it a career!Reply	Stephanie @ Mommy, for Real.July 20, 2013 at 3:15 pm	You are SO versatile! I love when you do funny! Those pictures were hilarious and perfect, and the candles bit cracked me up. I adore reading conversations between you and your kid. Such a great post!Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 21, 2013 at 4:52 pm	Thanks Stephanie! I like it too, it’s a nice break.Reply	SarahJuly 20, 2013 at 5:38 pm	Haha, I love this! Hilarious! I can’t wait till I have kids so I can write down everything they say too haha xxReply	Jennifer KehlJuly 21, 2013 at 4:53 pm	You have to be careful Sarah, he gets pretty worked up when he knows I’m taking notes!Reply	DianeJuly 21, 2013 at 8:20 am	Heehee! I had this exact conversation with my son – when he was nineteen. Sigh.Somehow this is lots . . . cuter. 🙂Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 21, 2013 at 4:53 pm	Oh Diane, I hope we won’t be doing that!Reply	RachelJuly 21, 2013 at 2:06 pm	Oh, this is so cute. I loved the pictures. Somehow, it reminded me of the shtick, “You must pay the rent”…”I can’t pay the rent”…”You must pay the rent”. But, you know, a lot of days, jobs aren’t all they’re cracked up to be. Can’t say I blame the guy. I think he’s wise beyond his years!Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 21, 2013 at 4:54 pm	Totally Rachel! I know just what you’re talking about! I’m figuring he could probably make it as a comedian 🙂Reply	KateJuly 22, 2013 at 10:37 am	Wish I could have been a fly on the wall for this one…. 🙂Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 22, 2013 at 5:28 pm	I’ve got lots of video Kate, I’m getting ready to post some!Reply	Rich RumpleJuly 22, 2013 at 8:59 pm	Kids are so cool. Life’s answers may be simple thoughts in their little minds, and they may be right at times! Now, where the Hell’s that box at Jewel over by Target? Well … it’s worth a shot, isn’t it?Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 22, 2013 at 9:23 pm	Dude, Rich – I don’t even know where the box is! I know where the Jewel is by the Target, but I’m still looking for the poor box!Reply	Kenya G. JohnsonJuly 22, 2013 at 9:01 pm	Lol! My son does that too, “Are you writing that down? Please don’t put that in Facebook!” Love how you illustrated his argument with photos.Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 22, 2013 at 9:20 pm	Thanks Kenya! It was easy, there’s so many pictures of him looking mad!Reply	A Pleasant HouseJuly 22, 2013 at 9:06 pm	I’m with your son- jobs are overrated and candles are an excellent source of light, after all, plenty of people burn money and THEY have jobs.Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 22, 2013 at 9:20 pm	I totally agree with you Cheryl, but I’m not telling the boy. Or else he’s going to say Cheryl said I don’t have to work mom!Reply	Melissa@Home on DerangedJuly 23, 2013 at 10:28 pm	I love this kid. Seriously. I would take him home with me and tell him he never has to get a job as long as he can continue to entertain me every day.Reply	Jennifer KehlJuly 24, 2013 at 7:01 am	Miss – He’d go since you live in Texas, so keep your mouth shut!Reply	JhanisJuly 24, 2013 at 4:23 am	He is soooo cute! Don’t force it momma, he is not going to pay his bills and that’s it LOLReply	Jennifer KehlJuly 24, 2013 at 7:02 am	I know Jhanis, I know!Reply	TerryeJuly 26, 2013 at 12:36 pm	He should think about being an employment consultant. 🙂Reply	Suzanne LucasJuly 29, 2013 at 12:50 pm	So what about those ATM’s that spit out money all the time? He can just do that, right?I love it how things just seem so simple when you’re a kid.Reply	Leave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
