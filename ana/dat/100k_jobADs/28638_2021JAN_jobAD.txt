Natural sciences managers have different requirements based on the size of their staff. Managers with larger staffs spend their time primarily in offices performing administrative duties and spend little time doing research or working in the field or in laboratories. Working managers who have research responsibilities and smaller staffs may need to work in laboratories or in the field, which may require traveling, sometimes to remote locations. Work Schedules Most natural sciences managers work full time. About 1 out of 3 worked more than 40 hours per week in 2016.Best paying jobs for Biological and Physical SciencesNumber of Jobs for Nutrition SciencesNumber of Jobs in 2018 was 56,700Education requiredBachelor's degreeJob Outlook for Nutrition SciencesEmployment of natural sciences managers is projected to grow 10 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations. Employment growth should be affected by many of the same factors that affect employment growth for the scientists whom these managers supervise.Job description of Nutrition SciencesNatural sciences managers supervise the work of scientists, including chemists, physicists, and biologists. They direct activities related to research and development, and coordinate activities such as testing, quality control, and production.DutiesNatural sciences managers typically do the following:Work with top executives to develop goals and strategies for researchers and developersBudget resources for projects and programs by determining staffing, training, and equipment needsHire, supervise, and evaluate scientists, technicians, and other staff membersReview staff members’ methodology and the accuracy of their research resultsMonitor the progress of projects, review research performed, and draft operational reportsEnsure that laboratories are stocked with equipment and suppliesProvide technical assistance to scientists, technicians, and support staffEstablish and follow administrative procedures, policies, and standardsCommunicate project proposals, research findings, and the status of projects to clients and top managementNatural sciences managers direct scientific research activities and direct and coordinate product development projects and production activities. The duties of natural sciences managers vary with the field of science (such as biology or chemistry) or the industry they work in. Research projects may be aimed at improving manufacturing processes, advancing basic scientific knowledge, or developing new products.Some natural sciences managers are former scientists and, after becoming managers, may continue to conduct their own research as well as oversee the work of others. These managers are sometimes called working managers and usually have smaller staffs, allowing them to do research in addition to carrying out their administrative duties.Managers who are responsible for larger staffs may not have time to contribute to research and may spend all their time performing administrative duties.Laboratory managers need to ensure that laboratories are fully supplied so that scientists can run their tests and experiments. Some specialize in the management of laboratory animals.During all stages of a project, natural sciences managers coordinate the activities of their unit with those of other units or organizations. They work with higher levels of management; with financial, production, and marketing specialists; and with equipment and materials suppliers.How to become Nutrition SciencesNatural sciences managers usually advance to management positions after years of employment as scientists. Natural sciences managers typically have a bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, or Ph.D. in a scientific discipline or a related field, such as engineering. Some managers may find it helpful to have an advanced management degree—for example, a Professional Science Master’s (PSM) degree.EducationNatural sciences managers typically begin their careers as scientists; therefore, most have a bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, or Ph.D. in a scientific discipline or a closely related field, such as engineering. Scientific and technical knowledge is essential for managers because they must be able to understand the work of their subordinates and provide technical assistance when needed.Natural sciences managers who are interested in acquiring postsecondary education in management should be able to find master’s degree or Ph.D. programs in a natural science that incorporate business management courses. Professional Science Master’s (PSM) degree programs blend advanced training in a particular science field, such as biotechnology or environmental science, with business skills, such as communications and program management, and policy. Those interested in acquiring general management skills may pursue a Master of Business Administration (MBA) or a Master of Public Administration (MPA). Some natural sciences managers will have studied psychology or some other management-related field to enter this occupation.Sciences managers must continually upgrade their knowledge because of the rapid growth of scientific developments.Work Experience in a Related OccupationNatural sciences managers usually work several years in the sciences before advancing to management positions. While employed as scientists, they typically are given more responsibility and independence in their work as they gain experience. Eventually, they may lead research teams and have control over the direction and content of projects before being promoted to an managerial position.Licenses, Certifications, and RegistrationsAlthough certification is not typically required to become a natural sciences manager, many relevant certifications are available. These certifications range from those related to specific scientific areas of study or practice, such as laboratory animal management, to general management topics, such as project management.Important QualitiesCommunication skills. Natural sciences managers must be able to communicate clearly with a variety of audiences, such as scientists, policymakers, and the public. Both written and oral communication are important.Critical-thinking skills. Natural sciences managers must carefully evaluate the work of others. They must determine if their staff’s methods and results are based on sound science.Interpersonal skills. Natural sciences managers lead research teams and therefore need to work well with others in order to reach common goals. Managers routinely deal with conflict, which they must be able to turn into positive outcomes for their organization.Leadership skills. Natural sciences managers must be able to organize, direct, and motivate others. They need to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their workers and create an environment in which the workers can succeed.Problem-solving skills. Natural sciences managers use scientific observation and analysis to find answers to complex technical questions.Time-management skills. Natural sciences managers must be able to perform multiple administrative, supervisory, and technical tasks while ensuring that projects remain on schedule.What people in similar profession doJob TitleWhat they doHow to become oneInternational and Global Studies Political scientists study the origin, development, and operation of political systems.

Political scientists need a master&rsquo;s degree or Ph.D. in political science, public administration, or a related field. Education Most political scientists need to complete either a master&rsquo;s or Ph.D. program. To be admitted to a graduate program, applicants should complete undergraduate courses in political science, writing, and statistics. Applicants also benefit from having related work or internship experience. Political scientists often complete a master of public administration (MPA), master of public policy (MPP), or master of public affairs degree.Nutrition Sciences Natural sciences managers supervise the work of scientists, including chemists, physicists, and biologists.
