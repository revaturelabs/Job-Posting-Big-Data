All opinions are my own.For years I have been looking at Dewalt tools with the intent to add them to my collection. While they are primarily marketed to a contractor based clientele. However, I also have a large number of friends who are weekend handymen. While their tool selection can be all over the place, it is extremely common to find Dewalt tools mixed into their collection.Dewalt is known for their rugged tools and their durability and when my friends go looking for tools to do the job, they love the idea of being to purchase the same products as the professionals.Personally, my favourite line of the tools are the cordless tools. Since I occasionally work in property management, the ability to take my tools around for a quick setup and tear down is important. Cordless tools allow this to happen in the most efficient way possible and the stronger these tools become, the easier it is to operate with solely cordless tools.Introducing The Dewalt 20V MAX Jobsite FanDEWALT has now introduced the 20V MAX Jobsite Fan, which continues the expansion of the 20V MAX system of products. The Jobsite Fan is compatible with the DEWALT 20V MAX and FLEXVOLT battery systems.The 20V MAX Jobsite Fan is UL Listed and tested to IP54. With up to seven hours of runtime when used with a 4.0Ah battery (sold separately) at maximum speed, the fan can also run from an AC power source. The fan can be used to circulate air, cool down work areas, and help dry paint and other wet materials.There are several convenient options for mounting the fan. Depending on the jobsite, the fan can be hung from adjustable steel hanging hooks, or mounted by screw or tripod to fit your needs. With a pivoting head and variable speed switch, you can easily adjust the fan to best suit your work area.I love the possibility of getting 7 hours out of a battery. While most of my jobs will not require the use of a fan for that length of time, this does reduce the need to constantly charge the battery. It gives me the ability to have the fan available for longer amounts of time if the situation dictates that.However, there is an added advantage to this fan. Because it can be powered both by plug as well as 20V MAX system it can sometimes suit double duty. This fan is great in my shed when I am working on my various projects. It also is great in our upstairs hallway where we use it to supplement our other fans. This is because we are currently about a month into an average 40 Degree Celcius humidex.What would you use your Dewalt 20V MAX Jobsite Fan for?APPIP ERROR: amazonproducts[AccessDeniedAwsUsers|The Access Key Id AKIAIKE5A5NPCYVKCHFQ is not enabled for accessing this version of Product Advertising API.
