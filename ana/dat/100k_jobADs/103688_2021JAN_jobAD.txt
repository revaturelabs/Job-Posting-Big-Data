PLEASE TAKE NOTE: We are providing flight ticket and free accommodation for every successfulapplicant. But all successful applicants will pay forthe cost of their visa and work permit. VISA: You will pay your visa fee at the British embassy in your country. But before we canlodge your visa application, you have to get youremployment letter and work permit fromLondon.

WORK PERMIT: We have subsidized work permit fees so you will pay £300 for your work permit.You will send the work permit processing fee tothe UK work permit office here in London. Oncethey issue your work permit, we will then sendyour original copies of your employmentdocuments, invitation letter, and sponsorship details to your address through DHL.As soon as you received the DHL package, youwill thereafter go to the embassy and pick upyour application because we will also file foryour visa application from the UK.
