Once the contract is signed, you can use the name any way you like. You can change it or alter it in any way – it’s yours.The non-winning names remain the property of the person who suggested those names. This means you may not use those other names in any way.

The more active you are in the project, the more name suggestions you will get. We’ll let you know every time a new name or comment comes in and invite you to give feedback. Years of experience show us that projects with active clients will receive more than double the names compared to projects with low client participation.Can you buy more than one name?Like more than one name? It happens all the time. You can start your project with multiple awards or add awards at any time during your project. You can also make offers on additional names after your project has been awarded.Can you ask namers to tweak the names?Absolutely! In fact, this is a key factor for success. Once the names start rolling in, let the creatives know what you think about their name ideas. You can score and give individual feedback. You can also update your brief if you want to address all participants in your project. They are happy to make changes and iterate on their suggestions.When you score each name suggestion (1 to 5 stars), your score and comments are private. Only you and the individual creative will see the star rating and comments on their name. Updates to your brief are public for all participants in the project.\"In 10 years I have launched 17 projects on crowdspring and have always been impressed.
