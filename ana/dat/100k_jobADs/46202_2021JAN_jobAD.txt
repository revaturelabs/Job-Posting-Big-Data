Keep some of your business cards in your pocket. Attend networking events. In Kokomo the Chamber of Commerce does a great job listing opportunities to network.

Connecting with people is a must.Share this:ShareClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...Leave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
