But, there’s a catch. You need a job to get that experience. This is a frustrating challenge many new graduates face. Internships provide a near perfect solution.Internships help bridge the gap between what you learn in school and what the real world calls for. Job seekers get the opportunity to pick up valuable professional experience. They also get the chance to see their chosen career from the inside out.Internship programs are not only helpful to those looking for a job. Many organizations who offer these types of roles, use them as a hiring tool. Recruitment and training is an expensive affair both in cost and in time. These opportunities are a great way to observe new talent and determine whether they are a good fit for the team.This course helps participants avoid the disappointment of completing a great internship and not receiving a job offer because of something they did or failed to do. It goes beyond the usual advice which tells them to perform well and work hard. By the end of the course, participants have a concrete plan with clear steps for what to do before, during, and after the internship to improve the chances of landing a full-time position when the contract comes to an end. They also learn how to get noticed and build professional networks to help advance their careers.Who Should Attend This Turning An Internship Into A Job WorkshopThis Turning An Internship Into A Job workshop is ideal for anyone who would like to gain a strong grasp and improve their Turning An Internship Into A Job.All Staff Within An OrganisationManagersTeam LeadersExecutivesAssistantsOfficersSecretariesGroup Size For This Turning An Internship Into A Job Training ProgramThe ideal group size for this Turning An Internship Into A Job course is:Minimum: 5 ParticipantsMaximum: 15 ParticipantsCourse Duration For This Turning An Internship Into A Job Skills CourseThe duration of this Turning An Internship Into A Job workshop is 2 full days.
