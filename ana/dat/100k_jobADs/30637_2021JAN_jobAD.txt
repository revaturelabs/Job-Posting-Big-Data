For example, if a patient does not like the appearance of their dorsal bump, the wideness of their nose, or the overall shape of the nose, a surgical rhinoplasty can address these issues. A non-surgical rhinoplasty is also an option for certain concerns. However, will a rhinoplasty fix a deviated septum? A nose job can also correct many medical and structural problems with the nose. While a full scale rhinoplasty is not always necessary to correct structural issues, these can be corrected during a routine nose job. One of the most common structural deformities of the nose is a deviated septum. A deviated septum is when the wall separating your nasal passages is more to one side than the other. In some cases, this causes no symptoms or issues. For others though, this can cause major breathing issues and contribute to conditions like allergies and sleep apnea. So, will a rhinoplasty fix a deviated septum. The answer is usually, yes! A septoplasty is the surgical procedure that corrects a deviated septum. Dr. Jonov can perform a septoplasty as part of a rhinoplasty procedure.
