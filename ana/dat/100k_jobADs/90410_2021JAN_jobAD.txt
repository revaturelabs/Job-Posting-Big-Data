You can use both the matching oil and powder on a candle before it is burnt to aid the magical work. So for example, a few drops of come to oil and a sprinkling of come to me powder on a red candle would aid that magical work for a come to me spell. Powders and oils can also be used in mojo bags, gris gris bags and magical pouches as well as anointing candles, wearing on your skin (please make sure this is safe first by asking!), cleansing altars, tools and homes, charging amulets, talismans and spell jars and bottles, adding to honey jars and more. They can be sprinkled around your home or personal items that have some link to your magical work (for example, for workings for money, sprinkle in or around your purse) or they can be sprinkled around the intended persons home or items (for example, a crossing powder could be sprinkled around the home of someone you wish to cross and then a candle fixed (anointed) with crossing oil burnt). Some of our oils and powders contain toxic herbs or herbs that may cause an allergy so they must not be taken internally or used on the skin.Related productsInterview Powder – Witchcraft Hoodoo Voodoo Conjure Santeria – 10ml Amber Glass Bottle (Small Personal Size)£5.50 Add to basketStop Arguments Powder – Witchcraft Wicca Hoodoo Voodoo Conjure Santeria – 10ml Amber Glass Bottle (Small Personal Size)£5.50 Add to basketLaw Keep Away Oil | Law Away Oil – Hoodoo Voodoo Witchcraft Santeria Conjure – 10ml Amber Glass Bottle (Small Personal Size)£5.50 Add to basketInfluence Powder – Hoodoo Voodoo Witchcraft Santeria Conjure – 10ml Amber Glass Bottle (Small Personal Size)£5.50 Add to basketBoss Fix Oil | Make Your Boss On Your Side – Hoodoo Voodoo Witchcraft Santeria Conjure – 10ml Amber Glass Bottle (Small Personal Size)£5.50 Add to basketSteady Employment Oil – Hoodoo Voodoo Conjure Witchcraft Santeria – 10ml Amber Glass Bottle (Small Personal Size)£5.50 Add to basketSteady Work Powder – Hoodoo Voodoo Conjure Witchcraft Santeria – 10ml Amber Glass Bottle (Small Personal Size)£5.50 Add to basketCrown Of Success Powder – Hoodoo Voodoo Conjure Witchcraft Santeria – 10ml Amber Glass Bottle (Small Personal Size)£5.50 Add to basketCustom Made For Any Purpose Powerful Mojo Bag£15.00 Add to basketPay Me Oil – Hoodoo Voodoo Witchcraft Wicca Pagan – 10ml Amber Glass Bottle (Small Personal Size)£5.50 Add to basketBusiness Blessings Powder – Hoodoo Voodoo Witchcraft Wicca Pagan – 10ml Amber Glass Bottle (Small Personal Size)£5.50 Add to basketGet A Job Powder – Hoodoo Voodoo Witchcraft Wicca Pagan – 10ml Amber Glass Bottle (Small Personal Size)£5.50 Add to basketProduct CategoriesHandmade Magical Oils, Spell Oils & Anointing Oils – 10ml Amber Glass Bottles (Small Personal Size)Handmade Magical Oils, Spell Oils & Anointing Oils – 50ml Amber Glass Bottles (Large Practitioner Size)Handmade Magical Spell Powders, Blessing Powders, Dirts & Dusts – 10ml Amber Glass Bottle (Small Personal Size)Handmade Magical Spell Powders, Blessing Powders, Dirts & Dusts – 50ml Amber Glass Bottles (Large Practitioner Size)Handmade Magical Waters, Floor Washes & VinegarsHandmade Spell & Ritual Incense Blends, Incense Sticks & Incense ToolsAura Sprays™, Magical Room Sprays & Magical Spell SpraysHandmade Cleansing Salt & Herb MixesHandmade Magical Spell Writing Inks & Writing AccessoriesHerbs, Roots, Barks, Resins, Magical Ingredients & Spell SundriesPrayer Cards, Saint Cards, Sigil Cards, Veve Cards, Loa Cards, Demon Cards etc.Himalayan Salt Chunk & Herb Ambient Magic Mixes™Handmade Magical HoneySpell Candles, Herbal Candles & Magical CandlesHandmade Authentic Mojo BagsHandmade Magical Herbal Blends (Herb Mixes)Magical Coloured Rice & Herb MixHandmade & Blessed SpellvelopesMagical Items, Altar Tools, Decorative Items, Gifts, Keepsakes, Pictures, Plaques & DreamcatchersMagical & Spiritual Inspired JewelleryUK Spells, Spell Casting Service, Witch Training, Witch Consultations, Tarot Readings, Numerology Readings, Pendulum Readings & Other Witchcraft ServicesProducts By SituationLove / Friendship / Sex / Marriage / Fidelity / Relationships / FertilityUncrossing / Spell breaking / Jinx Hex Curse Removing / Banishing / ExorcismMoney / Good Luck / Legal / Court CaseBusiness / Jobs / WorkProtectionHex / Curse / Jinx / CrossingDo As I Say / Commanding / Compelling / ControllingShut Up / Go Away / Move Away & Stay AwaySleep / Peace & Calm / Harmony & ForgivenessHealingI Can Do This!
