Yet, candidates are often skeptical. Let’s look at the most common misconceptions that job seekers have about getting a job through a staffing company:Myth #1: A temporary job is not a “real” job.Myth #2: Jobs you get through staffing companies are low paying.Myth #3: Staffing companies only work with entry level, administrative type candidates.Myth #4: Assignments only last a couple of weeks at a time at the most.Myth #5: Temporary jobs available through staffing companies don’t offer benefits.Many job-seekers, who are fresh out of college looking for their first job, are not entirely clear on what they want to do for a living, but they do know they “want to do something interesting”. These are the same individuals who either are not aware of what the staffing industry has to offer, or are misinformed.
