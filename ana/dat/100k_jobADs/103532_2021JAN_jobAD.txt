Enbridge said then that it expected to achieve about $540 million a year in operational savings.Enbridge said in late February, just days prior to the completion of the takeover, that the merged company would be the largest energy infrastructure company in North America. Spectra owned natural gas and oil pipelines and storage facilities in both Canada and the United States.The merged firm's head office is in Calgary, while its gas pipeline business is in Houston and its liquids pipelines business is based in Edmonton.image:cbc.caShare:Find amazing USA Oil & Gas job leads here.
