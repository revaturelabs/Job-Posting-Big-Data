Jacqui loves the journalistic approach of the who, when, why, what, and how. I wanted to talk with Jacqui about trends not necessarily how to write a resume. These days employers are looking shorten the amount of time they review resumes and what gives them the most information in minimal time.Here are some of the highlights of our discussion:We discuss the significance of the visual resume “The Resume Infographic” by Hannah Morgan and how the resume has evolved since 2009.Jacqui stated that storytelling has gained a drum beat as a mantra reaching epic proportions in the social media circles.Content has become richer, detail, brief with headlines and sub-headlines, but the words matter the most. Jacqui tries to draw out the who, what, when, why, and how to add texture for clients.The visual is an enhancement to the content since words are the area of importance. Charts and graphs illustrate in a snapshot view of some of the content. It takes content and condenses it or takes condensed content and gives it a top for those skimming or reader that what the dashes of excitement.Jacqui stated that a visual resume shouldn’t be your primary resume, but there is an audience for “visual” as a part of your web portfolioPeople need to slow down and think through the foundational stories behind visuals become more meaningful, and knowing that they have roots – understanding who you’ve become and why that mattersLinkedin has become a channel that can model value shown on a resume. Jacqui says that 90% of her clients will have Linkedin profile created in addition to a resumeLinkedin has expanded from being an acceptable static profile to a more dynamic. Job seekers must consider their audience and customize his or her participationSocial media can now be viewed or previewed of epilog of your resume. We should be expanding our view of what a resume is although it’s an old term, and it says so muchEach person should know their story from the beginning to today and into the futureI asked Jacqui to share how the stories will differ between the resume and social mediums. In your process, you may end up in a different place in your career while enhancing the story elements.I hope you enjoy this rare extra long conversation.
