Between the flexibility to work from home when necessary, to traveling the world, this company always encourages a balance. I really appreciate that I never have to put my life on pause -- it’s a freedom that makes this company so wonderful.TaylorCustomer Acquisition SpecialistHow has your career grown since starting at the company?My career has grown tremendously since joining FabFitFun in 2015! I started as a Jr. Account Manager, and have worked my way up to Director, Strategic Merchandising! FabFitFun helped me to not only switch teams, but also encouraged me to take courses on any skills that I wanted to improve for my new position.CarlyDirector, Strategic MerchandisingHow do you make yourself accessible to the rest of the team?I believe in casually connecting with my team on a regular basis. During lunch I will often go to one of our team rooms and eat with them, and aim to not talk about work. My hope is that this connection will encourage them to ask me when they need something. I also try to encourage direct feedback by being grateful for ANY feedback I receive.ArjenSVP, PeopleWhat are FabFitFun Perks + BenefitsFabFitFun Benefits OverviewAmazing benefits including medical, dental, vision (+ Pet insurance!)401K & MatchingOpen/Flexible PTO policy - we trust our employees to manage their timeDonation matching programFree FabFitFun subscription and quarterly credit in our e-commerce Add-Ons storeMonthly cell phone reimbursementMonthly work from home stipend while the company is temporarily remoteCultureVolunteer in local communityPartners with NonprofitsEach of our seasonal boxes partners with a charity/nonprofit organization.Friends outside of workEat lunch togetherDaily stand upOpen door policyTeam based strategic planningGroup brainstorming sessionsOpen office floor planDiversityHighly diverse management teamHiring Practices that Promote DiversityHealth Insurance & Wellness BenefitsFlexible Spending Account (FSA)Disability InsuranceDental BenefitsVision BenefitsHealth Insurance BenefitsLife InsurancePet InsuranceMental Health BenefitsRetirement & Stock Options Benefits401(K)401(K) MatchingCompany EquityMatch charitable contributionsChild Care & Parental Leave BenefitsGenerous Parental LeaveFlexible Work ScheduleFamily Medical LeaveReturn-to-work program post parental leaveVacation & Time Off BenefitsUnlimited Vacation PolicyGenerous PTOPaid HolidaysPaid Sick DaysPerks & DiscountsCasual DressCommuter BenefitsCompany OutingsStocked KitchenStocked kitchen with amazing snacks that suit both looking for something healthy or a sweet treat in the afternoon.
