Better yet, tell two friends about us today.You know what’s a pain in the butt? Collecting money from people. Maybe you’re the captain of your intramural team and need to collect entry fees from your teammates (my volleyball league starts on Sunday!) or your group of friends want to do the “pitch in” and buy The Drake a big-screen tv (yes, that’s a Seinfeld reference). Maybe you want to easily collect donations or collect money from your 9 deadbeat roommates who never pay the cable bill. (Or maybe you’re collecting money for an NCAA Tournament bracket that may or may not be violating gambling laws.) You can collect cash, checks, or try to use PayPal. No matter what you do, it’s probably going to be frustrating. WePay is a Palo Alto, CA based company that wants to change that. They’ve built the “best way to collect money from other people.” Their site allows you to “send bills, sell tickets, and accept donations” while easily tracking payments and managing money. It’s essentially a group bank account (you can even get a debit card for it)I Pay, You Pay, We All Pay on WePayThis is where I announce that I’m now going to start using WePay to charge you for these daily e-mails. Just kidding (but if you feel like paying, I can definitely set up a WePay account). I’m a prankster, just like the team at WePay, except they’re way better than me at pulling gags. Like the time that they dropped $100 bills frozen in a 600 pound ice block in front of PayPal’s developer conference. Why would they do such a thing? To take a jab at PayPal for constantly freezing people’s accounts. WePay is extremely focused on making group payments simple and pain-free. They know that they face stiff competition from entrenched competitors that have more reputability (which is important when it’s money related), so they’re constantly working to generate awareness about how much better their product is. If you’re a fan of what WePay is doing, then you’ll want to give their Jobs page a look. They’re currently hiring a Designer, an Operations Associate, a Web Developer, and Campus Champions. The company is strongly focused on the college market because group payments are pretty common for twenty-somethings, so it’d be a great place to start your career after graduation.Links to Help You Begin Your ResearchWePay.comJobs at WePayAbout WePayWePay’s TeamWePay’s FAQWePay in the NewsHave you used WePay for any group payments?Related CompaniesWe've identified WePay as having career opportunities in the following categories:all employersbankingbusiness developmentCaliforniadesignfinancegraphic designmarketingoperationspersonal financesalessoftware developmentuser experienceweb developmentJobs Near YouBid On Local Painting Jobs - Reach New Customers In Your AreaHomeAdvisor New York, NY ViewBid On Local Remodeling Jobs - Reach New Customers In Your AreaHomeAdvisor New York, NY ViewPackage HandlerHelloFresh Jersey City, NJ ViewPackage HandlerHelloFresh Jersey City, NJ ViewDelivery Driver - No Experience NeededDoorDash Brooklyn, NY ViewLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
