Here is my recent animation work that it have been broadcasting once every week on NHK Japanese TV program that is called Shakiin. I worked as a character designer and animator. (Not good looking pictures above.. my bad!)It is one of the segments of the show which is count-quiz: which group of goblins get more nuts, its difficulty is risen a bit by bit through the season.Somehow I cannot stop adore those cuties even though I created them!This entry was posted in Job: animation and tagged animation, freelance, industry.
