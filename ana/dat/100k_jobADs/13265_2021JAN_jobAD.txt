For our more in-depth guide, click here.How can I tell a good LED and how do I know you’re selling them?You get what you pay for;We test them ourselves (and have most varieties installed at HQ);We only sell bulbs with a minimum 3 years warranty: guaranteed savings. If a bulb is supposed to last 10, 000s of hours then why would it only come with a one year warranty…?We only offer LEDs with as close to daylight quality as you can get.Selecting the best LEDsHere are the 7 main areas we look at when deciding which LEDs to recommend. Quality in all 7 varies greatly:1. Heat sink:How well does the bulb dissipate heat? LED bulbs are efficient so they don’t get burning hot, but they do get warm.Heat is drawn away from the LEDs by a heat sink normally located in the base of the bulb which dissipates into the surrounding environment. Read more.2. Chip setOne of the the highest indicators of quality: the chip is used to convert electricity to light.Chips from better bulbs will be more efficient, converting more energy into light. Read more.3. The driverThe driver regulates the power entering the LEDs- they can be internal or external.At the moment, MR16s have an external driver meaning they are slight more difficult to install. GU10s have internal drivers and, for this reason we’d recommend either changing the fitting or, really simply, just using an ending adaptor. Read more.4. Colour temperatureLED lights are available in many different colours from warm white to blue. This is known as the colour temperature. We'd mostly recommend a warm / daylight coloured bulb. Read more.5. Bulb brightness- lumens, not wattsWe’ve all been conditioned to think of bulb brightness in watts, but this doesn’t make sense. LEDs are far more efficient, giving out more light with fewer watts. A 50w halogen GU10 spotlight can be replaced with an equivalent 5w LED GU10 spotlight – achieving massive energy savings. Lumens- nothing to do with the power- can be measured across the board, like-for-like.The more lumens a bulb is producing, the brighter it is (regardless of power/ wattage usage). Read more.6. Beam AngleLEDs are directional in order to not waste energy through unwanted side lighthey can be any angle you want. As a rule of thumb, if you’ve got a high ceiling you can have a lower beam angle. Read more.7. Quality is key:With LED lighting, as with many products, quality is absolutely key. Whilst you may be able to find an LED in the shops for £3 a bulb, chances are that it will produce poor light and pack up within the year. We recommend spending a little more on a quality bulb and getting one that will last for years, give off a quality light and save you money.
