I thought, ‘Those who are older should speak, for wisdom comes with age.’ But there is a spirit within people, the breath of the Almighty within them, that makes them intelligent.Sometimes the elders are not wise. Sometimes the aged do not understand justice.So listen to me, and let me tell you what I think.” Job 32:7-10Elihu is about to lay it down for Job, and in my opinion, give the best insight we’ll read in this book. We have a lot to learn from him! First of all, he waited his turn. You know when you’re sitting around listening to other people give your friend advice, and it’s horrible? He sat through a lot of that. He humbled himself. He waited until his older and seemingly wiser peers spoke first. He didn’t insist on speaking first or turn the attention of the room on him immediately.These are marks of someone with godly advice. What he said in the verses above are true: the Holy Spirit surpasses age. Age is just a number.Has God gifted you with wisdom that surpasses your age or experience? Use it wisely. Let’s be like Elihu, and wait our turn. When the right timing comes, extend your advice with graciousness.Another thing I noticed here is he doesn’t wait for Job to ask what he thinks. He says “listen, let me tell you what I think”, and rolls right into it. If God has put something on your heart to be shared, don’t wait for an invitation from the person. Sometimes, that’s the right thing to do. A LOT of the time, it’s a way to wiggle out of speaking unwanted truth into the ear of someone who needs to hear it. Waiting for the right timing doesn’t mean waiting to be asked.Do you have a truth God has put on your heart that needs to be shared?-CarlyShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...Post navigationPreviousJob 29-30NextJob 33-34Leave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
