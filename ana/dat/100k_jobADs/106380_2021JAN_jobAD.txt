More information about AMPL can be found here.Over five years, MemTrain will train 12 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs; within 4 years of Masters qualification) undertaking a PhD in an area of research within the remit of AMPL, each of which is expected to have an intersectoral focus. Possible projects involve determining the roles of biological membranes in biotechnology or medicines discovery and the application of novel methodologies to investigate these membranes. Our 11 industrial partners will contribute to training of the researchers to generate a unique, integrated, learning environment in which graduate students benefit from industrial links, employability and entrepreneurial skills, and will leave as researchers who are highly competitive for jobs within academia and industry, as well as public policy, intellectual property law or as entrepreneurs.The first cohort of ESRs were appointed in October 2019 and it is expected that 7 ESRs will be recruited in this call.In light of the current Coronavirus pandemic, the deadline for applications has been extended to 24th May 2020. All interviews will now take place via Skype or other video conferencing platforms. The revised timeline is shown below.Further information about the MemTrain project and the team can be found on our website at:https://www.memtrain.org.uk/Coordination:Dr Alan Goddard This email address is being protected from spambots.
