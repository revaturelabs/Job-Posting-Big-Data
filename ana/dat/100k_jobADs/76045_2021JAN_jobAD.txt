Also, new technologies will allow doctors to perform more procedures to treat ailments previously deemed incurable. Significant employment opportunities are expected to be available for family practitioners, internists, geriatricians, preventative care specialists, and pediatricians. Employment prospects should also be good for doctors that specialize in dealing with health issues that largely affect aging baby boomers. For example, there will be a demand for doctors specializing in cardiology or radiology since the risks for heart disease and cancer increase as people age. As delivery of health care shifts from hospitals to clinics and outpatient centres, it is possible that a greater number of doctors will become salaried employees. Competition among newly trained doctors will be very high in large cities. Doctors willing to enter practice in inner cities and rural areas are likely to encounter little difficulty.Up Nextloading...DoctorAvg Salary$106kGrowthN/ASatisfactionHighYour CompatibilityOverviewSalaryJob MarketHow to BecomeJobsEducationFurther ResourcesSatisfactionPersonalityDemographicsWork EnvironmentFor IndividualsBlogLoginSign UpThe CareerExplorer Career TestHave a license number?ExploreCareer CollectionsWhat Career Is Right For Me?Careers in FinanceCareers in MedicineCareers in PsychologyCareers in TravelFor InstitutionsGroup PricingÂ© Sokanu Interactive Inc. 2021About CareerExplorerContactFAQ Knowledge BaseTerms & conditionsPrivacy"
