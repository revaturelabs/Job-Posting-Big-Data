The company is investing $1.5 million and moving 45 jobs to the North Mississippi location.“Krone is known worldwide for its high-quality hay and forage equipment, and the company’s decision to locate its North American headquarters and distribution operations and move dozens of jobs to DeSoto County demonstrates to industry leaders around the world that Mississippi is a great place to do business,” Governor Phil Bryant said.Krone NA will lease approximately 45 percent, or 265,000 square feet of space, in a facility currently being constructed by Exeter Property Group in the Crossroads Distribution Center. The company’s new location will consolidate two warehouse operations into one facility, enhancing parts and machine deliveries, pickup and shipping and parts inventory management. The new location also will improve access by commercial carriers, dealers and customers as a result of the completion of the I-269 connector, which offers connections to I-55, I-22 and I-40.“Krone North America wanted to remain in the mid-south region. Working with our long-time agent, Jon Albright, KNA executives met with the DeSoto County Economic Development Council, the Mississippi Development Authority, the city of Olive Branch and the DeSoto County Board of Supervisors,” said Krone NA President Rusty Fowler. “This is a business-friendly group of people who strongly and positively engage with business. Through their joint efforts, KNA made the decision to relocate to Olive Branch. We look forward to continuing our relationship with these folks in the coming years and being a good corporate citizen in the Olive Branch area.”The Mississippi Development Authority is providing assistance to relocate and install equipment. The city of Olive Branch is providing assistance in the form of property tax exemptions.“Olive Branch’s prime location coupled with a robust transportation network positions Krone NA to effectively serve its customers, as well as enable the company to contribute to North Mississippi’s economy for many years to come,” said MDA Executive Director Glenn McCullough, Jr. “We salute the teamwork of the DeSoto County Economic Development Council, DeSoto County Board of Supervisors and the city of Olive Branch, which, along with MDA, played a key role in making this move happen.”Krone plans to begin its move to the Olive Branch location by the end of this year.Categories and SearchSearch in https://mississippi.org/SearchSelect a category Select a Category Advanced Manufacturing Aerospace Agribusiness Automotive Data Centers & IT Distribution & Warehousing Energy Entrepreneur General Health Care Infrastructure ShipbuildingNews RoomMississippi StoriesEventsLogos & PublicationsAnnual ReportVideos501 North West Street,	Jackson, Mississippi 39201	Mailing Address:Post Office Box 849	Jackson, Mississippi 39205	P: 601.359.3449	/ 800.360.3323	F: 601.359.2832	Visit our Facebook page.Visit our Twitter page.Visit our Linkedin PageSitemapContactTransparencyMDA Employees©2021 Mississippi Development Authority.
