It’ll tell you all about me. I really want this job.What’s wrong with this message as it’s currently written?The substance of the above email is OK. You are, after all, attaching your resume. Possibly a cover letter too. This should give the reader a much better idea of who you are.But what’s lacking here is a degree of formality and detail. You wrote the message in casual language. And it makes the reader guess about which job you’re applying. Professionalize the style and content to a greater extent than you ordinarily would.What? Even Emails Have To Be Formal?During your job search – and afterward as well, once you’re re-employed – sending proper emails is vital for your career. All levels of an organization value communication skills. Don’t be misunderstood. Make sure you convey information in ways that represent a positive image of you (and your employer) to others.In the world of work, quite often, “you are what you write.” This is nowhere more true than when submitting your resume and cover letter for consideration. Every impression counts. Your emailed message may be the very first thing a potential employer sees from you.When “Casual” Causes ConcernsA hastily written, informal message like the one in the example atop this page, may cause employers to see you as amateurish or lazy. “If you don’t even take time to present yourself in your best light within your job application,” they might mutter to themselves, “and you force us to do extra work by having to guess about which job you’re even applying for,” they say with clenched teeth, “then what can we realistically expect once we bring you aboard?”Luckily it doesn’t take much to submit a better version of your message.Give SpecificsYou’re applying for a specific job. To you, it may be the one that’s front and center in your mind at this time. But the employer may be posting several different positions at once. They’ll probably receive a large number of application emails, not just yours.So make it easy for them to sort the incoming emails by letting them know which job you want. In the Subject Line itself, concisely state the purpose of your email. Mention the job’s title or a reference number that you saw in the advertised posting. You could write something like “Job Application Enclosed: Claims Adjuster, reference A47kj2w1.”This also applies to the top part of the message you’ll type into the body of this email. You can begin with a header that repeats itself, as in “re: Job Application: Claims Adjuster, reference A47kj2w1.”Use “Business Formal” LanguageRegardless of what you type in the email’s body underneath your header, don’t drop your guard and suddenly start using casual language.At a minimum, you might try instead to turn the phrasing from our email example into the following:Dear employer,I am very interested in applying for the Claims Adjuster position you advertised on Monster.ca recently. My qualifications and experience match your specifications almost exactly.Please take a moment to review my attached Application Documents:- Up-To-Date Resume- Customized Cover LetterIt would be a sincere pleasure to hear back from you soon to discuss this exciting opportunity.Sincerely,[your first and last names, plus your contact phone number(s), email, go here]Is This Sufficient?Formal language, identifying the job you’re applying for, and stating which documents you’ve attached: is there anything you should do in the body of your emailed job application?Some job seekers like to include a customized, more elaborate cover letter within the body of the email itself. This saves the reader from having to open your separate attachments into a different program.Still, it may make sense to attach a fully formatted, fancy version of the cover letter along with the resume. This way, if the employer wants printouts of “good copies” to pass around, they can do so quickly with minimal effort.You could also try to find out the name and title of the person to whom you’ll be mailing your application. This is not always necessary, though, in higher-level jobs, it can help you stand out from the crowd. Which of course, is something you want to do, when possible, so long as standing out presents you as more qualified or enthusiastic.You may also want to readTake The Monster Poll!Take our pollFor Job Seekers For Job SeekersBrowse JobsSalary ToolsCareer AdviceCompany ProfileHelpFor Employers For EmployersProductsPricingResourcesHelpAbout Us About UsMonster InternationalHelpful Resources Helpful ResourcesTerms of UsePrivacy CentreSecurity CentreAccessibility CentreCookie SettingsAdChoicesFind us on social mediaFacebook Twitter Instagram YouTube PinterestGet the Monster App© 2021 Monster Worldwide ©2019 Monster - All Rights Reserved - U.S. Patent No. 7,599,930 B1; 7,827,125 and 7,836,060 - NYSE: MWW - V: 2020.26.0.27-816Looking for Monster Cable?Back to top"
