The WA Training Awards highlight the achievements of apprentices, trainees, VET students, training organisations and employers in the training sector. Some category winners will now advance to compete against the nation's best at the Australian Training Awards in Sydney on November 15, 2018.Women in vocational education and training (VET) were in the spotlight, winning seven of the eight individual categories. Bassendean electrician Megan Feaver, who decided to take the leap into the male-dominated trade later in life, was named WA Apprentice of the Year 2018 at the event. The South Metropolitan TAFE graduate has excelled since making the career change, securing a coveted Western Power apprenticeship and winning Western Power's Apprentice of the Year.Already actively involved with the Women in Male Dominated Occupations and Industries network, Megan aspires to lead and encourage women into non-traditional trades. And Megan was in good company – while women made up less than half of publicly funded enrolments in the VET sector in 2017, more than 70 per cent of the pool of WA Training Awards 2018 finalists were female.A full list of winners with their profiles, and photographs from the night, will soon be available on the WA Training Awards website.Education and Training Minister Sue Ellery, attending the presentation dinner, said \"This year's WA Training Awards have shone a light on women excelling in STEM and non-traditional trades while making the most of the opportunities offered by WA's VET sector.\"\"The training system provides opportunities for people to change their lives - to take up their dream career, get a better pay packet and improve their skills. The awards highlight those apprentices, trainees and students who are doing just that, as well as the trainers and employers giving them the opportunity and the skills. I congratulate all winners and finalists on their achievement – they are inspiring others to take advantage of WA's high-quality training sector, helping ensure WA has the skilled workforce it needs to fill the jobs of the future.\"WA Training Awards 2018 winnersThe WA Apprentice of the Year 2018, sponsored by MEGT (Australia) LtdMegan Feaver, South Metropolitan TAFEWA School-based Apprentice of the Year 2018, sponsored by ECA WACaitlin Whittle, Tubal Workplace TrainingWA Trainee of the Year 2018, sponsored by McDonald's AustraliaBeth Hodder, ABS Institute of Management; Australian Industry TrainingWA Vocational Student of the Year 2018, sponsored by Crown PerthCaitlan Noble, North Metropolitan TAFEWA Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Student of the Year 2018, sponsored by The Graham (Polly) Farmer FoundationSoleil White, Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Services and North Regional TAFEWA International Student of the Year 2018Ananda Paiva, North Metropolitan TAFEWA Cultural Diversity Training Award 2018William Bol, North Metropolitan TAFEWA Trainer of the Year 2018, sponsored by Training Accreditation CouncilCrystle Challinger, Canning Vale CollegeWA Employer of the Year 2018, sponsored CCI Apprenticeship Support AustraliaRoy Hill, Perth AirportWA Industry Collaboration Award 2018Central Regional TAFE - Biodiversity Conservation Collaboration, GeraldtonWA Small Training Provider of the Year 2018Mental Health Commission - Strong Spirit Strong Mind Aboriginal Programs, PerthWA Large Training Provider of the Year 2018North Metropolitan TAFEPage last updated October 01, 2018Back to topQuick clicksReview of Skills, Training and Workforce DevelopmentGet skills ready and job ready with free training, half price courses and more!Search for coursesFind your local Jobs and Skills CentreView our jobs boardAboriginal services jobs boardOut of Contract Register: Find an apprentice or traineeApprentice and Trainee Reengagement IncentiveContact usjobsandskillswa@dtwd.wa.gov.auFind your local Jobs and Skills CentreCall your nearest Jobs and Skills Centre 13 64 64Enquiries and feedbackWe welcome your enquiries and feedback.Use our online formLodge a formal complaintFor feedback or enquiries about this website:website@dtwd.wa.gov.auTwitterFacebookYouTubeThe Department of Training and Workforce Development acknowledges the Aboriginal peoples of Western Australia as traditional custodians of the lands and waters.
