It should be able to play whatever I throw at it. Mostly Blurays. I do have a few 3DMKVs that may or may not work in XBMC. I am not too concerned. I figured I would do this build over buying a Popcorn Hour. Is this the right choice?I don't want to pay money for a Windows OS just to do this, so I am thinking of installing Linux Mint on a 2.5'' HDD and being done with it. The USB IR receiver is for a Logitech Harmony One. I am aware that I have to tweak linux a bit to be able to work with this remote for XMBC so I am currently looking into that.Is there anything else I should know about a small form factor setup like this?I am planning on throwing in a Bluetooth dongle on the back in case we switch from Xfinity by the time I move back home from college and I cannot use the xbox360 app anymore. That way, I can just get out a wireless keyboard and navigate to xfinity.com and watch my stuff that way.Thanks!LOL_Wut_AxelDiamond MemberMar 26, 20114,310881Feb 17, 2013#2Zacate isn't really worth it for an HTPC. For the same money you can just get a Celeron/H61 motherboard combo and enjoy significantly higher performance and efficiency. Also, never go with a 2x2GB configuration for DDR3 RAM... it's a waste of money. That being said, for the same amount of money I'd recommend you get this instead:Intel Celeron G550 2.6GHz: $42.99ECS H61H2-I3 H61 Motherboard: $49.99G.Skill 4GB (1x4GB) DDR3-1333: $23.99This would be at least 2-3x faster than the E-350, and you'll definitely notice it in everyday use.serpretetskySenior memberJan 7, 20126251981Feb 17, 2013#3From what i've heard, blu ray playback on pc's in general is not as easy as it should be.I think on linux it's even worse:https://www.ebower.com/docs/ubuntu-bluray/.amd e-350 seem to have been used pretty well for htpc's in general though.http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=125116http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=137233http://www.techenclave.com/reviews-previews/amd-fusion-e350-linux-xbmc-121493/SheHateMeDiamond MemberJul 21, 20127,2512081Feb 17, 2013#4serpretetsky said:From what i've heard, blu ray playback on pc's in general is not as easy as it should be.I think on linux it's even worse:https://www.ebower.com/docs/ubuntu-bluray/.amd e-350 seem to have been used pretty well for htpc's in general though.http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=125116http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=137233http://www.techenclave.com/reviews-previews/amd-fusion-e350-linux-xbmc-121493/Click to expand...I'm not going to be playing any discs.

If I could get by with a modern intel celeron system for the same or just a little more money I would probably try to do that. More reassurane that if you can't get proper video hardware acceleration the processor power should be able to brute force it anyways. Plus intel hardware usually plays nicer with linux in my experience.LOL_Wut_AxelDiamond MemberMar 26, 20114,310881Feb 17, 2013#6SheHateMe said:I'm not going to be playing any discs.

You will get the same hardware acceleration for HD video, and if you happen to use a video format which isn't hardware accelerated the Celeron has enough horsepower to play it with no stuttering. Again, going with the E350 is a no-win.Edit: Looking at the Bench, the G550 should be some 4x faster overall than the E350.http://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/406?vs=328Last edited: Feb 17, 2013crashtestdummyPlatinum MemberFeb 18, 20102,89400Feb 18, 2013#7SheHateMe said:I'm not going to be playing any discs.
