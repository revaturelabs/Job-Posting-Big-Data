There is a lot of truth in that sayingPeople who can get things done are often the “go-to” contractor on a client site, successfully manage multiple contracts at once, and sit on boards for industry associations and charities. If you’re not one of these people, it SHOULD beg a couple of questions: How do they do it? and Can I do that too? After all, it’s the easiest way to increase your revenue and your professional reputation!Obviously not everyone wants to get those extra contracts, so this won’t apply to them. Also, not everyone is willing to work one little bit more than they need to, so this won’t apply to them either. However, if you WANT to be successful, or you WANT to go above and beyond for your clients, or you WANT to do the best that you can then this does apply to you.Truly busy people typically have a couple of characteristics that help them:Attitude. They care! They want to do the right thing. They want to succeed. They take pride in their work.Time Management. They apply sound time management techniques and are always looking to be as efficient as they can.How do they take on that EXTRA task AND get it done?They are motivated to succeed which is really half the battle. Then they give that job the right level of priority so it fits into their day/week/month and shift other “less important” tasks around. Have you ever REALLY looked at how you spend your time? Someone who is exceedingly efficient at managing their time will increasingly fill their time with “high return” activities, squeezing out the “low return” activities with an end result of a much higher level of productivity. THAT is how the busy people GET THINGS DONE!IF you want to be successful and IF you have that great attitude then the next thing you can focus on that will have the best return for your career is Time Management. It’s not an overnight fix, it is truly a lifelong learning exercise but it is worth it. You can read a few of our past posts on Time Management here.Being able to get things done will not only help you do more for your client, you’ll eventually be able to take on more contracts and, ultimately, increase your revenue stream! The question is, are you willing to put in the extra effort it takes and change some routines to achieve that goal?Print Friendly VersionLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
