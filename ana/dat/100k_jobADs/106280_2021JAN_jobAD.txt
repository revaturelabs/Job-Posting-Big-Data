(no paid jobs, sorry, this is a free project). We may not be able to use you right away until more of the story is implemented, but when your voice is needed, we need you to be active and ready.Requirements:- Be at least 22+ years of age, the older the better (if you are younger, but you think your voice is good, send us samples)- Having a deeper raspy voice naturally, or, for example if you are a smoker- Can perform different accents/vocal tones and can take direction when needed for script reads- Have a good mic (i.e. condenser mic with a pop filter and low noise recording atmosphere).The rest of the stuff, such as effects, and extras will be added at LiquidBronze’s studio. All files should be sent raw, as high quality MP3’s. Voice actors should send at least 4-5 takes so the best can be used from that.Test phrases: (choose one which fits for you the best)Duty NPC: (sorrow, a little nervous) Damn mutants! Those were some of my best men, keep investigating the area; I need to know what happened to them!Military NPC (stern, rough voice): This area is off limits, if you want to get in, you need to convince me first!Scientist NPC: A message to all personal, mutant attacks have become more frequent, so I have been forced to lock the doors to the lab, the code is XXXX (any number)Finally:If you feel you have all the requirements, record a test sample and send it to dezovoiceauditions@yahoo.com, and we will reply as soon as possible!38 Comments to “Voice Actors”September 12, 2012 at 9:42 amEntdranor says:	Are you guys still looking?Log in to ReplyMarch 5, 2012 at 10:32 pmLtTaylor says:	Have to ask, are you still taking auditions? I can see it’s been awhile, but I’m just wondering, I just found this and I’d love to see if I could fit the bill to help this kind of thing out.Log in to ReplyMarch 6, 2012 at 4:53 amLiquidBronze says:	You may still send in auditions! Thanks :)Log in to ReplyDecember 2, 2011 at 12:56 ammelech874 says:	quick question do you mind if i change the wording from Duty NPC: (sorrow, a little nervous) D**n mutants! Those were some of my best men, keep investigating the area; I need to know what happened to them!toCursed mutants! (everything else is the same as the sentence above)the reason I ask this is that i do not profane but i have the deep man’s voice that you are looking for I am 21 and my voice is pretty deep. I can send you my voice in the next two weeks- three weeks.( the reason I have exams coming up in the next 2 weeks for college)Log in to ReplyDecember 2, 2011 at 4:12 pmLiquidBronze says:	That would be fine, thanks! :)Log in to ReplyNovember 7, 2011 at 12:08 amSamMosley says:	Send you some… thanks for the chance!Log in to ReplyNovember 8, 2011 at 8:45 pmLiquidBronze says:	Thanks!

We are using people with Russian accents, or people that can perform a Russian accent. You are more then welcome to audition using some of the test phrases above though, thanks!Log in to ReplyAugust 23, 2011 at 12:56 pmCzechDeath says:	I kinda need some better mic for things like this….under 100€. If anyone can help me a bit to choose mic which would be suitable. please do so.Of course I already went trought “Just GOOGLE it LOLZ!” part… and Im only confused. I don’t even know which tipe of mic I sould pick… not much are for spoken word, and if there are, prices are around 1 000€ and thats OMFG too much =(Log in to ReplyAugust 23, 2011 at 1:33 pmCzechDeath says:	I found this one…. looks good sofar http://www.studioprojectsusa.com/b1.htmlLog in to ReplyAugust 23, 2011 at 5:59 pm0235 says:	yeah, im currently using my camcorder as a mic, which is sterio, but like you said, all i can here in the background is my noisy computer. make sure that they have accepted you before buying the mic (though the more people, the better)Log in to ReplyAugust 23, 2011 at 7:21 pmCzechDeath says:	Yea Im currently in “round two” =D Im just looking because I know that my mic is shitty, so IF they will use me, I’ll need to buy some better mic… I mean I can practise and get better in voice acting even on shitty mic, but final product should be flawless even as for sound quality, which im gonna need to solve by simply better microphone….Log in to ReplyAugust 23, 2011 at 7:30 pm0235 says:	hmm. you ever thought that maybey you could borrow or use one from maybey a local radio station, or a local college, seeming as i am at uni, i may ask the people at the music department if i can use oneof there decent mics, you may even be able to convince a company to let you borrow one and mention in the credits the brand of microphone usedLog in to ReplyAugust 24, 2011 at 12:36 amCzechDeath says:	Oh promoting company =) thats interesing idea, how ever that doesnt seem like fast solution. With that borrow Idea, I Cant think of anyone who is interested in audio recording/or works at studio. My father has musican hobby, but he dont want to borrow me his mic, so he borrowed me his cheap ass backup mic. And his quality backup he gave away mo long lost brother for beatboxing… As you said I sont even know If they can use me . So I’ll just let ti cool, until I know more.August 23, 2011 at 6:28 am0235 says:	ok, im definately going to give this a try, is it ok to put on a russian accent, even though im English? or are you also looking for some good old british folk?Log in to ReplyAugust 23, 2011 at 6:09 amChiff says:	Do you need a voice actor for Barkeep? I can do his voice pretty well.Log in to ReplyAugust 22, 2011 at 9:04 pmDarius6 says:	I was considering on participating to the auditions. I guess an Zoom H2 digital recorder/mic will be sufficient for recording the dialog?Log in to ReplyAugust 26, 2011 at 6:33 pmLiquidBronze says:	Darius6, go ahead and record some test samples from the lines above, the Zoom H2 should offer quality recordings, but I will need to hear then, thanks!Log in to ReplyAugust 20, 2011 at 2:53 pmCzechDeath says:	OK I sent you my voice samples =D I hope you can use me, I enjoyed to create them =)Log in to ReplyJuly 14, 2011 at 7:28 pmyayo says:	This audition would actually be much more effective if you provided some text sample that auditioners should interpret. Mics? AKG, Shoeps, Shure, you name it I got it.Log in to ReplyJuly 14, 2011 at 8:30 pmLiquidBronze says:	Good point^ I will see about getting it updated.
