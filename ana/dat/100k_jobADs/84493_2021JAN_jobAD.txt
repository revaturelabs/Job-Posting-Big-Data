Mechanical ventilation assists gas exchange but causes ventilation induced lung injury (VILI) and impedes recovery.OUR APPROACH AND FINDINGS: A unique method of determining surface tension in edematous alveoli of isolated rat lungs led us to (i) find that VILI is attributable to heterogeneous lung mechanics, and proportional to surface tension, and (ii) discover that a fluorescent dye has the ability to lower surface tension, improve oxygenation and reduce VILI.QUALIFICATIONS: Preference will be given to applicants who have experience with small animal surgery and/or a background in pulmonary, cardiovascular or neuro physiology.-Research staff applicants should have prior laboratory research experience.-Postdoctoral fellow applicants should hold a Ph.D. in physiology, biomedical engineering or a closely related discipline.THE PI: Carrie E. Perlman, Ph.D., trained in mechanical engineering at MIT and biomedical engineering at Northwestern University. She was a postdoctoral fellow in pulmonary physiology at Columbia University. She is an Associate Professor in Biomedical Engineering at Stevens, where she runs the BME Ph.D. program, and serves as a standing member of a NIH study section.LAB WEBSITE: personal.stevens.edu/~cperlman/lungmechanics.htmlTHE ENVIRONMENT: Stevens, in the small city of Hoboken, NJ, provides a multidisciplinary research training environment. The beautiful campus is located on the Hudson River, directly opposite and 10 minutes by train or ferry from lower Manhattan.CONTACT INFORMATION: Interested candidates should email Dr. Perlman at cperlman@stevens.edu, and attach a CV.NOTES:2 openings.Create a Job Alert for Similar JobsAbout Stevens Institute of TechnologyStevens is an equal opportunity employer that is building a diverse faculty, staff and student body and strongly encourages applications from female and minority candidates as well as veterans and individuals with disabilities.
