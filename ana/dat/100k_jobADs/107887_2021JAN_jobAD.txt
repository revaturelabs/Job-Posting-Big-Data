It had everything I could have asked for! It was fast and busy, but I had help if I needed it. It was within my budget, but I never felt like the effort put forth toward my education was cheap.Kristin helped me prepare for exactly what I needed to get into the work force, and because I worked hard, I got a dental assistant job before graduating! A small class meant more focus on individuals, and I made some friends that I hope I keep in contact with.– says Cajsa S., Baker City ORShare this:September 15th, 2016Written by Dental Assistant,2 Comments »Filed under: Reviews« Dream Come TrueDental Assistant Training – Do You Have What it Takes? »2 Responses to “Dental Assistant Job Before Graduating!”Allen S. says:	February 24, 2017 at 1:57 pm	Its always nice to see that students do in fact get jobs after graduation.
