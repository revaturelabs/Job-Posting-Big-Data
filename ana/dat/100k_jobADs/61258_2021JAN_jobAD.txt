We argue that the successor to ESIF should continue to have a focus on supporting economic growth and social cohesion, operating at a local level. HEIs should play an important role in the ESIF successor to achieve these outcomes.Tags: Ambition, Brexit, Research and innovation	Share ArticleFilter by TopicsFilter by TagAmbition (126)Brexit (27)Common good (105)COVID-19 (34)Economy and society (34)Employability, enterprise and entrepreneurship (31)Equality & Diversity (6)Equality and diversity (17)Funding (43)Governance (10)International (45)Politics (22)Research and innovation (44)Schools (5)Students (77)Teaching & Quality (3)Teaching, learning and quality (14)Trust (28)Widening access (39)Filter by MonthJune (9)March (9)December (6)November (14)October (14)May (15)April (11)February (11)January (16)September (19)August (14)July (11) Filter by Year2020 (14)2019 (20)2018 (29)2017 (22)2016 (38)2015 (21)2014 (5)Our OfficeUniversities ScotlandHolyrood Park House106 Holyrood RoadEdinburghEH8 8AS0131 226 1111Universities Scotland is a Scottish charity, SC029163, regulated by the Scottish Charity Regulator (OCSR).SectionsStudy in ScotlandCampaignsMember UniversitiesGet in touchBite-size briefingsWebsite AccessibilityPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsCookie PolicyFollow UsSubscribe to our NewsletterSubscribeVisit one of Scotland’s UniversitiesAbertayUniversity University ofAberdeen University ofDundee University ofEdinburgh Edinburgh NapierUniversity University ofGlasgow Glasgow CaledonianUniversity Glasgow School of Art Heriot-WattUniversity University of the Highlands and Islands Open University in Scotland Queen Margaret University Edinburgh Robert GordonUniversity Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Scotland’s Rural College University of St Andrews University ofStirling University ofStrathclyde University of the West Of Scotland"
