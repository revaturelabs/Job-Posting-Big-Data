"Usual Shit & Brain Sick: New Jobskip to main | skip to sidebarUsual Shit & Brain SickYou know those random brain wave patterns, boring stories and general ramblings that you find hysterical but most of your friends don't.Well this is my publicised version of all of those and more usual shit and brain sick.Friday, October 09, 2015New JobI’VE GOT A JOB!I’m unsure how I feel about it.In the past four weeks, I have had various interviews with agencies and companies, most notably:For a famous family which required a NDA to be signed for the interview, I’ve probably already said too much!For an investment company which was nice but I totally failed the tests, however they liked me and wanted a second interview, which is super nice.For another investment firm that had a double act interview me, I wasn’t keen on this and it came through the agency I didn’t really like. I had such pleasure telling him that I’d been offered a job elsewhere when he tried to let me down gently, jerk!And then for the company who have offered me a role, which is based on Euston Road and seemed relatively normal and nice.It’s for a good firm, with a little ego, with normal people and a reasonable pay package, good holiday allowance and extras attached (not that extras have ever bothered me before?).I start next Monday.Posted by Pipsywoo at 12:42 PMNo comments:Post a CommentNewer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)About MePipsywooMe, umm....well there's lots but you'll find that all out eventually. I'm a fan of simple things and small gestures.View my complete profileBlog Archive► 2019 (1)► March (1)► 2018 (5)► July (1)► June (2)► May (2)► 2017 (11)► October (1)► June (1)► April (2)► March (1)► February (4)► January (2)► 2016 (27)► December (2)► November (1)► September (2)► August (1)► July (2)► June (1)► May (5)► April (1)► March (5)► February (3)► January (4)▼ 2015 (36)► December (2)► November (4)▼ October (3)Joining the Gym34.4% FatNew Job► September (1)► August (2)► July (5)► June (4)► May (1)► April (2)► February (4)► January (8)► 2014 (40)► December (3)► November (1)► August (1)► July (4)► June (2)► May (7)► April (4)► March (4)► February (8)► January (6)► 2013 (39)► December (2)► November (3)► October (7)► September (4)► August (6)► July (5)► June (3)► April (1)► March (3)► February (2)► January (3)► 2012 (24)► December (5)► October (1)► September (3)► August (1)► June (6)► May (1)► April (1)► March (4)► February (1)► January (1)► 2011 (60)► December (2)► November (3)► October (2)► September (7)► August (10)► July (7)► June (4)► May (2)► April (4)► March (6)► February (7)► January (6)► 2010 (42)► December (2)► November (1)► October (3)► September (1)► August (6)► July (2)► June (3)► May (8)► April (3)► March (3)► February (6)► January (4)► 2009 (103)► December (3)► November (14)► October (12)► September (7)► August (3)► July (10)► June (7)► May (10)► April (8)► March (4)► February (11)► January (14)► 2008 (34)► December (8)► November (4)► October (3)► September (7)► August (1)► July (2)► June (1)► May (2)► April (1)► March (1)► January (4)► 2007 (55)► December (3)► November (5)► October (6)► September (1)► August (4)► July (1)► June (2)► May (1)► April (6)► March (12)► February (6)► January (8)► 2006 (12)► December (5)► November (2)► October (4)► September (1)"
