When I was a kid, for sure… but in those days people could actually afford to take their kids to a game, as the teams were not burdened by paying obscene salaries to bonus baby prima donnas. There were people like Sandy Koufax, Bart Starr or Gordie Howe who were gentlemen as well as athletes. These were players that parents would feel good about their sons wanting to emulate.Besides, amateur sports are more fun. Folks are more charged up, and the teams are playing their hearts out for the love of the game… although, to be sure, some are looking for a shot at the pros.In terms of football, cardinal and gold have been my team’s colours since 1979, when I started school at the University of Southern California. But the red and gold colour hit much closer to home with the Sarnia Imperials, and I sure wish I could be in the stands at Norm Perry Park Saturday as they clinch the western division.As I write this, I’m looking at a picture of Norm Perry, along with his teammates who were the Senior ORFU Champions from 1929 to 1932. (The photo is also in the Sarnia Lambton Sports Hall of Fame).They’re a rugged bunch of guys, and by today’s standards quite a bit smaller. Today the average NFL Lineman is 6’5” and weighs 310 pounds. My grandfather, Tom Scharf, was 5’10” and perhaps 240 pounds at his heaviest.But those guys from decades ago look as hard as nails and they show evidence of the fact that they played with leather helmets without facemasks.The Imperials was a company team. The Great Depression was on, and while no one made any money playing football, they had a job at the Imperial Oil refinery. My grandfather was a pipefitter. I would imagine, in those hard times, that the Sarnia games gave locals something to believe in.Playing football in the Ontario summer has to be nasty, but had the season been spring/summer back in the day, perhaps we’d have taken one more Grey Cup. I was told that the Grey Cup Game against the Toronto Argonauts took place in some nasty weather. Norm Perry went in for a touchdown, but it was a hard call because the boundary line was partially covered with snow. The ref, being a very ethical guy, and a Sarnian, did not want to be guilty of making a home-town decision, called the touchdown back, and the Argos took the Grey Cup.I’ve forgotten the official’s name, but my uncle told me that he was pretty unpopular for a few years afterward.As I look at those young, tough athletes, all in their prime… Perry, Aiken, Reeves, McPhedran, Baker... not one of the 29 is still with us. My grandfather posthumously received the Earl Mackenzie Award in 2001; he died in 1939. If I was to be able to sit in the stands Sunday night, I’d know I’d feel his presence, and frankly, I think that entire championship team will be present somehow.Sarnia Imperials, you’ve got a proud history. Kick some Steeler butt Saturday night. I know you can do it!Gregory Scharf was born and raised in Sarnia and lives in Southern CaliforniaWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.Try refreshing your browser.During the Depression, football team offered jobs and hope Back to videoAdvertisementAdvertisementThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Share this article in your social networkShare this Story: During the Depression, football team offered jobs and hopeCopy LinkEmailFacebookTwitterRedditPinterestLinkedInTumblrNews Near SarniaThis Week in FlyersArticle CommentsCommentsPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion and encourage all readers to share their views on our articles.
