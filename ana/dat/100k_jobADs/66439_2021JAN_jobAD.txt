One night meeting with Lenore Mewton changed my life and career. She was able to break me down to my true essence or passion. During my career, I was happiest when I was working with young people on a sports talk show for kids. I had always wanted to teach and coach young people, and her advice and guidance gave me the confidence I needed to pursue my dream of starting my first business. I was so concerned about how I was going to make a living I had lost my way to finding my true self. Lenore gave me the mental support and confidence I needed. Interestingly over the past 19 months in business, I have been told by investors, that the passion I have for my dream is one of my greatest assets. Lenore unleashed that passion and now the sky is the limit.
