NewsQuantic Dream has to pay $7.8k to former employeeView moreNewsJob NewsCompanyQuantic DreamDecember 3rd, 2019 - 08:52amBy Alex Calvin, Editor - PC Games InsiderFrench games developer Quantic Dream has been ordered to pay out €7,000 ($7,756) to a former member of staff over its working culture.As reported by Le Monde - and spotted by Gamasutra - the Heavy Rain maker has had to compensate an ex-employee for the crude images what were circulated around its offices. The former employee was also after a wrongful termination status for their leaving the company due to said working conditions, but this was not granted.“By remaining passive in the face of this more than questionable practice, which can not be justified by the ‘humorous’ spirit prevailing in society, the employer has committed a breach of the security obligation [vis-à-vis its employees],” the judge is reported as saying.Quantic Dream will not appeal the verdict and has said it is pleased that the ex-employee had not been able to claim wrongful termination owing to the studio's working culture. The David Cage-headed operation took this as a vindication of the press reports into what being employed at the Beyond: Two Souls studio was like.Of course, Quantic Dream lost a lawsuit on this exact subject in July 2018. The company started suing French media over reports of its toxic working culture in April of that year. Said accusations were published in January 2018, with Quantic Dream saying that this was a \"smear campaign.\"All this negative PR didn't stop Chinese games firm NetEase investing in the Paris-based developer at the start of 2019.Tags:Job Newstoxicfranceparisworking cultureAlex CalvinEditor - PC Games InsiderAlex Calvin is a freelance journalist who writes about the business of games.
