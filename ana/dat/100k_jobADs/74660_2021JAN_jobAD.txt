Upload all Accounts in our spreadsheet to Zoho2.	Add data from the ‘special’ fields in the spreadsheet if possible so we do not lose it3.	Take the contacts in the spreadsheet (currently in the account row) and upload to Zoho so they link to their Accounts4.	Take the Notes from the second tab in the spreadsheet and upload to the Accounts Note field.I attach as sample of our spreadsheet so please ask any questions you may have.The task is to be carried out on Saturday and the final spreadsheet will be sent out late on Friday after the end of the working day, so we can change to the new CRM over during the weekend.I will also be looking for someone who can give ongoing assistance with our learning and setting it up. Please confirm that you do have expertise in ZOHO and send some screen shots if you have any to show this.Many thanksAnthonyPS I have put a fixed price but am open to your suggestions as to an agreeable price.Anthony L.100% (10)Projects Completed9Freelancers worked with9Projects awarded45%Last project29 Nov 2020United KingdomNew ProposalLogin to your account and send a proposal now to get this project.Log inClarification Board Ask a QuestionThere are no clarification messages.Ends in (days)27Fixed Price£50(approx. $68)- or -Post a project like thisAnthony L.100% (10)Projects Completed9Freelancers worked with9Projects awarded45%Last project29 Nov 2020United KingdomRelated project Searchescrm development enterprise resource planning (erp) zoho crmProductAboutTeamCareersBlogSupportHow it worksTrust & SafetyHelp CentreDiscoverPeoplePerHour PlusAcademyResourcesCustomer StoriesBusiness Cost CalculatorStartup CitiesBrowseFreelance ServicesFreelance Services By CountryFreelance SkillsTermsPrivacy© 2021 People Per Hour LtdWe use cookies to improve your experience and our services.
