My career coach had prepared thoroughly for our meeting and showed me jobs with specific employers that I'd not even considered. These will make good use of my transferable skills. She also pointed out a few errors in my CV which I will now correct. I feel very hopeful that I can take my career in a new direction and I know how to implement an effective job search for my next opportunity.\"Rachel K, HR Specialist\"At my Career Options and Job Search Consultation with CareerBalance my career coach showed me a job that she thought I should apply for. I went home and made my application. I was successful and have been working for this company for several months. I would never have found this opportunity on my own.\"“I just wanted to email to say thank you for my programme proposal and your advice. As a result of it, I managed to get a job at the General Dental Council which I would never have looked at without your advice, so thank you. An worthwhile appointment. I thought I'd just let you know and to say thank you for your assistance.\"Shaun Round, BarristerSome Of The Organisations Our Clients Work ForLet’s Discuss Your Needs.We Can Help You To Find A New Career Direction That Fulfills And Interests You.Send Message NowCall Us Today20 Little Britain | London EC1A 7DHTel: 0203 051 1054Email: [email protected]Quick LinksBook a consultationAbout UsCase StudiesJob ResearchLatest BlogsHow To Harness Social Media For Your Job SearchSocial NetworksFacebookLinkedinAll rights reserved by CareerBalance Limited | Site designed by Savvy SEO | Terms & Conditions | Privacy Policy	Go to Top"
