Settlers from nearby provinces migrated to Kowloon throughout the Ming dynasty.8 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !EconomistdbddMany years ago, Hongkong was a place governed by corrupted Qing emperor.British came, and asked HKer whether they want to join U.K. in return, they brought HK capitalism, Democracy, technology, and wealth. Under British’s rule, HK became one of the most developed place in Asia and even in the world.Until in 1997, CCP saw it, and CCP wanted the rich HK back. After negotiations and threats, they got HK from U.K. in 1997. However? Hong Kong people don’t want to become a part of CCP, like they don’t want to be part of the old corrupted Qing dynasty.Now, CCP wants to turn HK from UK-like to NK-like city.Lol. The UK did not bring Democracy and if they gave the peasants control of the colonial government through voting it would have remained undeveloped.8 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist2127In HK, nightlife business-a shady industry—employs Indians, bcz in better wallks of life, they are discriminated against.Btw, do you remember the Indian wife of the British author, who died in a HK hospital, bcz doctors neglected her due to color:“Jacques moved to Hong Kong with Variah and nine-month-old Ravi. In 2000, Veriah was sent to a hospital after suffering a grand mal seizure. While at the hospital, Veriah complained to Jacques that she was treated as “the bottom of the pile,” which Jacques believed was her way of saying that she was suffering from racial discrimination. Variah passed away the next day. Overcome with grief, Jacques was unable to work on his book. He did not write for five years.”http://nwasianweekly.com/2010/06/‘when-china-rules-the-world’-a-love-story/A tiny percentage of HK is Indian, a colonial legacy.

I think Xi's policy is backwards and I worry about a \"one country one system\" outcome.My questions for the HKBro are: what's your solution? What are the lessons learned from previous protests?I wish I have answers for you but I don't. But there are two thoughts I want to share with you:1. HKers are HKers. I think it's a valuable opposition voice to CCP. But do you have to make that point by saying you prefer being British colony?2. Please remember there are mainlanders who don't like the CCP way of doing things either. Why treat us as if we are enemies too? Tiananmen tragedy happened 30 years before you. In fact, I would even join your protests today--but no masks (in pre-covid sense of the world). I don't recall anyone at Tiananmen wore a mask. And, at Tiananmen, no subway was being set on fire by protesters.Dude the current generation of hkers above 25 were all born British subjects. Isn't it natural they have some deep feelings for their lives under the British who did rule with a very light hand, provided a decent system, had a large impact on hk culture (you can see the food, language, road names, education were all influenced by the British) and treated the hkers well and mostly as an equal after 1960s.HK has probably exceeded the most parts of the UK in terms of standards of living (maybe except london).London has the worst standard of living in the UK. The cost of living and crime are horrible. Normal people cannot afford to live there anymore.8 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist2127Racism against Indian death in HK:https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/31/hospital-pays-compensation-racism-deathHKers are colonials who cope with their colonial complexes thru harassing mainland Chinese, Indians, and also South East Asian maids.Then they act slavishly towards Westerners, motivated by the same colonial psychology.8 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 2 No Jab !EconomistdbddRacism against Indian death in HK:https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/31/hospital-pays-compensation-racism-deathHKers are colonials who cope with their colonial complexes thru harassing mainland Chinese, Indians, and also South East Asian maids.Then they act slavishly towards Westerners, motivated by the same colonial psychology.If your people weren’t weak maybe they would not have been colonized and maybe you would be in India instead of seeking employment in other countries demanding special treatment?8 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist1fa3The Indian community in HK is historic, brought in by the English, apparently to police over cunning Chinese.But to return to your point, if Indians are weak and deserve discrimination, Hkers are weak and deserve mainland rule.8 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !« Previous1…45Topic ClosedThis topic has been closed to new replies.Economics Job Market Rumors | Job Market | Conferences | Employers | Journal Submissions | Links | Privacy | Contact | Night ModeDefault Personality Textbook In the Club Rouge Mod Old Krug New Krug Kentucky NuSchool UKAP Sturmy Weather Not Brogues The Real Cambridge Lee Kuan Blue Beethoven Honkers Tokyo Drift Concert Hall Don't Pluck with the Chuck Troll Farm"
