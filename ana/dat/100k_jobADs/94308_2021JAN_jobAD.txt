Great work Advance Group, keep it up!Thomas L. | Plant SupervisorI just wanted to let you know, that this is my first time using a Staffing Agency. I worked with your staffing specialist Renee (Monroe, Michigan Office) and she was fantastic. I got a job with her right away. I really appreciate her professional manner, she was very respectful and courteous. She did a great job and I just wanted to let you know that.Carla BrusseauAdvance Staffing Solutions found me the perfect job. I am thankful every day that they helped me transition from military life back into a civilian career. Thank you!!Curtis HareI worked for Advance for around 5 months. Jordan was the individual who I dealt with when I first came in the office looking for work. She was extremely polite, and answering all of my questions at the time. The most important part of all, I was working almost immediately! But it doesn’t stop there. The first assignment I was sent on ended up not being a match for me. I let Jordan know the issue and was sent to a new assignment. This turned out to be a fantastic fit for me. So well, that the company selected me out of all of their contract employees, to become part of their team. Even though I’m no longer a part of Advance Staffing, I wouldn’t have the great job that I have now without the help. I have used several staffing agencies before, and this was BY FAR the greatest experience.Rick SolisI am writing to both endorse and recommend Advance Staffing Solutions as an all-encompassing provider of staffing solutions.

Shortly after I completed my initial application they had me interviewing for positions in my field. During my search I asked them to help me find something temporary until I could find a permanent position to support my family. Within 2 days I had a temporary job and within 2 months of that they had me interview for a permanent position, in my field, that met my salary requirements, with a prominent company. I would absolutely recommend the staff at Advanced Staffing – they’re friendly, responsive and effective.J. FreyAdvance Staffing Solution made it easy to find a better paying job quickly. I was hired in a position after a week with the agency and they worked around my schedule to find me a great job that I am still with and that I actually like doing.
