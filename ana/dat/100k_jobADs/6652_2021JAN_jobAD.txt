Do they usually pay for the accommodation?Any help is appreciated.Thanks.Back to topibasiramJoined: 24 Mar 2003Posts: 107Posted: Wed Jul 23, 2003 3:28 pm Post subject:Hi,I have heard of them. In fact, I was offered a job by them, I think it was in January. To be honest I didn't really pay much attention to their offer, because I had just got myself sorted at the time with my own job.They're quite new to the scene, I think. I forget how much they pay, or if accommodation is included. They're in Wroclaw, which is a big city, as you probably know, so you should be looking for at least 2,500PLN - 2800PLN with accommodation provided, Wroclaw is big, and big is usually more expensive.All the best,Enjoy Poland. It's great.Back to topbnixJoined: 16 Jan 2003Posts: 645Posted: Wed Jul 23, 2003 10:48 pm Post subject: WroclawEnjoy Poland.It IS great.Well,maybe except Warsaw. In my opinion,Wroclaw is one of the nicest cities in Poland.And it is certainly no more expensive than Warsaw or Krakow. Have a great time.Back to topDisplay posts from previous: All Posts1 Day7 Days2 Weeks1 Month3 Months6 Months1 Year Oldest FirstNewest FirstJob Discussion Forums Forum Index -> Poland All times are GMTPage 1 of 1Jump to: Select a forum Where to Begin----------------General DiscussionNewbie ForumCurrent Events ForumTechnology ForumOnline Teaching Forum Africa Forums----------------General Africa Forum Asia Forums----------------CambodiaChina (Job-related Posts Only)China (Off-Topic)Hong KongIndiaIndonesiaJapanMalaysiaPhilippinesSingaporeTaiwanThailandGeneral Asia ForumVietnam Caribbean Forums----------------General Caribbean Forum Europe Forums----------------Czech RepublicFranceGermanyGreeceItalyMacedonia and the BalkansPolandRomaniaRussia & C.I.S.SpainTurkeyUkraineUnited KingdomGeneral Europe Forum Latin America Forums----------------ArgentinaBrazilChileColombiaCosta RicaMexicoMexico (off-topic)PeruGeneral Latin America Forum The Middle East Forums----------------BahrainEgyptIsraelKuwaitOmanQatarSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesGeneral Middle East Forum North America Forums----------------General North America Forum Oceania----------------Australia/New ZealandYou cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forumThis page is maintained by the one and only Dave Sperling.Contact Dave's ESL CafeCopyright © 2018 Dave Sperling.
