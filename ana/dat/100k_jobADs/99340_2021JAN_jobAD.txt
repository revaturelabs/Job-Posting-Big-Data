MAN Truck & Bus is now modifying its truck and component production capacity due to current market developments and economic forecasts: the daily production figures are being reduced at the truck plants in Munich, Steyr, and Krakow, as well as the component sites in Nuremberg and Salzgitter.In Munich, Steyr, Nuremberg, and Salzgitter, this will be in the form of longer cycles, with the Krakow plant also running one shift instead of two. Individual shutdown days and shift cancellations have been announced for the MAN engine plant in Nuremberg in the 4th quarter of 2019. Weekend shifts will be avoided. These measures will result in fewer subcontracted employees working at the production sites mentioned above.Joachim Drees, Chief Executive Officer of MAN Truck & Bus SE and member of the TRATON SE Executive Board, says: “We are seeing an ongoing slowdown in the European truck market and thus a significant drop in orders, especially for heavy-duty trucks. We expect the European truck market to decline by around 10 to 20% in the coming year compared to 2019. As long as our 2020 expectations prove to be accurate, we plan to make adjustments to our production without resorting to short-time working. Given this deteriorating market environment, it is becoming all the more important for us to continue working on improving our earnings power. This gives us the freedom to be able to invest in new technologies and business models. Despite all the challenges within the market, we intend to strengthen our competitive standing next year with our new generation of trucks.”Saki Stimoniaris, Chairman of the Group Works Council, says: “Our industry is an incredibly cyclical one – that much is not new. With this in mind, the Works Council may have to enter into agreements with the employer regarding production adjustments should the order situation require this. In doing so, we as a workforce play our part in ensuring that MAN remains strong and competitive in the future. However, one thing is clear: our employees’ interests must always be taken into account as part of this process!”Tags # Haulage NewsTweet	Share	Pin it	WhatsappComment	Haulage NewsBy Truckingjobs.co.uk at November 06, 2019Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels: Haulage NewsNo comments:Post a commentNewer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)Follow by EmailFollow us on social mediafacebook count=31k;Followerstwitter count=1.3k;Followersinstagram count=828;FollowersSearch Driving Jobs7.5 tonne driver jobsClass 1 Driver JobsClass 2 (CAT C) Driver JobsSearch Jobs by LocationEast Anglia Driver JobsEast Midlands Driver JobsIreland Driver JobsLincolnshire Driving JobsNorth East Driver JobsNorth West Driver JobsNorthern Ireland Driver JobsScotland Driver JobsSouth East Driver JobsSouth West Driver JobsWales Driver JobsWest Midlands Driver JobsYorkshire Driver JobsLatest NewsDAF Trucks (65)Dealer News (14)Fleet News (324)Haulage News (339)Haulage Products (6)HGV Driver Advice (34)HGV Operator Advice (4)IVECO Trucks (44)MAN Trucks (33)Mercedes Trucks (156)Renault Trucks (27)Scania Trucks (94)Technology News (219)Truck Crime (10)Volvo Trucks (145)Quick Search Jobs7.5 tonne driver jobs (5) Class 1 Driver Jobs (551) Class 2 (CAT C) Driver Jobs (185)Connect With usFollow usCareers IndexBuilders Merchant JobsCourier HGV Driver JobsSupermarket Driver Job IndexTop 100 Haulage CompaniesOur PartnersHaulageHQContact formNameEmail *Message *Contact formNameEmail *Message *Copyright © TruckingJobs.co.uk"
