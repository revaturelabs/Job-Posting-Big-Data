I thought it was really easy. We arent allowed to tell you what they ask or what it is about... but in my opinion I thought it was easy and that is also what I've heard from others.

I had to resend my finger prints and it won't arive in unitll Sept 1(Who knows when they'll process them). I also had to redo an x-ray on 8/25. I was told by the med office that took the x-ray that they won't send cbp the results untill the end of this week or next week. DHS told me that once the med officer receive them, it could take 4-6 weeks to be forarded.

I'm not a budget analyst, but there doesn't seem to be much correlation between the budget status and hiring activity. If DHS wants to move forward with hiring, they'll find the resources to do so. If an area isn't a priority, it will wait. Any downswing in hiring toward the end of a given year is probably more related to the coming holidays.CommentPostCancelArewethereyetU.S. Coast GuardJoin Date: Jun 2007Posts: 851ShareTweet#2554008-29-2011, 11:33 AMOriginally posted by Mich-Again View PostI've been in this process for a couple of years and have watched budget issues come and go.

If this was the case, then why doesn't the Coast Guard enlist as many people as possible before September? The budget includes personnel expenses, and if it's a small number, the hiring will be slow.CommentPostCancelayitearyeeForum MemberJoin Date: Aug 2011Posts: 53ShareTweet#2554108-29-2011, 02:28 PMOriginally posted by Mich-Again View PostI've been in this process for a couple of years and have watched budget issues come and go.

There's no if, ands or buts about that. In any agency or company, the budget affects new hires. Simple accounting. Try to get into the Air Force as an officer now. Nearly imposible unless you have an engineering degree (and you still may have to wait for a class). Come Sept 30 all student hires accross the Air Force(and it may be across DOD) will be unemployed also. They were just notified last week. There is also a freeze on all civilian(This is across DOD I think and not just the AF) hires for 90 days for now and may be longer. This is all do to budget shortfalls come Oct 1. New hires are always considered during tough times.This article is not new but it still relates:http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=25504Test: 12/10 (Geo: NJ)New Geo: GA 6/13/11New NOR: 6/14/11TO: 6//15/11..........PendingQUAL:6/28/11.........PendingBI: 6/29/11.............Pending (In Security Office)Fit1: 8/5/11............CompletedVBT/SI: 8/11/11.....CompletedMED: 9/12/11.........CompletedDT: 9/28/11...........CompletedPoly: 11/2/11..........CompletedPoly-2nd: 11/23/11..CompletedFit2: ?EOD: ?CommentPostCancelTopFlightInGAForum MemberJoin Date: Mar 2009Posts: 75ShareTweet#2554208-29-2011, 04:02 PMI believe they can continue to call people up until the end of Sept. So classes can actually can start in October. Next the dates for TDY instructors for the academy are from the end of August to the beginning of March. So classes must be there for them to teach. Also the last class has a date of Sept 27 to Feb 10th \"I think\". So that still gives a couple of weeks to schedule a class or two. Last, correct me if I'm wrong but the new debt commission is not expected to have anything on the budget until sometime in December or January \"again, I'm not quite sure of the month.\" With all that, I believe they will probably pass CRs, until the budget can be worked out. The only thing with the CR's is that the money strictly goes to critical need locations. Check delphi forums and you all can see that people where getting the call late October 2010 but only for southern border locations.CBPOGeo Pref:GeorgiaNOR:3/07T.O:10/081st TSU:6/092nd Fitness test:11/09Credit pulled:4/102nd TSU:5/102nd Medical and 2nd drug test:3/112nd E-Quip and fingerprints:4/112nd Background Investigator:6/6/11All green checks in Cass except background:in security officeCommentPostCancelwilliburnsForum MemberJoin Date: Mar 2011Posts: 37ShareTweet#2554308-29-2011, 05:42 PMNormal operations usually slows down at begining of Fiscal yrs(money spending)VBI & SI Passed letter received 8/26/11I was put on TSU 08/18/2011Last edited by williburns; 08-29-2011, 05:52 PM.CBPOExam: 12/2010GEO: Texas West/N MexicoNOR: Jan 2011TO VRA: 3/2011 El PasoTO: 4/2011 El PasoPre emp : CompletedQualifications: CompletedPT Test: 4/2011 CompletedDrug Screening: not requiredMedical: 4/2011 CompletedBI met w/ investigator 7/14 Completed 8/16VBI: 08/12/2011 letter received 8/27 PassedChange GEO,- Southeast 6/08TSU 8/18/2011CommentPostCancelWaterpistolaForum MemberJoin Date: Mar 2008Posts: 255ShareTweet#2554408-29-2011, 05:52 PManyone else get their CBPO notice of results again today? last time they did that they opened up some locations to change to (priority)CommentPostCancelRipcurrentForum MemberJoin Date: Apr 2011Posts: 6ShareTweet#2554508-29-2011, 06:00 PMYeah, I didn't pass the written exam.
