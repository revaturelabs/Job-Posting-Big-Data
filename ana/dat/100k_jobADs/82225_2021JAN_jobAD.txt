Community and support are essential to well-being, especially in the challenging time that is 2020, and we strive to enjoy every day by focusing on the positives whenever we can.Reuniting thousands of amazing, unique people across the world around a common vision is something we do daily, making sure we’re a great place to grow.Thanks to the contributions and support of our Webhelpers from around the world, it has been an incredible journey. And as passionate game-changers who thrive on making a difference, the participants not only reached our target of 40.075km but went on to reach for the stars.We traveled an incredible 112.968 km, walking, running, biking, rowing and all you can think of, not only around the Earth, but the Moon, Mars and Venus!We’ve always known our Webhelpers are a talented bunch, so we weren’t surprised to see them enjoying so many different forms of exercise throughout September. Check out our highlights reel featuring clips and photographs of our journey here below.https://webhelp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WE-DID-IT-Facebook-Post-2.mp4Our journey doesn’t end here though. This challenge is part of our global WebHEALTH program which focuses on our people’s wellbeing every day and everywhere. We’ll continue to invest in our people and planet through dedicated initiatives, bringing our vision of making business more human to life in everything we do.PrevNextAbout usWhat we doThe GroupWebhelp in your regionDiscoverAll industriesOur solutionsNewsCareerJob searchWork abroadCommunityContact usThink HumanLegal HubGovernance & Risk managementCookie Preference Center© 2020.
