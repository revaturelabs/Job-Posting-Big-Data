Starting a new job can be terrifying, but here’s one thing you need to remember: you’ve earned this place.You’ve done well, you’ve impressed the hiring team, and you have the necessary skill set to be successful in this new career. It’s time to step forward in confidence and know, beyond a doubt, that you are capable.Whether you’re just trying to pump yourself up before the big day, feeling on edge, or having a case of the nerves that, mind you, come naturally with starting a new job, here are some words of advice to inspire you as you begin this new journey.1. Remember both your past and potential.When we start something new, sometimes it’s so easy to forget how far we’ve come. As you prepare yourself, think about all the past jobs, experiences, projects, etc. that you’ve completed or mastered. Remind yourself that you are stronger than you think, but also encourage yourself in remembering that you can, and will, continue to grow.2. Focus on your ‘why.’“Desire! That’s the one secret of every man’s career. Not education. Not being born with hidden talents. Desire.”— Johnny CarsonRemember that at the root of every job, every position, every change is desire. Why are you here? What is it about this job that gets you fired up? Put that at the forefront of your mind as you begin, and let that passion bring you to places far greater than you imagined.3. Consider that starting a new job is an opened door.You’ve probably heard the words, “every closed door leads to an open one” or some sort of variation of those words. What’s powerful (and true) about that phrase is wherever change happens, so does growth. Perhaps you’ve made this career change for a reason, perhaps you were forced to—regardless of the circumstances, see starting a new job as an opportunity.A door somewhere has closed—maybe one that you recognize, or maybe not!—but with the new career, a new door is opened and bringing you new journeys along with it.4. Create where you want to go next.“The best way to predict the future is to create it.”— Abraham LincolnAs you begin this new job, remember that you are in control. Even though you are just starting, you have the potential to grow yourself and the company tremendously, simply by working hard and believing. No one can motivate you, or force you to walk a certain road. Pave one for yourself.5. Always dress your best, while staying true to you.People will tell you that the most important thing to do when starting a new job is to ‘dress to impress.’ While I love that catchy slogan, I don’t fully believe in it. Yes, of course, you always want to adhere to the company guidelines and standards about dress code, but don’t limit yourself.You don’t have to wear something simply because you desire to ‘fit in’ or look a certain way. Within reason, feel free to express yourself and your identity in the office space, while keeping in mind expectations for professionalism.6. Don’t be afraid to speak up.“Do not be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment.”— Ralph Waldo EmersonBeing new doesn’t mean you have to hold back or wait until everyone else has expressed their ideas before you open your mouth. Sure, you may be new, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have excellent points to offer. Perhaps you can bring about an angle that no one thought of, or a perspective that’s never been considered. Don’t be afraid to kindly and appropriately raise your voice.7. Get comfortable with yourself, space, and boss.Don’t let yourself be intimidated—by the space or people around you, by your boss or higher ups, and especially by yourself. There will be things you don’t know or understand, but see those things as learning opportunities instead of weaknesses.Put yourself out there, speak to people in charge of you with respect and confidence, and empower yourself to believe that you are strong and thus worthy of taking up space (you are).8. Be consistent.“You can’t build a reputation on what you’re going to do.” — ConfuciusShow up. Be on time. Do what you’re supposed to do, and if you feel compelled (and you should!) go above and beyond. Don’t worry about the mistakes you make (obviously correct and work on them, of course!) but don’t let yourself be limited by failure.Be bold. Do things, rather than just talk about them. And at the end of the day, make sure you’re being someone who earns their value to the business/company.9. Proofread.If you want to be taken seriously, make sure you take the extra minutes to proofread, edit, revise, and review your work. That goes for anything from emails to blog posts, memos to printed brochures, etc. Nothing screams ‘inadequate’ than being too lazy to put forth the extra effort of revision.10. Enjoy the experience.You’ll soon be overwhelmed with lists, tasks, and esponsibilities, and you might get so caught up that you forget how this all began. Remember, even in the rush of the everyday, to be thankful for where you are and what you have. There will be moments where the job isn’t all that you were promised and days when you’re frustrated, but don’t forget to smile. Celebrate the fact that you have a purpose, and enjoy the experience.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)MoreClick to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Skype (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Tagged: advice for someone starting a new job, career advice, new job, start a new job, starting a new jobWritten by Marisa DonnellyMarisa Donnelly is a Midwest-born, West Coast-based writer/editor, writing coach and teacher.
