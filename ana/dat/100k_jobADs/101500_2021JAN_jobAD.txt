I have had 10 tracks Mastered just recently that i did the mixing for, but it feels as if they are not as clear & loud & punchy as the artists mentioned above & others. I am very curious as to how to get that sound that i want ,and i don't want to waste any more of my time mixing or paying a Mastering service if it is just going to turn out average or get put through a pre set . If it comes down to paying some 1 with years of experience a bit more then so be it .Additional info:Post a job similar to thisor sign up to reply to jobs like thiscloseRefer Glen to another SoundBetter proThe pro will know that you referred Glen, and may then refer clients to youWho would you like to refer?Send referralcloseWhat can we help you with?Tell us more about your project:Need help?
