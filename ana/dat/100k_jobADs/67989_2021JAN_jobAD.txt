More informationSafe As Houses: Linden Homes Site Manager Wins Pride In Job Award (Harvest Meadow)The site manager at Linden Homes Midlands’ Harvest Meadow development in Dunton has been honoured for his professionalism with a national Pride in the Job Quality Award.Carl Haskell, 39 from Langford, Bedfordshire was recognised by judges on the National House Building Council’s programme for his leadership, technical expertise, robust health and safety management – and a certain X Factor.Pride in the Job is one of house building’s most prestigious awards and for the last 33 years it has been run to strengthen standards in the industry.Carl was picked from over 15,000 entrants from around the country for a Quality Award and will now join the shortlist for best in the Southern region and the Seal of Excellence.The results will be announced in the autumn before the national winner is revealed in January 2015.Carl led the team at Harvest Meadow – located in the Bedfordshire village of Dunton, ideally positioned less than four miles from Biggleswade.A small but carefully designed selection of 24 two, three and four-bedroom homes, the sell-out development will provide housing choice for everyone from first time buyers, growing families and those looking for a smaller, more manageable property.Carl said: “Winning this award means a lot to me but it’s been a team effort to maintain such high standards. Without everyone’s commitment we couldn’t achieve a really well run development or deliver top quality homes.“What’s particularly encouraging about this award is that it highlights the determination we have at every step of the way to deliver homes that our customers enjoy living in. It’s really good to have that publicly recognised by the industry.”In the Cambridgeshire area, Linden Homes Midlands’ site manager Kevin Bishop has also won the same award for his work at the Saxon Gardens development at Huntingdon.Linden Homes’ production director Brendan Blythe: “Competition for the NHBC awards is fierce. I am delighted for Carl, Kevin and their teams and that they have been recognised by the NHBC for the high quality of their work. Good luck to the them both in the next stage of the awards.”Pride in the Job for Linden Homes Midlands site managerCarl Haskell who recently hosted a visit to theDunton development by local schoolchildren.-ENDS-For further press information please contact Cetti Long at Media Matters on 01733 371363 or email cetti@mediamatters-pr.co.uk30 June 2014< Back to press officeAll images are used for illustrative purposes only and are representative only.
