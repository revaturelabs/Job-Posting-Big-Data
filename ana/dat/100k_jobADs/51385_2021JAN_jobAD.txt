That means putting plans in place, setting the wheels in motion, closely monitoring initial signals and fine-tuning where necessary, and finally reporting back to the board on progress at regular intervals. This tasks are carried out by a transformation team headed up by a business transformation manager.The BT manager often reports to a business transformation director, but in some corporate structures the manager heads up the transformation and reports directly to the board as a whole. The details of the structure determines what roles the manager performs and how strategically they need to be thinking, i.e. whether they are creating a transformation project or simply implementing one. Either way, the BT manager needs to show the board that the transformation project is being activated to plan, and works alongside analysts and other managers to monitor and forecast its progress.The skills requiredTo land a great business transformation manager role, you need a minimum of experience at a managerial level overseeing a transformation project in an industry similar to the one in which the company operates. However, although experience at managerial level is preferred, team leadership or single-handedly overseeing transformation at a relevant level may be considered more important than the position’s title.Above all, you need to demonstrate that you have the analytical skills required to oversee a project and ensure the wheels keep moving, especially when the terrain gets rough. You need to show that you can delegate effectively and that you have the people skills and the management skills needed to make sure the transformation project progresses as closely as possible to the plan and that the goal and milestones are met.Find Business Transformation Management Jobs with Cast UKCast UK has a great deal of expertise in placing managerial and directorial candidates in business transformation roles for some of the UK’s most forward-thinking companies.
