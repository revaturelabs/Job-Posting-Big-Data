The assumption is that the job has been designed to be rerunnable in case of network interruption. Restartability is a very important & desirable feature of production jobs. You don't want to do diagnostics and \"repair\" each time something happens. You just want to restart so it finishes.Kalman Toth SQL SERVER 2012 & BI TRAININGNew Book: Beginner Database Design & SQL Programming Using Microsoft SQL Server 2012Proposed as answer by Papy Normand Tuesday, April 3, 2012 8:15 PMEdited by Kalman Toth Saturday, October 6, 2012 5:27 AMFriday, March 30, 2012 3:32 PMHelp us improve MSDN.Visit our UserVoice Page to submit and vote on ideas!Make a suggestionDev centersWindowsOfficeVisual StudioMicrosoft AzureMore...Learning resourcesMicrosoft Virtual AcademyChannel 9MSDN MagazineCommunityForumsBlogsCodeplexSupportSelf supportProgramsBizSpark (for startups)Microsoft Imagine (for students)United States (English)NewsletterPrivacy & cookiesTerms of useTrademarks© 2020 Microsoft"
