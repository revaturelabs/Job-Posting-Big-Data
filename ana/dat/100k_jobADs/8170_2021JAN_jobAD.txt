"I‚Äôm leaving my job ¬´ maternalmediaAboutContact meCommunication Design PortfolioHome/Awareness/I‚Äôm leaving my jobI‚Äôm leaving my jobJune 18, 2012It‚Äôs not just a job. It‚Äôs a job in a company that I‚Äôve worked at for 13 years. At a place where I know a few hundred people. A place that employed me before I had kids, heck, before I was even married. I was a wide-eyed graduate fresh out of college who was offered a full-time position after completing an internship. I falsely assumed I would be rich off my humble starting salary.Thirteen years and three kids later, I am far from being monetarily wealthy. However, my life as a whole is richer for having worked there.Yet I knew this time was coming.When I had to put one of my dogs down a couple of summers ago, I told people that I should have made that difficult decision about six months prior than I actually did. I knew he wasn‚Äôt happy merely existing.It‚Äôs a pretty dumb comparison, but that is kind of how I felt about my job. I was merely existing for the last several months. I met deadlines, completed my work, and received feedback. But I was no longer hungry. I owed my company and myself more than that.After I finally decided to reclaim some of my professional passion and eject from auto-pilot, I committed to leaving my employer the right way. To let people know what they‚Äôve meant to me over the years. To wrap up loose ends, say my goodbyes. I am in that process this week.The one person who I wish I could share this latest adventure with is my Grandma Peterson. She left this earth and a void in my heart in January 2008. No one was a bigger supporter of my dreams.She would beg me for business cards every time I took a new position so she could share what I did with her friends at church and distant relatives. I literally had hundreds of business cards printed and never got rid of them so handing her a handful was never a problem. It made her happy and it made me proud.As I tossed my ridiculous amount of business cards in the recycling bin, I couldn‚Äôt help but smile.It‚Äôs a bit scary leaving your comfort zone. But I‚Äôve never been one to shy away from opportunity. Grandma Peterson would have reassured me I will be great at this latest adventure.So I will continue to believe her and forge on.Share Me:Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...RelatedIn Awareness, Family, Inspiration, Love, Memories, Passion, Reflection, Support	Adventure, Grandma, Job, Loss, Opportunity, Remembrance	18 responses to I‚Äôm leaving my jobBrea June 19, 2012 at 8:22 amHeidi, congratulations on your new endeavors.

Another great thought someone shared with me recently that I think is worth repeating: ‚ÄúI learned that the hardest thing to do was to make the choice to leave, rather than have no other choice but to leave, if that makes sense.‚Äùkatemcclafferty June 25, 2012 at 3:40 pmCongrats on getting out of your comfort zone!!!
