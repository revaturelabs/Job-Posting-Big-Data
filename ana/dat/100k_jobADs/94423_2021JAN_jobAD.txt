Besides wasting time, resources and extracting a high cost, employee terminations caused by poor performance, poor team fit, and poor cultural fit often end up in a lawyer’s office. Using the pre-employment assessment reduces these risks and improves the employer’s hiring process.COWIB uses FitFirstJobs. These assessments meet and exceed DOL’s and EEOC’s guidelines. Our FitFirst System even offers an Applicant Tracking System and other features for our employers, job candidates, economic developers, career counselors, educators, and parents. The FitFirst assessment and system is phenomenal.”Eddie Foreman, CEOCentral OK Workforce Investment BoardGovernment Agencies & Employers, Request a Demo Today!Your Name (required)Your Email (required)Company (required)What are Your Hiring Challenges (optional)© Fit First Technologies International, Inc.
