It is also reflected in our recruitment policy, which seeks to employ the best candidates for the job no matter where in the world they are from – including European nationals, both before and after Brexit.At present, any EU nationals starting their employment in the UK before the Brexit date are eligible to apply for Settled Status under the Government’s EU Settlement Scheme. Those arriving after Brexit will be able to apply for a temporary immigration status known as European Temporary Leave to Remain (Euro TLR).Applications for Euro TLR will be made online after arriving in the UK, with successful applicants granted leave to remain for 36 months. After that, anyone wishing to stay longer will have to apply under a new points-based immigration system expected to be put in place from January 2021.This means new EU employees will not need a specific immigration status to work in the UK following a no-deal exit – an EU, EEA or Swiss passport or national identity card will remain sufficient proof of the right to work. You can find out more about the scheme on the Government’s website.Don't see the job you're looking for?Sign up for job alerts or follow us on Twitter for latest updates.
