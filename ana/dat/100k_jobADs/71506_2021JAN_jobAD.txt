With your help, the company committed to a fair process and the workers overwhelmingly voted to join with their fellow grocery workers in Local 700.“Bloomingfoods is part of what I love most about Bloomington,” said Casie Jetter, a Bloomingfoods commissary worker. “I want the co-op to remain strong and successful so that my daughter can some day shop at the same co-op that has remained a staple in our community. Bringing a union to Bloomingfoods will put our co-op one more step ahead of competition in an increasingly competitive market.”In addition to the hard work of UFCW activists and members across the country, members of UFCW 700 and 23 worked hard to support the efforts of the organizing workers on the ground.“This marks the end of our unionizing campaign,” member owner and employee Kaisa Goodman said. “But this is just the beginning of our contract campaign…one thing has ended, but something bigger is about to begin.”Sign Up for On PointEmail Address:*First Name:*Last Name:*Postal Code:*Local Number*Please leave this field blank:* denotes required fieldUpdatesAllies and AffiliatesAFL-CIOICWUCRWDSUCommunityCommunity OutreachEnvironmentFood AccessEducationScholarshipEventsHealth & SafetyHealth CareIndustriesCannabisChemical WorkersGroceryPacking and ProcessingFood ProcessingMeat PackingPoultryRetailLobby DayOn PointLegislation and PoliticsNegotiationsOrganizingResourcesLocal Union ResourcesMember ResourcesReportsShare Graphics and MemesSurveyUFCW CanadaPages2014 UFCW Attorneys’ ConferenceConstituency GroupsHomeOn PointResourcesRight to Work SurveyToolsNeed a Website?New Website Application FormTranslations© 2021 For Local Unions.All rights reserved.Find us onlineBacktotop"
