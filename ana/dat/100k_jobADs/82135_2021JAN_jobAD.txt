"Effective job hunting ‚Äì A Dreamer's LandSkip to contentA Dreamer's LandMenuDiaryBeautyWishlistLondon CallingTravelFitnessEffective job huntingApril 11, 2019If you are still employed while looking for your next move, then lucky you! It always happened to me until very recently. I was unemployed and looking for my next career challenge, my next adventure!Below I am leaving you with some tips that helped me out a lot and they‚Äôd probably work for you too:Brainstorm ‚Äì with friends, with partners, yourself. Yes, I have been speaking to myself during these last 2 months and it helped me to organise my ideas and see clearly. It was a powerful tool to figure out exactly what you want, what jobs you‚Äôd like to go for and what you‚Äôd see yourself doing. Imagine;Organising thoughts and ideas ‚Äì after having some insight on what you‚Äôre looking for is time to think this through (or in my case make lists ‚Äì so helpful!). I‚Äôve had a super broad choice and I had to categorize my thoughts. I have made a list for each day. Because I would like to go for different roles like Team Leader, Community Manager, Customer Success, and because there were a lot of companies I was interested in working for I had to be proactive. See example:Monday: look for Team Leader jobs ‚Äì anything from Indeed to Monster, LinkedIn to Reed.Tuesday: look for Community Manager jobs ‚Äì same platformsWednesday: look for startup companies and check their openings;Network ‚Äì I can‚Äôt stress how important is this topic ‚Äì I would take one day a week just to network. I used to go through my WhatsApp conversations, LinkedIn contacts, anyone I could ask for a recommendation, suggestion or speak. Also, LinkedIn was an awesome tool for me as I‚Äôve used it to approach CEO‚Äôs of companies I‚Äôd like to work for and ask if they had any openings (when their website didn‚Äôt have this info displayed);Avoid procrastinating ‚Äì it‚Äôs so easy to lose focus in the middle of job hunting online. You are connected, you receive notifications, how not to?! It can easily lead to a snowball effect where you are more on webwhatsapp and checking out instagram than actually looking for a job! So, what worked for me was checking social media for breakfast, lunch and during breaks (but just make sure that the balance is greater in searching rather than scrolling üôÇ );Don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself ‚Äì having said that about procrastinating, it‚Äôs ok to read a book or go to the gym for a couple of hours a day. And that will help your mental health and will keep you going strong. You need to disconnect, otherwise to be indoors and focus will drive you mad! I used to have a tendency to panic every time I went to the gym because it was less 2 hours of job hunting, BUT trust me it did help loads.And this is all for today because I didn‚Äôt want to bore you with my tips. I hope you find this useful let me know your thoughts!üáµüáπSe est√£o √† procura do pr√≥ximo desafio profissional enquanto ainda trabalham, sorte a vossa! Foi assim que aconteceu comigo at√© h√° bem pouco tempo. Desta vez, estive desempregada em busca minha pr√≥xima aventura!Vou deixar-vos com algumas dicas que me ajudaram bastante e provavelmente poder√£o tamb√©m fazer uso delas:Brainstorm ‚Äì com amigos, com parceiros, com v√≥s mesmos. Eu tenho falado imenso comigo nestes √∫ltimos 2 meses e tem-me ajudado a organizar as minhas ideias. Na minha opini√£o, √© uma estrat√©gia fant√°stica para perceber exactamente o queria fazer e o tipo de fun√ß√µes que me via a desempenhar. N√£o se limitem a pensar apenas nas vossas compet√™ncias, mas tamb√©m naquilo que gostavam mesmo de fazer!;Organizar as ideias ‚Äì depois de ter todas as ideias ‚Äúem cima da mesa‚Äù √© hora de organizar, planear (ou no meu caso, fazer listinhas ‚Äì para mim, uma ajuda preciosa). Tinha imensas posi√ß√µes √†s quais gostava de me candidatar, nomeadamente Chefe de Equipa, Community Manager, Gestora de Clientes e, porque haviam imensas empresas para as quais gostava de trabalhar, tive que tra√ßar um plano semanal! Vejam o exemplo:Segunda-feira: procurar trabalhos como Chefe de Equipa ‚Äì no LinkedIn e em todos os motores de busca que se usam em Londres (Monster, Reed, Indeed)Ter√ßa-feira: procurar trabalhos como Community ManagerQuarta-feria: procurar empresas startup e ver as posi√ß√µes que t√™m dispon√≠veis;Network ‚Äì esta foi provavelmente a revela√ß√£o da minha procura de trabalho. Todas as semanas dedicava tamb√©m um dia s√≥ para networking, comunicar com pessoas que eu acreditava que me podiam ajudar a encontrar a minha pr√≥xima oportunidade. Outra op√ß√£o que tamb√©m resultou para mim foi pensar em empresas para as quais eu gostaria de trabalhar e contactar directamente o Director ou o departamento de Recursos Humanos e perguntar por posi√ß√µes dispon√≠veis (caso estas n√£o estivessem especificadas no website);Evitem a procrastina√ß√£o ‚Äì √© demasiado f√°cil perdermos o foco quando se est√° √† procura de trabalho online. √â normal, estamos conectados, recebemos notifica√ß√µes, como √© poss√≠vel n√£o perder a concentra√ß√£o?! E muito r√°pido pode tornar-se num efeito bola de neve em que se passa mais tempo no Facebook e no Instagram do que propriamente √† procura dum trabalho. Portanto, o que funcionou para mim foi aceder √†s redes sociais ao pequeno almo√ßo, almo√ßo e durante intervalos (mas tentem fazer um balan√ßo em que passam mais tempo √† procura do que a fazer breaks üôÇ );N√£o sejam demasiado cr√≠ticos com voc√™s mesmos ‚Äì depois da li√ß√£o de moral anterior, venho frisar que tamb√©m √© bom parar um bocadinho, ler um livro, passear ou ir ao gin√°sio um par de horas por dia. Vai ajudar-vos a manter a vossa sanidade mental e tornar-vos mais fortes e focados. Precisam de desligar porque ficar dentro de casa focados no port√°til vai levar-vos √† loucura! Eu tinha uma tend√™ncia para panicar quando queria ir ao gin√°sio porque eram menos 2 horas que eu estava a ser produtiva MAS ajudou-me bastante.E √© tudo por agora porque n√£o vos quero entediar com as minhas dicas. Espero que lhes fa√ßam uso e digam-me o que acham!Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)MoreClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...RelatedPosted in: Diary | Tagged: brainstorm, dicas, effective, emprego, how to, job, job haunt, job hunt, job search, network, new job, news, proactive, procurar trabalho, tips, unemployed, unemployment	Post navigationc h a n g eBali Must-See!
