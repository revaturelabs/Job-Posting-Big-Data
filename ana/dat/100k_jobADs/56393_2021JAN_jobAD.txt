Now you have to start the Job Posting process all over again…We understood this problem faced by many of our users and for their benefit; we introduced a feature of Auto Save Draft option. While posting a job, if a user leaves the job posting process in between, the user then has the facility of saving the job as draft for the purpose of doing the rest in the future as per his/her convenience. The draft of the job is saved automatically after 10 minutes of starting the job posting process and the user can go to the draft jobs and post that job again anytime they want. Simple, isn’t it??This entry was posted in Features, What's new? and tagged Auto Save draft, Easy interface, Job Posting, Navigation, User Experience on July 17, 2008 by TimesJobs.
