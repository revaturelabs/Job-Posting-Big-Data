However, it was then that many things were invented or presented, without which we simply could not imagine our life then. Some of them grew into something new, giving him a completely different impulse, while the other part survived to this day in an unchanged form, proving their revolutionism. There were other years when important discoveries were made or revolutionary products were released, but it was in 1995 that the stars and geniuses somehow came together so that they could create something truly outstanding. Something I want to talk about even after a quarter of a century.1995 can indeed be considered something very important in today‚Äôs digital world. An explosive increase in the number of sites alone was worth it. In 1994 there were 2,700, and in 1995 it was already 23,500. Growth continued to grow exponentially, but it was 1995 that did everything so that we now have what we have. In this article, we will talk about people who have contributed to this and perpetuated their names in the world of high technology.Table of ContentsWhere did Jeff Bezos start?The first cartoon studio PixarWindows 95 and the Bill Gates ProphecyFirst Internet Search EngineWhat else did in 1995Where did Jeff Bezos start?If you surfed the Internet in 1995, you might stumble upon a novelty ‚Äì an online bookstore, which began operating in July, declaring itself to be the ‚Äúlargest bookstore on Earth.‚Äù It was run by Seattle-based startup Amazon.com, led by 31-year-old Jeff Bezos, who resigned as vice president of the Wall Street hedge fund. By the end of that year, Amazon had customers all over the country and even in other countries.. iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and other old Apple devices get new iOSAbout 18 months after Amazon opened its business, Bezos showed reporters his warehouse, which was hardly technological. He talked about how he selects novels for reading and showed off a website that was far from what we see now. Then he was worried and was glad that he was able to achieve a good result so quickly. He did not yet know what awaited him next.The strategy was based on discounts on books that are of interest to the reader, and not those that need to be sold quickly. This was the future richest man in the world and told reporters.The first cartoon studio PixarSteve Jobs did not always work for Apple, the company he founded in the early years of the birth of personal computers. Dismissed from Apple, he spent more than ten years in exile (from 1985 to 1997), but did not mess around.He managed Next, first creating very expensive computers, and then focusing on software. He was also the main investor and subsequently the owner of the Pixar animation studio, which in late 1995 released the legendary Toy Story cartoon (Toy Story). It was the first full-length computer animated film. The cartoon was incredibly popular and liked by millions of people.And at about the same time, also in 1995, the studio went public and raised $ 140 million in investments. At this point, Jobs became a billionaire, and at the same time received the post of CEO.On this occasion, in early 1996, he told reporters that he was motivated by the desire to create products with which a person is not familiar, but he has the feeling that he already knows this well. Then Steve was 40 years old, and he died in 2011 at the age of 56 years.. Windows 10 biggest update of 2020Windows 95 and the Bill Gates ProphecyAnother event of 1995 was the release of the famous Windows 95, which stood on the lion‚Äôs share of computers around the world. The novelty was introduced by Microsoft CEO and co-founder Bill Gates.People already wanted to use the new ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù, but an advertising campaign was still launched, which cost $ 300 million. The ad was based on the song Rolling Stones Start Me Up.Interestingly, in the same year, Gates praised the advent of the Internet in our lives and called it the most important development since the release of the IBM PC in 1981. He also said that in the future, Internet pages will bring money, as partners will post their links to them. And now we have advertising banners that bring the money necessary for the existence of the site.For a long time, it was Bill Gates who was the richest man in the world, but later he was replaced from this position by Jeff Bezos. Despite this, Gates is still among the richest people in the world.First Internet Search EngineThe Internet was new to most people in 1995. There were no social networks, sites popular today, and even search engines, but someone had to systematize everything. And then two people appeared ‚Äì Stanford University graduate students named Jerry Young and David Filo, who a year earlier created a catalog called ‚ÄúJerry and David‚Äôs Guide to the World Wide Web.‚Äù Few have heard about this, but almost everyone knows about Yahoo. It was launched in March 1995. In the same year, they also added a search engine function to Yahoo..

Interestingly, the partners began with an office in which there were a dozen computers and a network with a speed of 45 Mbit / s. But every day they added hundreds of sites to their directories.Even then, they understood that the Internet was changing very quickly and this must be consistent. Their search engine has not become the most-most, but is still very popular.What else did in 1995There were other interesting things in 1995. For example, the advent of Java, Craigslist, and even the release of the PlayStation. Although formally the console was released on December 3, 1994, it began to be sold in large quantities at the beginning of 1995.People began to massively use Internet services, increasing their audience from 5 million in 1994 to 12 million in 1995. And also this year eBay appeared.That was such a busy year for the global technology industry. You can recall a lot more, but this is enough to understand that the year has passed not in vain, and those who took part in this have much to be proud of. However, they received a monetary reward more than generous.How useful was this post?Click on a star to rate it!Submit RatingAverage rating / 5. Vote count:No votes so far!
