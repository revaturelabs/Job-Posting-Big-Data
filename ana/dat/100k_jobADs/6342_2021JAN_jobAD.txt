On October 2nd we were out in force telling airlines they need to play an important role in our communities by providing good union jobs at airports at LAX and across the entire country.”Baggage handlers, security officers, cabin cleaners, janitors, wheelchair attendants, and other contracted airport workers provide soaring profits to the global airline industry, which is projected to profit $38.4 billion in 2018, while struggling to make ends meet on low wages and often without benefits or paid days off.Related ArticlesAirport Employees Protest at LAX as Part of International DemonstrationAirport Workers to Launch Worldwide Protests for Higher Pay, Improved Working ConditionsAir travelers should want airline contract employees to be paid well and unionizedWe’re stronger together.Get the latest updates and alerts by email.SIGN UP FOR ALERTSAirports Global Day of Action at SFO, LAX2018-10-042018-10-04http://seiuusww.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/seiu-usww-logo.svgSEIU-USWWhttps://www.seiu-usww.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tim-maddox-lax-action.jpg200px200pxLeave a CommentCancel replySave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.Languages:EnglishFollow UsContact UsHeadquartersNorthern California – Alamedaph (510) 437-8100Southern California – Los Angelesph (213) 284-7705Emailinfo@seiu-usww.orgRegional OfficesSacramentoph (916) 498-9505San Joseph (408) 280-7770Orange Countyph (657) 888-6647San Diegoph (619) 727-5703Designed & Developed by Cierra CreativePrecinct Walk for Gil CisnerosEventsOnline Action to Support Veterans in San DiegoGeneral, Security"
