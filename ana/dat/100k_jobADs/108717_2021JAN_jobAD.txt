Overview: ELDERWOOD AT AMHERST HAS ESTABLISHED A COVID-ONLY CARE CENTER:The pandemic continues to be one of the most difficult challenges we have faced in our lifetime. Few know this better than our healthcare workers who have been there to answer the call to protect the most vulnerable among us since day one of the pandemic.With COVID-19 cases surging in Western New York, Elderwood has responded by establishing a COVID-only care facility to provide an effective way to isolate and care for residents recovering from COVID-19 and mitigate the spread of the virus within other Elderwood senior care communities in Western New York.As a COVID-only care center, the 92-bed Elderwood at Amherst facility will care for residents recovering from COVID-19 transferred from area Elderwood communities and discharged from area hospitals. This maximizes the effectiveness of isolation protocols in senior care facilities, allows them to allocate staff more efficiently, and decompresses demand on acute care beds in the region.WE ARE SEEKING HIGH-QUALITY, COMPASSIONATE LICENSED PRACTICAL NURSES (LPNs)* We are hiring LPNs for all 3 shifts: Days, Evenings & Overnights* Evening full time and part time LPNs are eligible for a Retention Bonus Incentive; Full Time: $4,500, Part Time: $2,225 - paid out quarterly) * Full Time, Part Time, & Per Diem opportunities available* Benefits available for those that qualify; even part-timers qualify if minimum hours are met!* Includes Appreciation Bonus Compensation for your work inside a COVID-only Care CenterLICENSED PRACTICAL NURSE (LPN) POSITION OVERVIEW:* The Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) is assigned to a team of Nursing Assistants and is responsible for skilled treatments, passing of medications and monitoring the personal care services provided by Nursing Assistants; LPNs are also responsible for reporting care and unusual symptoms of residents to supervisor and staff of next shift.* Shift Details: * Days: 6a-2p* Evenings: 2p-10p (Retention Bonus Incentive; Full Time: $4,500, Part Time: $2,225 - paid out quarterly) * Overnights: 10-6a* While establishing a COVID-only Care Center is a temporary measure, your employment with us is not!
