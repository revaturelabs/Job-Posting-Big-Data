Anderson at the Astrophysics Laboratory (LASTRO) of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. Funding for the positions is provided by the ERC Starting Grant \"H1PStars - measuring Hubble's constant to 1% with pulsating stars\". Specifically, the H1PStars team will work towards a 1% measurement of Hubble's constant using distance ladders, pursuing at the same time more precise and accurate distance measurements as well as an improved astrophysical understanding of stellar standard candles.One position is aimed at improved distance measurements using ground- and space-based photometric observations. For details and application instructions, please visit:https://recruiting.epfl.ch/Vacancies/1624/Description/2The other position targets time-domain spectroscopy of pulsating stars and non-variable standard candles. For details and application instructions, please visit:https://recruiting.epfl.ch/Vacancies/1625/Description/2Working environment:The successful applicants will become integral members of a young and dynamic research group funded by an ERC starting grant and an SNSF Eccellenza professorial fellowship. The H1PStars group is based at the Sauverny Observatory site, which offers an inspiring world-class astrophysics research environment shared by LASTRO and the University of Geneva's Department of Astronomy. For information on research at EPFL and in Sauverny, visit https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lastro/ and https://www.unige.ch/sciences/astro/en/ .The successful applicants shall contribute to a collaborative and inclusive team atmosphere, and shall be available for (graduate & undergraduate) student (co-)supervision and mentoring. Funding for each position is available for 3 years. Additional funding for computer equipment, science travel, publication charges, etc. is available.Swiss scientists have access to ESO (e.g. VLT, ALMA, E-ELT) and ESA (e.g. HST, XMM-Newton, JWST, Euclid) facilities. EPFL further enjoys preferred access to the 1.2m Swiss Euler telescope at La Silla observatory, Chile. EPFL is a full member of SDSS-V, DESI, and 4MOST, part of the MOONS and of the future BlueMUSE consortia, and member of the SKA Organisation. EPFL is recognized as one of the best Universities in Europe and covers both engineering and fundamental sciences.EPFL is located in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. However, it is fully feasible to get by in English thanks to a large international community that includes CERN and the United Nations, in addition to many corporate headquarters. Applicants desiring to learn French will be encouraged to do so.Requirements and Application material:A PhD in (astro)physics is required by the time the appointment starts.
