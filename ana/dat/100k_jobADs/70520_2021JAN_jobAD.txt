However, the best you can do is prepare yourself well and make sure that you’re not jeopardizing your preparations by wasting too much time in making too many predictions. Do whatever you can do to the best of your ability. Here are some tips that might help you:Your first responsibility would be to visit the website of the university and learn about it as much as you can- be it about its history, its present, what it generally looks for in its students besides their academic qualifications etc. Treat the interview as an opportunity to open up before the interviewer or the medical faculty or the staff. Be yourself and convey your ideals, motives and passion for medicine. There is no point in being intimidated.If possible try and get an idea about the interview process a little. Look up the website and see if it has a separate section dedicated to this or not. At times, students who have already faced these interviews in the previous years post their experiences online. You can go through them in a bid to gather some insights. Generally these interviews are informal affairs whereby candidates get to interact with the faculty members one-on-one. The interviewers would be seriously considering your application. They would keep the application with themselves at the interview and treat as a springboard.Motives for pursuing a career in medicineYour academic record- be prepared to answer questions related to weaker grades (if any) or any other inconsistencies in the academic careerExtracurricular activities- make sure that you are speaking about your interests hereTechnical questions related to medicineCurrent concerns in the healthcare industry- you might as well be asked about the ethics followed in this professions, any current and relevant controversy etcOther TipsBe on timeDress appropriatelyAdopt a very polite demeanorMake sure that each and every question that you’re answering is marked by sincerity- do not express complacency in any wayAsk relevant questions to prove that you’re sincere about learning more about the place you’re interviewing atPossible Interview QuestionWhy do you want to be a doctor?Why are you interested in following such a rigorous discipline?Please tell us about your interests a littleWhy do you want to join the University Of Florida College Of Medicine?Please tell us about your power of analysis.Post New Comment:Name:Email:Comment:This website is up for sale at $3,000.00.
