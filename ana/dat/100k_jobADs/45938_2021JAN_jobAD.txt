This is during the 24-hour meeting when deputants are every three minutes. It is so farfetched it is not even funny.”After seeing the picture, Ford dismissed it.“Oh buddy, that’s not how I sleep,” he said, according to reports.The photo, posted to a “social-democratic” blog two years ago, was apparently taken during a 22-hour meeting of the mayor’s executive committee from July 28 to 29, 2011. A Twitter posting of the picture is dated July 29.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedThe meeting featured 168 citizens speaking to the executive committee about contentious cutbacks to city services, including, memorably, a teenage girl breaking down in tears while discussing her love of the city’s libraries and a man using a sock puppet to tell councillors not to act like puppets.The newly circulated picture shows Ford at the head of the executive table. With 168 people speaking in about 22 hours, Ford would have been introducing speakers at a clip of one approximately every five minutes. Speakers were given about three minutes to talk, and councillors then had a few minutes to ask questions.Ford left the meeting just a few times, but then-deputy mayor Doug Holyday said: “I can tell you other mayors never stayed this long.”The Star reported that Ford left twice for about an hour each time.The mayor also found himself under criticism for a comment at the 16-hour mark of the meeting, after the author of a children’s book called Words that Start with B spoke, prompting an off-camera remark from Ford.“I can think of another word for her,” Ford can beheard saying in video.Giorgio Mammoliti‘COMPLETE EMBARRASSMENT’The latest image of Ford — who at the best of times always seems to be caught in an unflattering pose — was an easy target for the mayor’s critics given his comments Wednesday.Ford said the photo of a city employee allegedly sleeping at his desk at a North York rec centre, provided by staff member of Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti, was a “complete embarrassment” and he was taking it seriously.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continued“If this is the case, I’m going to ask for the manager and the employee to be dismissed. We cannot tolerate this,” he said. “I want people to show up to work and do their job. If they can’t do their job, there’s thousands of other people that are willing and able to do their job.”Ford also suggested his office, always on the lookout for a way to downsize government, was looking into contracting out parks and recreation jobs.CUPE Local 79 president Tim Maguire denounced the city employee picture’s release and said: “Our assumption, until further information, is that this employee was on a mid-morning break.”He also called it a “media stunt.”Toronto’s Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Sarah Polley was among those circulating the Ford photo Thursday.https://twitter.com/SarahEPolley/status/390822627587026945With files from Natalie Alcoba, National PostShare this article in your social networkShare this Story: As Rob Ford calls for firing of ‘sleeping’ worker, web unearths photo of mayor allegedly asleep at City HallCopy LinkEmailFacebookTwitterRedditPinterestLinkedInTumblrShopping essentialsPosted NewsletterSign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.Email AddressThere was an error, please provide a valid email address.By clicking on the sign up button you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.
