The Web and mobile based apps are very user friendly and helps to capture all essential information. The welcome session by the lead appraiser was very informative and helpful to prepare for the appraisal. The Web system also has plenty in built support to assist with completion of necessary documentation. Overall very satisfied with the process as well as the web/mobile interface.”Anonymous – Consultant Psychiatry (September 2019)	“I found the Medsu system easy to understand and use. I had to upload a lot of supporting material, but no more than for NHS appraisals I have had, and it was easier the second time. The process is robust and comprehensive. The appraisals were via Skype. My appraiser was excellent, flexible and gave helpful advice. My second appraisal was in my revalidation year and I was revalidated without any problems.”Dr Sam Wilson – Consultant General Adult Psychiatry (September 2019)	“I am a consultant radiologist; I would like to share my experience with MP Locums and Medsu. I am happy and very satisfied from my link with both company in the revalidation procedure, it was very easy, and I didn’t get any difficulty in my appraisal, they are always here to answer my questions and support me in my appraisal. I highly recommend it.”Dr H Negila – Consultant Radiology (September 2019)	“Healthier Business have worked alongside MP Locums since 2012. In that time, we have carried out their Occupational Health Screening, provided Online Training and latterly Video Link BLS Training. The staff from MP Locums throughout this time have been a pleasure to work with. Their extensive knowledge of the compliance process for NHS agency workers and what documentation is required, from our perspective, in order for their candidates to be deemed compliant makes our job as an Occupational Health Screening company much easier. We look forward to another productive 7 years working together.”David Rankin – Client Support Manager, Healthier Business (September 2019)	“MP Locums have been providing us with cover for the over 3 years and have a good working relationship with all the girls in recruitment I have dealt with in that time.They are aware of our requirements and strive to help where possible and do bring new Drs to us when available. We are continuingly looking for extra GP cover for our Service and would be more than happy for MP to provide that. Claire and Rachael have in the past asked for feedback to help strive towards a better working relationship, so all our needs are met.”Anne Robertson – OOH’s Administrator, NHS Lanarkshire (October 2018)	“I discovered MP Locums through a golf charity event earlier this year, where I gave them my details to initiate registration. MP Locums made the registration process simple from start to finish. The compliance officer met with me in Dundee, which was convenient, and took the time to go through all the paperwork.”Dr Ghazala – ST1 Orthopaedics (August 2019)	© 2019 MP Locums.
