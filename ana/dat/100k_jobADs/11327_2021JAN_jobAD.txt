The text therefore continues, “Then Job arose, and rent his robe,” which is usually an indication of sadness among men. Note however that the text says, “Then”, namely after he heard about the death of his children, so that he might seem more sad over their loss than the loss of his possessions. For it is characteristic of a hard and insensible heart to not grieve over dead friends, but it is characteristic of virtuous men to not have this grief in an immoderate way as St.He excludes this dignity saying, “Let that day be darkness,” an idea which seems frivolous and vain according to a superficial reading of the text. For the day of his birth had passed and was not now present. What has passed cannot be changed. How then could a day which has passed be changed into night? One should know that some judgments one makes about things are expressed as desires. So now the text says, “Let that day be darkness,” as if it were to be said: The day of my birth ought to be in darkness because it befits the darkness and misery which I am suffering.To the earth. ” (40:1) This can also be interpreted in another way. The expression, “from my mother’s womb” can be literally taken as the womb of the mother who bore him. When he says next “naked I shall return there,” the term “there” establishes a simple relation. For a man cannot return a second time to the womb of his own mother, but he can return to the state which he had in the womb of his mother in a certain respect, namely in that he is removed from the company of men. In saying this he reasonably shows that a man should not be absorbed with sadness because of the loss of exterior goods, since exterior goods are not connatural to him, but come to him accidentally.Download PDF sampleGlavnaia Library > Nonfiction 5 > Download Commentary on the Book of Job (Expositio Super Iob ad by Thomas Aquinas (translated by Brian Mulladay; edited by PDFRated 4.87 of 5 – based on 30 votesCategoriesAddiction RecoveryAestheticsAmerican HistoryComics Graphic NovelsEndocrinology MetabolismEpidemiologyFantasyFrenchGame TheoryGeography CulturesGerman 8GovernmentHorrorInternal MedicineInternationalInternational 1Library ManagementLiterary ClassicsLiterary TheoryManagerialMartial ArtsMemoirsNonfiction 1Nonfiction 12Nonfiction 5Nuclear PhysicsOceanographyPhilosophyProbabilityProfessionalProgramming Programming LanguagesPulmonary Thoracic MedicineSuspenseTibetanMost Popular BooksRecent PostsDownload The Bone Yard (Body Farm, Book 6) by Jefferson Bass PDFDownload While My Pretty One Sleeps by Mary Higgins Clark PDFDownload The Analyst by John Katzenbach PDFDownload Daddy's Gone A Hunting by Mary Higgins Clark PDFDownload All Around the Town by Mary Higgins Clark PDFDownload Proof Positive (Amanda Jaffe, Book 3) by Phillip Margolin PDFDownload In Their Footsteps & Thief of Hearts by Tess Gerritsen PDFDownload Odd Interlude #1 by Dean Koontz PDFDownload Into the Darkest Corner LP: A Novel by Elizabeth Haynes PDFDownload The Pardon (Jack Swyteck, Book 1) by James Grippando PDFArchivesMarch 2017Powered by WordPress and Smartline."
