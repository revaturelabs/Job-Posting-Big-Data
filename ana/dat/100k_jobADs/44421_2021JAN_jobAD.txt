When I was there last year i asked our waitress how long she had been there, she said over 7 years.

She said it was the most boring job and she was jealous of her brother who was a sweeper in custodial, because he got to walk around and talk to the guests all day. Apparently sitting on top of that boat wearing knee socks will give you quite an interesting tan, too. She can still snap into \"tour voice\" and do the whole spiel, along with narrate just about anything. Very funny!A signature should go here.CommentPostCancelecdlanddudeIrrational Mr. Toad FanJoin Date: Feb 2005Posts: 687ShareTweet#1709-26-2006, 12:18 AMRe: What do you think are some of the best and worst jobs at DLR?It's funny because here at the MK, the horse cleaning shifts are the most popular. Mainly because you get to watch the parade and the cleanup is simple.CommentPostCancelTom ChaneyGodwin Glacier, AlaskaMiceChat Round-Up CrewJoin Date: Feb 2005Posts: 7772ShareTweet#1809-26-2006, 12:41 AMRe: What do you think are some of the best and worst jobs at DLR?Worst:City Hall CM: for reasons stated aboveSpace Mountain CM: spending your days in a VERY noisy, fast-paced dungeonIndy CM: sameHISTA or Golden Dreams CM: so lonely!Paradise Pier Midway Games CM: so lonely and embarassing!Chef: Day after day preparing lousy, overpriced food.The person who stitches names on mouse ears: \"Hey, that looks awful!Best:Main St. Vehicle Driver: Relaxing and fun!Driving Uncle Walt's Firetruck: The dream Disneyland job!Blue Bayou/Club 33 waiter/waitress: dealing with upscale guests.
