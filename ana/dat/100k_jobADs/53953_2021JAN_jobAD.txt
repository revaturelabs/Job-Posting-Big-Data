In these instances, significant expertise in the profession may be just as valuable as a PhD.It's becoming more common for lecturers to have or to be working towards a teaching qualification. These come under a variety of names, including the Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education (PGCHE) and Postgraduate Certificate in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education.Some universities ask for an HEA Fellowship instead, awarded by Advance HE. This can be obtained by completing a teaching qualification that is aligned to the HEA UK Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF) for teaching and supporting learning in higher education.In the early stages of your career, it may be difficult to gain a permanent contract as an HE lecturer and you may have to accept posts on a part-time or fixed-term contract.
