Sciences Po.Background: We are seeking to appoint a Researcher to work with Prof Laura Morales in the project “Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud (SSHOC)”, grant number 823782, of the H2020 programme INFRAEOSC-2018-2 funded by the European Commission.SSHOC is a large-scale collaborative project and, within its larger scope, the team led by Prof Morales at CEE will take care of a sub-project in coordination with COST Action 16111 ETHMIGSURVEYDATA in order to consolidate a comprehensive (and constantly updated) database that lists all the hundreds of quantitative surveys undertaken with ethnic and migrant minority (sub)samples across Europe in a way that it complies with the FAIR principles. Additionally, the team at CEE will lead the development of a pilot sub-project that will allow assessing the feasibility of setting a full stream of the European Question Bank (EQB) dedicated to the ethnic and migrant minority (EMM) survey data that will be compiled by the COST Action ETHMIGSURVEYDATA, in coordination with other partners in the larger SSHOC project. The appointed research will thus join a large international team of experts from all across Europe on the integration of EMMs and on survey research and will have the chance to work on a research project that will break new ground in these fields. This is, thus, a unique opportunity to build a career in survey research focusing on this specific sub-population.Contract details: The appointment is full-time and available from 18th February (or as soon as possible thereafter, and always before 11th March) with a contract duration of 24 months (renewable subject to funding).Type of contract: Fixed-duration contract (CDD)Gross salary (salaire brut): between €2,500 and € 3,000 per month depending on qualifications and experience.Other contributions: partial contribution for transportation card within Paris, and restaurant tickets.How to apply:The full details of the call for applications, including the description of the project, the tasks to undertake and the criteria that candidates should meet can be found here: https://www.sciencespo.fr/centre-etudes-europeennes/fr/content/call-applications-1Please send (1) a cover letter outlining precisely the qualifications and skills that match the requirements for the position, as well as the expected salary, (2) a CV and (3) an example describing previous work managing large-scale survey data or similar tasks to those involved in this project to linda.amrani@sciencespo.frby 5 pm on Friday 25th January 2019.Interviews will be planned for the week of 4th February.Facebook0Twitter0Google+0LinkedIn0← Job vacancy: Project Assistant for the MAGYC ProjectJob vacancy: 4Mi global manager, Mixed Migration Centre →Upcoming EventsSave the date: MACIMIDE Annual Conference 23-24 September 2021all eventsNewsletterIf you wish to receive information about MACIMIDE and related events, call for papers, research news, vacancies and more, please subscribe to our Newsletter.EmailBy subscribing to this newsletter, I accept the privacy rules of this site.MACIMIDE Calendar<< Jan 2021 >>M T W T F S S28	 29	 30	 31	 1	 2	 3	4	 5	 6	 7	 8	 9	 10	11	 12	 13 14	 15	 16	 17	18	 19	 20	 21	 22	 23	 24	25	 26	 27	 28	 29	 30	 31	Follow usCopyright © 2021 Maastricht Centre for Citizenship, Migration and Development (MACIMIDE)Powered by WordPress and Origin"
