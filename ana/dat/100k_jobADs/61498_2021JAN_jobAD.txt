Its primary business is providing business forms, management software and professional services to car dealerships. Its software is used to manage sales logistics at dealerships. It also produces forms used in medicine and insurance. Reynolds and Reynolds was founded in 1866 as a printer of standardized business forms. It began developing and marketing digital products in the 1960s. This was followed by a major downsizing of the printing division and subsequent advancements in its software products. By the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds had won contracts with all of the Big Three automotive manufacturers, as well as some insurance businesses. The company went public in 1961, but was re-formed as a private company in 2006, when it was merged with Universal Computer Systems, resulting in a culture clash between the two companies.Total Jobs:24Total Experts:10Average Pay:$105,326Total value of jobs:$4,845,000% Masters:24%Learn More About Reynolds & Reynolds* Ladders EstimatesMore Jobs at Reynolds & ReynoldsSoftware Developer$80K — $100KReynolds & Reynolds•Dayton, OH 454025 days agoJava Developer$80K — $100KReynolds & Reynolds•Detroit, MI 482015 days agoJava Developer$80K — $100KReynolds & Reynolds•Ann Arbor, MI 481035 days agoIT Systems Engineer$80K — $100KReynolds & Reynolds•Dayton, OH 4540221 days agoInformation Security Director$150K — $200KReynolds & Reynolds•Dayton, OH 4540221 days agoSimilar JobsProduct Manager - Operations and Implementations$80K — $100KWebMD•New York, NY 100019 days agoImplementation Manager$80K — $100KFidelity National Information Services, Inc•Lowell, MA 01850YesterdayImplementation Manager$80K — $100KFidelity National Information Services, Inc•Lowell, MA 01850YesterdayTechnical Product Manager - Implementation Tools$80K — $100KWorkday•Pleasanton, CA 945666 days agoImplementation Manager$80K — $100K120WaterAudit•Indianapolis, IN 462014 days agoMore Enterprise Technology JobsVice President - Geospatial SalesConfidential Company•RemoteTodaySenior Data Engineer – Hadoop, Spark, Big DataConfidential Company•Remote2 days agoEnterprise Portfolio Management - Agile, Rally / JiraConfidential Company•Austin, TX 787305 days agoSenior Software Engineering Manager - SaaS, Stakeholder ManagementConfidential Company•Austin, TX 787305 days agoSoftware Engineer - Back-End Development, PHP, LaravelConfidential Company•Austin, TX 787305 days agoFind similar product implementation manager jobs:NationwideAnn Arbor, MINews & Career AdviceJob SearchThe top 10 companies offering the most consistent remote work opportunities over the yearsSarah DillonThis is what recruiters do and do not want to see on your social mediaKyle SchnitzerThese are the industries that hire the most Harvard Business School gradsMeredith SchneiderLegal Privacy Press & Media Work at LaddersHighest-Paying Jobs Highest-Paying Companies Highest-Paying Careers Highest-Paying Industries Cities & States Expert Network News & Career Advice DirectoryFAQs Member Help Recruiter Help Contact Us Unsubscribe© Ladders, Inc.Legal | Privacy | Press & Media | Work at LaddersHighest-Paying Jobs | Highest-Paying Companies | Highest-Paying Careers | Highest-Paying Industries | Cities & States | Expert Network | News & Career Advice DirectoryFAQs | Member Help | Recruiter Help | Contact Us | Unsubscribe© Ladders, Inc."
