If everything goes as “planned” then it could possibly be the last time you’ll ever find yourself looking for another job, period. Imagine never having to update your resume or fill out another application ever again. No more back ground checks or pee pee tests, no more making someone else’s dreams come true. The time is now and the time is yours. Your life, along with many others lives are about to change for the better, drastically in every which way possible.“Governments don’t want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking. That is against their interests. They want obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept it.” George CarlinAs a society we’ve been conditioned to think (or to not think) a certain way. They (the powers that be) want us dumbed down and want us not thinking for ourselves or living self-sufficiently. They depend on us to do all their menial tasks; they feed off our energy and suck us all dry, they are parasitic vampires that need to exist no more. If you ever have those stinkin’ thinkin’ thoughts of failure and self-doubt when it comes to working independently then maybe they’ve been planted in your brain and been a part of their whole sadistic plan all along. It’s time to put a stop to those paralyzing thoughts and start believing in yourself and know that you ARE capable and worthy of success. If you have always had an hourly wage job and never been the “one to lead the pack”, then maybe this post will help with that. Our whole goal here is to help others think, deprogram, get educated on the truth, become financially free and to change the way society “normally” operates, because it’s obviously not working for everyone or everything. This quote really stood out to me and it is something I need to constantly remember.“There is only one way to avoid criticism: do nothing, say nothing and be nothing.” – AristotleI personally fall into this trap a lot and it’s something that I’ve been working on. I like to be liked, what can I say? As a lot of you do too, I’m sure. I like to make others happy and get anxious when I can’t. So when I can’t fulfill whatever the other person wants from me I shut down and do nothing. Because just like the quote, if I do nothing and say nothing I avoid their criticism and avoid furthering they’re disappointment with me.You (and me included) can’t be so scared of what others think all of the time or else nothing of importance is ever going to get done. You got to be your own worst critic and if you believe in something so much and have the faith to back it then there’s no stopping you. What you WILL to happen, WILL happen. Action is the key with every plan and action that is fueled 100% by truth and goodness, well that’s just a match made in heaven. And that is exactly what we’re doing here, with The Unidigi Network. OneBigJob is a part of that network and it is a whole new grassroots, publicly owned business capable of creating millions if not BILLIONS of jobs, that just about anyone can do.These are my “mind over matter” thoughts so when I find myself getting psyched out or having the overwhelming feeling of defeat, I try to remember these facts. Maybe some of them will hit home for you and maybe some won’t, just thought I’d put it out there regardless.On a piece of paper, punch in your own numbers and see what you get! I bet you’ll be surprised by the outcome!Just look at the people who do sales for a living, take Kirby for example. Here’s a fine product that has been around for over a hundred years and IS the Cadillac of vacuums. The vacuum’s only down fall is, is the fact that they’re so gosh darn expensive. Buying one brand new will set you back well over $2500! That’s more than enough to buy you a nice used car! Yet there are people out there that sell them door to door, every day, continually and make a decent living at it (I know because I was one of them). It’s all about; believing in what you’re doing, knowing your product, working hard, not giving up and having a positive-c an-do-attitude.A thing to remember when you become a salesman or woman is it’s all about numbers! The more people you contact or talk to the more chances at selling the product you have, makes sense. Work to the law of averages. The more nos you get the more yeses you get. Then after a while you will begin to get paid for every door you knock, even the ones that say NO or aren’t home. Know you numbers and improve them consistently.The Unidigi Network and its project partners are so completely different from all other “sales” jobs out there it’s not even funny. You won’t find anyone at the top focused on getting rich. This is one job you can be proud of having and it has no post sales, sleazy feelings. This is the most patriotic task you will likely ever come across in your whole life. If you feel like something isn’t quite right with the world and have some ideas of your own and would like to work for yourself making cash daily all the while helping others and working towards some really awesome world altering goals then this could be for you. If you’re anything like me, mid to late 20’s still have no “career”, haven’t gone to college, jumping from job to J.O.B. (just over broke) and still have no clue what to do with their life than maybe, JUST MAYBE, this is YOUR calling. I know for a fact that this IS what I’m meant to do with the rest of my life, and maybe it’s what you’re supposed to do too.The 99%, the middle class, the lower class, whatever you want to call us, it’s We The People that WILL change things and we’re in this together whether we like it or not. We might not always agree with everything 100% but one thing is for sure; the fact that there are some deep-rooted issues in our society and if not fixed soon they will only continue to get worse. Let’s work together and start fixing some of these problems. Let’s use these awesome resources like OneBigJob with signing people up at Unidigi and making money from the Goyim Gazette books to further our goal of bringing pure democracy, true freedom and ultimate justice back into our society. Everything that we’re doing is going to be so huge no matter what and there’s no telling which way it’s going to go. Right now we just need some awesome individuals to help move it in the right direction.Do you want to make a difference, be a part of a project that WILL ultimately change the world, society and make history? Then join in on the task at hand NOW!Welcome to the start of a very much-needed and well deserved revolution!What If?This is a popular excerpt from Davids second book, the Everything ELSE Pages;…. tree huggers, gun nuts, hippies, liberals and conservatives from every gentile religion and race found out they were all on the same team? What if paying interest to corrupt and evil banking families was a ridiculous notion of the past? What if one day materialistic compensation was the last thing on your mind and all you really wanted to be proud of and known for was your contribution/s to society? What if everyone of able body or mind had a choice between working or not and were remunerated by society accordingly? What if we were rewarded for being frugal? What if every banker war going on around the world were to cease, forever? What if when people get sick or die there’s zero doubt it was of natural causes instead of being from the 1,000s of unnecessary poisons in our air water and food? What if the oldest cure for cancer on earth which also happens to be free, harmless and highly effective for treating 100s of other diseases was legalized instead of held back in the name of a corrupt, multi-trillion dollar, for profit medical system? What if your voice mattered in consideration, creation and curtailing of all the laws used to govern you? What if there was very little use for militaries or police to protect us? What if it turned out there was no almost zero actual terrorism and the majority of the terrorist attacks in our history were all orchestrated by bankers seeking world domination? What if the media was full of good news? What if there were no satanic symbolisms and subliminal messages in all of our music, movies, games, products and advertisements? What if evil wasn’t popularized as being silly, cute or fun? What if conducting horrific, agonizing experiments on millions of animals is evil? What if murdering 260 million absolutely innocent, unarmed, non-combative men, women and children over the last 100 years to establish central banks in every country on earth were evil? What if those innocent men, women and children were just like you and could easily have been your neighbors and friends? What if the only advertisements around were for free products that were good for you and the world? What if newscasters were honest and what they report on left you feeling inspired instead of downtrodden? What if we mostly policed ourselves and created reward systems for positive characteristics like honesty, being decent and having compassion? What if you could easily, freely and instantly vote to have a say on all the matters important to you? What if no law could be changed without the peoples’ input? What if we could manufacture and use the many highly efficient motors that have been invented but covered up by the bankers who own a $200 Trillion Dollar Energy Sector mostly on dirty fossil fuels? What if you could buy a generator for your house that creates energy without pollution and runs for decades without maintenance? What if doubting such a thing showed complete ignorance of the fact that we already have the technology which is self evidenced in that we’re so advanced that we are now splicing DNA to create new plants, animals and human hybrids and that we can transfer the human memory to a computer, control all the weather on earth and create earthquakes with HAARP? In fact, what if scientists somewhere are now working on viable, realistic inventions that will soon do pretty much anything else you can imagine? What if you had a say in what we do with technology and where we go from here? What if hate, violence and abuse were to diminish to nearly un-recordable levels? What if there were no more secrets of any kind being kept from you by your government? What if you could do whatever the hell you wanted during your life so long as it doesn’t harm anyone else? What if there was just one governing entity for the entire planet and every person alive had equal say in its’ power and what we do as a race? What if there were no borders anywhere on earth because it’s all ours? What if we actually had a “pure democracy” where you chose the candidates, not just between the ones offered to you by fascists? What if your possessions could never be taken from you? What if a missing child was an extremely rare and explainable event instead of over 200,000 kids going missing without a trace every year in the US, a society where at least 6 million of it’s members have a 3000 year history of sacrificing innocent children to their g-d? What if medicines and vaccines didn’t make you sicker or kill you? What if we only needed minimal amounts of coal, oil or natural gas and zero nuclear power? What if nukes were a thing of the past? What if our government and corporate representatives were accountable for their actions? What if your ID was of your choosing and forever unique across the globe? What if you never got another account number or other identifier assigned to you from any entity, especially not a government, or anyone else ever again? What if no one was getting ready to put a chip in your forehead to make you a more malleable and obedient slave? What if the leaders of your government didn’t think of and use you like a lab rat? What if the only people who were under any kind of video surveillance and strict transparency were our leaders exactly as they should be? What if our leaders couldn’t keep any secrets at all, and EVERYTHING they did was absolutely transparent? What if they didn’t call you “useless eaters”, “cattle”, “shegetz”, “shkotzim” or “goyim” and considered you as an equal to them? What if the leaders of your government weren’t planning on enslaving or killing you, your friends, family, associates and neighbors for their New World Order in the name of their g-d? What if you could do absolutely everything you needed to do for your entire life with just one user name and one password that was totally secure, unique and under your sole control? What if you had total oversight and control in the use of your personal information in all regards? What if there was a much better option than the CIAs’ Facebook? What if free speech was real again? What if privacy actually mattered? What if there was no such thing as identity theft? What if no one were more important than the rest of us unless we decided they were? What if murder rates dropped through the floor? What if our air, water, soil and food wasn’t tainted with poisons? What if we could take trips to other planets just for fun? What if there were no diseases? What if mankind respected earth and all of its’ resources? What if animals were treated with simple humaneness and even reverence for the grandeur of their diversity, contributions and spirit? What if fresh, healthy, satisfying foods were popularized, suggested, abundant and available for all? What if obesity, diabetes, asthma and all the other diseases we’ve seen jump 500% to 5,000% over the last 30 years were all to disappear because of the change in our foods? What if we could live longer, way longer? What if the environment were healthy again? What if global warming ended and everything went back to normal? What if all the fish in the seas and animals around the world were going to thrive instead of go extinct? What if anyone with talent could become a successful musician, artist, writer or actor? What if the only advertisements you came across were those sought and of your choosing? What if there were no such things as telemarketing, spam or junk mail? What if stresses over retirement mostly consisted of passing on your wisdom, traditions and experiences to youths? What if government were made up of men and women of honor and conscious again? What if every corporation on earth were owned and controlled collectively by all people democratically? What if banks ceased to exist? What if there was no such thing as taxation of any kind? What if everyone who participated in society were rewarded equally and got bonuses for providing exceptional works beneficial to everyone or for making extra contributions to the whole of us? What if you could trust everything you hear in the news and media? What if your rights actually meant something? What if basic schooling consisted of things you really needed to know? What if the whole of human knowledge were available to everyone and you could learn about anything you wanted, for free? What if there was no venue or supportive system for greed? What if everything our governments did made sense again? What if there were no such thing as government trolls, shills online? What if you belonged to a network of people that valued democracy, privacy, freedom and individuality above and beyond profits and control? What if you had plenty of freedom and free time to truly enjoy your life and the precious time on earth you’ve been given? What if everyone had an equal stake in our future and were encouraged to do things that made it brighter? What if we alone could decide what our governments do and how many natural resources were used? What if our leaders were nothing more than signatory representatives of our wants, needs and desires? What if conspirators seeking riches or power were to find out bribing or killing our leaders couldn’t make any difference because they only do our will? What if they could be kicked out of office instantly at any time per our desires? What if we could look to our future and that of earth with hope and anticipation instead of confusion and dread? What if we knew, completely and absolutely the truth about EVERYTHING knowable? What if everyone you were to meet had shoes on their feet and somethin’ to eat, wouldn’t that be neat? And what if everyone had shelter? What if you could be extremely proud of being part to the human race? What if it were all up to you right now? What if attaining real peace, liberty, freedom and happiness requires a small effort on our parts? What if freedom still wasn’t free? What if like all things, we had to effort to succeed? And what if in this case the effort was so infinitesimally small and trivial, and the payoff so gargantuanly huge and meaningful, both could be considered immeasurable? And what would you think of those who didn’t do so much as pass this along and support our efforts to right the world?Help break the spell everyone’s under RIGHT NOW!!! It’s time we all get together to finally win the American Revolution and bring forth the pure democracy that was originally intended, this time for all the people of the world! This is THE wave of change for humanity and it’s bigger than anything we’ve ever done. Getting rid of millions of evil LIARS, cheats and murderous, pedophilic scum will be our legacy, this is our chance to shine.You are going to take part in it and if we’re successful, which we will be, a very bright future will be ours. After just a few short years out from under the hands of evil, people everywhere will be becoming financially and environmentally sound, happier and more productive than ever. Love, peace and prosperity will reign. Again, that was from The Everything Else Pages. David has made sure that both of his books remain free and available to the general public. However, if you’re new to “conspiracy realities” or are easily frightened, the Goyim Gazette is likely a better way to learn about the world you’re living in. It’s free to everyone as well.Who We AreAbout The JobGetting StartedOneBigJob StoreUnidigi SignupFAQTermsAboutContact© 2014 - 2021 OneBigJob.com All Rights ReservedYour name:Your email address:Send post to email address, comma separated for multiple emails.Cancel"
