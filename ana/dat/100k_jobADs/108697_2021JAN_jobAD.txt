October 12, 2020 admin	0 Comments	Online learning is part of the new normal as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage on in the country. With educational institutions transitioning to distance learning as part of the Department of Education and the Commission on Higher Education’s mandate, STI Education Services Group Inc. partnered with Globe for their Load Up service, which will prove vital in students’ access to learning management systems, websites, and various apps needed for online education.Through the partnership, the institution secured Globe’s Load Up service, which gives unlimited prepaid credits to multiple recipients. The Load Up service can only be accessed via a secure web-based platform where recipients of the prepaid load credits or promos from Globe are managed in real-time.“As internet connectivity becomes of greater importance for education, we have sought plans and solutions to make learning more accessible for students coming from different walks of life. Our partnership with Globe is one way of fulfilling our commitment to the learning continuity of our students and to empower them to continuously access their learning modules, tools, and apps while at home despite the pandemic,” shares Aisa Q. Hipolito, Vice President for Academics at STI Education Services Group, Inc.Moreover, in response to the increasingly digitized time, the institution has launched its own eLearning Management System (eLMS), which is an online platform that contains resources from handouts, modules, and assignments needed by students to enable learning. The eLMS is accessible via tablet, smartphone, desktop computer, or laptop. Students can review, study ahead, and get in touch with schoolmates as well as their professors anytime and anywhere–all in the comfort of their home.Established on August 21, 1983, STI is one of the largest networks of schools in the country.
