The illusion of stability is shattered. You woke up with an income. You’re going to sleep tonight without one.All of a sudden you wish that you could manage expenses effectively. What’s going to happen in a month or two if you can’t find work? Is this going to be a blip along what will hopefully be a long and illustrious career path? Or is this the start of a majorly negative new chapter in your life?First of all, if you believe that you have been relieved of your duties under less than fair circumstances, you may have a case – speak to wrongful termination lawyers. Now let’s look at a quick checklist of how to move on from losing your job.Gain some semblance of directionOK. You’ve been let go. Made redundant. Laid off. Whatever the label, the outcome is the same. You’re no longer financially viable. The first thing to do is to work out an exact monthly figure regarding your bills, and divide up what money you have to see how many months you can cover.Don’t worry, for most people, this won’t be an answer in years or even half a year, but more like one, two, or three months. This will steady you mentally. Anxiety is created by a fear of the unknown. Writing down your financial situation is going to be tough, but it’ll put your back to the wall. Now. You need to get out there. And fast.Finding opportunities and selling yourself in an interviewThere are multiple job sites available. Join as many as you can. Join them all. Be sure to check the box that indicates you would like employers to have access to your profile (some people in current employment prefer to be hidden from searches). Don’t forget that social media is another great way to find jobs – especially LinkedIn.Finally, when you do get an interview, you need to know how to sell your situation. Don’t talk about being let go or being made redundant. This can come off as a euphemism for career termination due to being an ineffective worker.Instead, talk about how your previous company has restructured towards alternate skill sets not in keeping with your refined expertise, and mention any recent learning you have done that shows how you are at the cutting edge of your field.In conclusion, try to retain a positive frame of mind. And as mentioned in the beginning of this article; if you have grounds for your employment having been wrongfully terminated, take legal action.TagsArticles April 2020 finance Legal Advice UnemploymentTourism TattlerApril 21, 20201,633 2 minutes readFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Reddit VKontakte Share via Email PrintTourism TattlerFacebookTwitterPinterestInstagramRelated ArticlesLaw of Contracts – Part 27March 13, 20175 Steps to Filing a Wrongful Death ClaimJuly 25, 2019Adventure Tourism from a Legal Perspective – Part 5November 9, 2016Law of Contracts – Part 24December 11, 2016Check AlsoCloseLegalLaw of Contracts – Part 21September 12, 2016FIND CONTENT BY CATEGORYFIND CONTENT BY CATEGORY Select Category Accolades Accommodation Adventure Tourism Africa Outbound Announcements Archives Art Articles Attractions Aviation Blog Business & Finance Category Competition Conservation COVID-19 Culture Destinations DISCUSSIONS Editorial Comment Education Environment Events food GeoDirectory Project Guiding Health Hospitality Human Resources Investment Legal Letters Lifestyle Marketing News Niche Tourism Opinion Opportunities Photo Gallery Photography Politics Post Social Procurement Responsible Tourism Reviews Risk & Insurance Safety SECURITY Sport Tourism Sustainable Tourism Sustainable Tourism News Technology Tourism TOURISM MONTH Tours Trade News Training & Education Transport Travel Uncategorized VisasSubscribe to our NewsletterSubscribe to our mailing listRecentPopularCommentsBest Golf Courses in Africa4 days agoBest Places To Scuba Dive In Africa4 days agoRiders For Health – Providing Motorbikes for Health Workers in AfricaNovember 1, 2020Akon Secures $6 Billion Contract To Build His Crypto City In AfricaOctober 31, 2020Cape Town chef to take charge of the kitchen in the 2016 Tour de FranceJuly 5, 2020How to Become a Tourist Guide in South AfricaMay 13, 2019So you want to be a tour operator?May 5, 2013Great White Shark BehaviourDecember 6, 2019New South African Visa Regulations PostponedSeptember 16, 2014Off-Road 4×4 Driving GuideApril 8, 2019Rose MartineFine way of describing, and pleasant piece of writing to get...THE REPORT IS NOT CORRECT.
