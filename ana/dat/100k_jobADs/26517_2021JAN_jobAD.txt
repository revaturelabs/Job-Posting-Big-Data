How could spending some hundreds of bilions of dollars not create jobs?Huh. I can't edit out that second \"greatest\".

How can the CBO claim the stimulus created a certain number of jobs without determining if it actually did or not?Although CBO has examined data on output and employment during the period since ARRA’s enactment, those data are not as helpful in determining ARRA’s economic effects as might be supposed because isolating the effects would require knowing what path the economy would have taken in the absence of the law. Because that path cannot be observed, the new data add only limited information about ARRA’s impact.Click to expand...So what they're saying is, they have no clue if the economy would have been better or worse without the stimulus. WTF?Since the CBO only issues reports when they are specifically requested, I would say that this report is nothing more than an exercise in political posturing. It's only real purpose is to give the administration some form of justification for spending 800 billion dollars that they didn't have in the first place..Last edited: Aug 25, 2010RenaeDP VeteranJoinedAug 26, 2007Messages48,389Reaction score18,084LocationSan Antonio TexasGenderFemalePolitical LeaningConservativeAug 25, 2010#5How many of those were \"Census\" jobs?Ddonsutherland1DP VeteranJoinedOct 17, 2007Messages11,772Reaction score10,081LocationNew YorkGenderMalePolitical LeaningCentristAug 25, 2010#6Grim17 said:So what they're saying is, they have no clue if the economy would have been better or worse without the stimulus. WTF?Since the CBO only issues reports when they are specifically requested, I would say that this report is nothing more than an exercise in political posturing.Click to expand...Three quick points:1. CBO used \"various mathematical models\" to assess revenue/spending-related effects to gain an understanding of the fiscal stimulus program's macroeconomic impact. Additional data related to output and employment was not helpful in assessing the macroeconomic impact for the reasons CBO stated. Moreover, CBO has no doubts that the economy would have been worse without the stimulus, as it concluded that the stimulus provided a minimum of a 1.7% boost to real GDP and 0.7 percentage point reduction to the unemployment rate.2. CBO's findings are reasonably similar to research that was recently released by economists Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi, who used separate modeling. They found that the fiscal stimulus boosted 2010 real GDP by 3.4% (CBO's estimate: 1.7% to 4.5%), kept the unemployment rate 1.5 percentage points lower (CBO's estimate: 0.7 to 1.8 percentage points lower), and added almost 2.7 million jobs to U.S. payrolls (CBO's estimate: 1.4 million to 3.3 million jobs).3. CBO is non-partisan. It responds to requests from Democratic and Republican Members of the House and Senate.Ddonsutherland1DP VeteranJoinedOct 17, 2007Messages11,772Reaction score10,081LocationNew YorkGenderMalePolitical LeaningCentristAug 25, 2010#7MrVicchio said:How many of those were \"Census\" jobs?Click to expand...CBO focused on a macroeconomic level, not microeconomic one.Ddonsutherland1DP VeteranJoinedOct 17, 2007Messages11,772Reaction score10,081LocationNew YorkGenderMalePolitical LeaningCentristAug 25, 2010#8Interestingly enough--and these numbers will probably ignite partisan passions--CBO also provided estimates as to the provisions that were most stimulative vs. those that were least stimulative. Higher multipliers = greater stimulative impact e.g., a multiplier of 1.5 means that every $1.00 of stimulus spending generated $1.50 of economic output. Hence, a 1.00 multiplier is neutral, as every $1.00 of stimulus spending would lead to a $1.00 increase in output.Mean Multiplier (average of the low and high estimate):Purchases of goods/services by the federal government: 1.75Transfer payments to state/local governments for infrastructure: 1.75Transfer payments to individuals: 1.45Transfer payments to state/local governments for other purposes: 1.25Two-year tax cuts for lower- and middle-income people: 1.05One-time payments to retirees: 0.65Extension of first-time homebuyer credit: 0.55One-year tax cut for higher income people: 0.40Corporate tax breaks: 0.20What does this mean?If the federal government chooses to pursue another stimulus package, something that cannot be ruled out, though I don't believe such a package is needed right now, it should focus on high multiplier items and completely avoid low multiplier ones. That way, each additional dollar of stimulus would have greater bang for the buck and a smaller package would be needed than if the stimulus package diverts funding to low- or even very low-multiplier items.danarheaSlayer of the DP NewsbotDP VeteranJoinedAug 27, 2005Messages43,603Reaction score26,254LocationHouston, TXGenderMalePolitical LeaningConservativeAug 25, 2010#9IMHO, any news of upticks or downticks on a per quarter basis are not going to say much for the big picture, as employment is going to be depressed for many years to come.Grim17Battle ReadyDP VeteranJoinedJul 29, 2009Messages30,315Reaction score14,358LocationSouthwestern U.S.GenderMalePolitical LeaningConservativeAug 25, 2010#10donsutherland1 said:3. CBO is non-partisan.

They are given parameters by the ones who make the request. They are told what to include in their reports, what to omit, and often told which sources they can use as a basis for them.The CBO is not allowed to broaden the scope of a report, even if in doing so, it would significantly alter their findings. That's why their reports include so many \"what if's\" and explanations for their findings.We saw this with Obamacare. Their reports prior to it's passing that were requested by the administration and democrats on capitol hill, painted a very rosy economic picture for America if the legislation were enacted. After the bill was passed, they were requested to do several other, more broad studies on the Obamacare bill, and every one that has been released so far, has contradicted or greatly reduced the positive benefits they reported initially. That's because their scope was severely limited before by the administration.Last edited: Aug 25, 2010texmasterHippie HaterDP VeteranJoinedOct 24, 2009Messages3,969Reaction score1,209LocationDallas TEXASGenderUndisclosedPolitical LeaningVery ConservativeAug 25, 2010#11The report notes, however, that the Recovery Act's effect on output will gradually diminish during the second half of 2010. The law's effect on employment and unemployment will wane gradually in 2011 and beyond.Funny how that was left out of the OP.A temporary gain means nothing. Sustained growth is the key.We also need to remember the unemployment number is well over what Obama and his liberal allies promised it would be if the stimulus was passed.Last edited: Aug 25, 2010Grim17Battle ReadyDP VeteranJoinedJul 29, 2009Messages30,315Reaction score14,358LocationSouthwestern U.S.GenderMalePolitical LeaningConservativeAug 25, 2010#12MrVicchio said:How many of those were \"Census\" jobs?Click to expand...That, and what percentage were public sector and private sector jobs is the reason I read the report in the first place.
