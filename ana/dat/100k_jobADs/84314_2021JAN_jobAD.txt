And after that I went to bathroom and touch my panty the wet side due to my own discharge and wears it again because idont have any extra that time. Could i get pregnant from that?Add a Comment1 CommentsEmpoweredHelena GuideHello, Anon. Thank you for posting.Did you have sex education at school? If not, it's a good idea to study on your own so you know how sex and the human body works. You can read books on this or search our EmpowHER site. This will eliminate a lot of stress than the unknown can cause.A woman cannot get pregnant unless she has unprotected sex (intercourse) with ejaculation that enters the vagina. The highest chance for this is during ovulation.So, a pregnancy cannot occur from the scenario you describe.best,HelenaJanuary 6, 2019 - 6:33amreplyFlag as offensiveThis CommentImproved My HealthChanged My LifeSaved My LifeDo you really want to post anonymously?Are You a Member?
