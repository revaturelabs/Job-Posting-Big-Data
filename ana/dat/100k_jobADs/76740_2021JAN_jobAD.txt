After missing a host of chances, they were relieved to share a point with Blackburn Rovers.Victory would have sent them top; instead they only moved level on points with leaders Leeds, who play at Swansea today, and have third-placed Brentford breathing down their necks.West Brom still need seven more points to guarantee automatic promotion and have three games to do it, beginning at home to Fulham on Tuesday.“Up until they scored, I was very pleased with the performance, but you have to kill the game off,” Bilic said. “You don’t create that number of great chances very often. But if you don’t take them, you always run the risk of conceding.“Then in the last 20 minutes, the game became too stretched and they had a couple of great chances. But I’m frustrated we didn’t win.”Matheus Pereira was at the heart of all West Brom’s fine early moves and there was no surprise when he was involved in the opening goal.The Brazilian got to the byline and found Austin, who spotted Filip Krovinovic free at the back post and the Croatian volleyed his side ahead.Two of four substitutes made by Blackburn manager Tony Mowbray in the 61st minute, Sam Gallagher and Joe Rothwell combined for the latter to bring his side level.“It was a time for big calls,” said Mowbray, referring to his quadruple change. “They were on top and we needed to change the flow of the game. We gambled and it paid off.”Post navigationPrevious Post Previous post:UFC 251: Kamaru Usman vs. Jorge Masvidal live blog, results, highlights from Fight IslandNext Post Next post:Mixed reaction from Hong Kong expats to UK visa offerSaadView all posts by Saad →You might also likeHayward Returns to Celtics for Game 3 of East FinalsSeptember 20, 2020From ‘master bedroom’ to ‘blacklist’: What will it take to change racist terms in our everyday language?July 8, 2020‘Beautiful, peaceful and diverse’: Thousands of protesters flood streets near White HouseJune 7, 2020Coronavirus: India to extend nationwide lockdown, state minister saysApril 11, 2020Report: Buccaneers Expected to Bring Back QB Jame is Winston in 2020December 22, 2019 December 22, 2019Coronavirus: Government unveils £1.3bn scheme to help start-upsApril 20, 2020Deewangi – Episode 08 || English Subtitles || 5th Feb 2020 – HAR PAL GEO HAR PAL GEOFebruary 5, 2020Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
