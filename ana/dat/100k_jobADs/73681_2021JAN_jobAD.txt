Career transitions and entrepreneurshipBy Kornel Szrejber0 CommentsSeptember 5, 2018Today’s guest is Alex Grodnik from Wall Street Oasis which easily one of the largest and best sites out there for anybody looking to have a career on Bay Street or Wall Street.They offer a ton of great resources for anybody looking to either start, or transition to a career in finance, and what’s interesting is that pretty much everybody that I’ve talked to who I respect in this field has used Wall Street Oasis to help them break into the industry, so I think that’s a good testament to the high quality educational content that they provide.Alex also hosts their podcast which is called “Moving Up”, but what’s also really interesting about him is he actually quit his really well paying job on Wall Street to start his own business, so I thought this would also be a great episode for anybody who is maybe a little dissatisfied with their job, and is considering a career transition.We talk about why he decided to quit, his top advice for somebody looking to earn some money on the side through their own business, how he’s learned to handle rejection really well and use that to propel his career, and much more.It was an absolute blast to talk with Alex, the interview went great, and I’m sure you’ll like it.
