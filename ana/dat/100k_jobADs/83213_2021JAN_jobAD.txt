We have already seen the Los Angeles Rams and the Jacksonville Jaguars fire their head coaches in Jeff Fisher and Gus Bradley and they will more than likely be a ton of other head coaches who are fired at season’s end.One of the names being mentioned as more than likely being fired is Rex Ryan in Buffalo. When a coach is being rumored to be fired, the reports of replacements start to come out. However, in the case for the Buffalo Bills, they have their eyes set on one specific coach to replace the former Jets coach. According to reports, the “front-runner” to land the Buffalo Bills job is former New York Giants head coach Tom Coughlin, who will be seventy-one years old to start the 2017 season. However, it seems that Coughlin’s name is also being brought up for the Jacksonville Jaguars position, which was the team he coached in the late 1990’s.[embedit snippet=”Jon ads”]According to the report, it seems the conversations began a few weeks ago and there happens to be mutual interest from both parties. However, unlike other coaches of Coughlin’s stature, Coughlin is said to be eager to get back on the sidelines of an NFL team and will jump at the first offer presented to him. This may also be why the Bills are so quick to move away from Rex Ryan. Tom Coughlin was last on an NFL sideline last season as he was the head coach of the New York Giants since 2004.Personally, I feel this will be a beneficial move for the Bills to bring in someone like Coughlin who has winning experience. Also, it should be noted that the Bills have not won the AFC East since 1995 and have not been in the playoffs since 1999 when they lost the Wild Card game to the Tennessee Titans.This is a rumor and should be taken with a grain of salt.Facebook Comments:Share this:TweetPrintWhatsAppLike this:Like Loading...RelatedPrevious StoryWWE Rumors: AJ Styles, Samoa Joe to ...Next StoryWWE Rumor killer: AJ Styles, Randy Orton ...0Shares0+0000Jon BlayneJon has been writing since June of 2016.
