Previously I have worked in many areas: Emergency surgery in the Countess of Chester, I then transferred to SaTH to work on a surgical rotation including: Vascular, Surgical Assessment Unit and Escalation. A secondment opportunity (temporary transfer of a member of staff to another role) was made for DSU Escalation Sister.“A typical day includes: handover of patient care from the previous shift, co-ordinating staff and patients that are coming in, managing pre op and post op patients, and liaising with teams through ward rounds to enhance safe and appropriate discharges.“My favourite part of the day is meeting new patients/staff and making their experience in hospital a smooth and easy process. My biggest achievement so far is getting to the position I am today.“Out of work I love walking and socialising with friends and family.”BackShare ThisTestimonials“I trained at Shrewsbury Hospital and I love working in A&E, … I absolutely love the challenge, it’s a very diverse job and you never get the same thing twice in a day, that’s what I really enjoy about it. ”A&E Sister, Shrewsbury“You realise how nice it is here, and what a family atmosphere we have in this hospital. A lot of people have worked here a long time, and we all know each other really well in comparison to a huge place that is a little bit faceless”Consultant Radiographer, Shrewsbury“It’s so beautiful, its quiet and the people are lovely. It’s completely different to the atmosphere in a city. We're a family and I think that is reflected throughout the hospital.”A&E Health Care Assistant, ShrewsburyBack to topThe Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS TrustHomeNewsContact UsFollow usTwitterFacebookLinkedInYoutubeSign up for Job AlertsEmailPlease do not fill in the above field to help us identify genuine requests.Your email addressI would like to subscribe to email alerts so I can hear more about the great jobs at The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust.>SubmitNHS PartnershipProud to CareNHS PartnershipProud to Care© The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust 2021 | Important Information About This SiteWebsite by ClearGet SocialGet regular updates about SaTH; including job alerts, recruitment events, news about our staff and hospitals and to find out what it is like to live and work in Shropshire and the surrounding areas, please follow us on our social networks.Sign up for alertsEmailPlease do not fill in the above field to help us identify genuine requests.Your email addressI would like to subscribe to email alerts so I can hear more about the great jobs at The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust.>RegisterFollow usTwitterFacebookGoogle+LinkedInNo Thanks"
