I wouldn’t say that I was the best shoe salesperson around, but I do sell a lot of shoes. I feel like I can thank the excellent climate control system for most of the shoe sales. People come in often on a really hot day, and the air conditioning just feels so nice. People can remain in the store for a long time just taking it easy and trying on different shoes. The shoes basically sell themselves because we have a great collection for reasonable prices. If the climate control system wasn’t working so good though, I doubt people would stick around and try on so many shoes. When people tell me what they are looking for, I am pretty good at finding just the right shoes for them. I have always had an appreciation of different shoe styles, and I have tons of shoes at home. That’s another huge plus for working at a shoe store, the employee discounts! I don’t even mind when I’m asked to work overtime hours because the air conditioning always feels so wonderful. I feel like I can stay at work forever and still have a good time talking to different customers and other co-workers. I think everybody at the shoe store enjoys working there, and they appreciate the employee discounts as much as I do. The thing that is really great is the fact that we have a powerful UV air purification system. This makes the air quality superb and we don’t have to worry so much about germs spreading around because the UV light kills them.space heaterPost navigationPrevious Previous post:Next Next post:Related PostsHe’s simply the bestNovember 19, 2020This kitty stinksNovember 19, 2020CategoriesHVAC ThermostatsMetaLog inEntries feedComments feedWordPress.org© All Right Reserved	Proudly powered by WordPress | Theme: Bloge by Canyon Themes."
