After being with the same company for 15 years, I am so glad I did! CV assistance soon turned into invaluable career coaching. I would highly recommend Sean and ITCV Writers to anyone who is in the job market, considering a career change, wanting to bring out their best and stand out from the crowd! Thank you again.\"Matt Di PietroSales ExecutiveRating:\"Initially, I was hesitant to use another resume writing service. I had used another big-name provider who seemed to be competently out of touch with my specialty and what was produced was unusable. But after consulting colleagues I decided to go ahead. Ben and Sean spend a lot of time at the outset to extract the required information. This is hard work on both sides. I can honestly say I am proud of the result and will be using this format for years to come. Ben and Sean truly do go above and beyond, highly recommended. I am sure time will tell but I think this is some of the best money I have ever spent. \"Nick BrittVoice/UC Solution ArchitectRating:\"I highly recommend ITCV services to anyone wanting to ensure that your CV and LinkedIn Profile is on point so you have many opportunities to get interviews.

Having worked in the recruitment industry for many years, it was great to work with professionals who have a different view on the areas of importance when job seeking. The team work in an open and collaborative way, allowing me to truly get the best experience from their services. With the great positive response I've had from my new CV, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending ITCV to anyone who feels they need assistance. \"Chris MonkAccount ManagerRating:\"Sean did an amazing job redoing my LinkedIn profile.

Within 5 days of having my Linkedin profile re-written by Sean I was inundated with agents reaching out with opportunities. A fast and professional service.\"Steve BucklerSenior Systems EngineerRating:\"Sean's excellent resume tools, professional & friendly approach, collaborative approach and personable nature make him a cut above the rest. I tried 2 other resume writers & CV coaches who pushed me through their CV model, they left me unsure and without a positive interview framework. Recruiters were very impressed with the CV Sean created & he gave me the practical tools to nail it in interviews. Sean provided me with a future, not just a CV.\"Andrew WierzbickiInfrastructure ManagerRating:\"I approached Sean for help with updating my CV.
