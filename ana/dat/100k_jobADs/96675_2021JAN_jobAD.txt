We are using artificial diamonds to convert and tailor the light output from conventional laser sources, with a particular focus on creating versatile narrow-band and single-longitudinal-mode lasers for applications such as chemical detection and quantum control. We are funded in part by M Squared Lasers, a UK laser company, so that our research outcomes can be quickly translated to real-world applications. There will be opportunity to travel and collaborate with this partner.The scholarships cover the national/international fees (International: 32,000AUD/yr), and provides an annual stipend of ~25,000AUD. The PhD provides approx 15,000AUD for travel and research costs.DEADLINE May 20 2017To apply please email a CV.
