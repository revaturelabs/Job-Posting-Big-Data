"Ferry – gizzajobblogSkip to contentgizzajobblogFinding work where it's easier to find a needle in a haystack!Ferry	Weekend in Glasgow, plus other thingsPosted on September 18, 2017 by gizzajob	The weekend just past I took a cross-ferry coach from Belfast to Glasgow to see the Paul Draper gig at King Tut’s Wah-Wah Hut. The night before I left I only had two and a bit hours sleep and had a long day afterwards. On the coach from Cairnryan to Glasgow – en route to Edinburgh – I was sick on the twisty cliff roads heading to Ayr. I went to the toilet to be sick and lost my balance. The coach driver was pissed off at me – wondering why ‘A Grown Man’ would leave such a mess – but at Ayr a woman getting off there let me have the rest of her water bottle so I could get a Co-Codamol in me. That – plus frantic prayer – got me to Glasgow without barfing again.The main issue was eating too much on the ferry. I had a fish supper, plus a few other nibbles. But on the way home I only ate a light breakfast; granola with yoghurt and milk plus a cappuccino. Also, I bought two bottles of water for Co-Codamols and I didn’t barf yesterday at all.On the way over at Saturday morning, I spoke to a guy from Lisburn who is heading to Ayr to star in a pantomime. We had a good conversation about how the British mock our Northern Ireland accent whenever we head there. Also, I was talking to a couple from Leicester on the ferry to Cairnryan on Saturday and they met Mark Selby – the World Snooker Champion from Leicester – and showed me a picture of him on their phone.Also, there were quite a few from Quebec who went on the same coach from Belfast on Saturday as me, then on the ferry back to Belfast, I spoke to another couple from Quebec who rented a car from London and were driving across Britain and Ireland. Plus I got to see the last twenty-odd minutes of the All-Ireland Final. Heartbreak for Mayo; what’s new?The gig itself went well but left early due to having a long day. But getting sleep on Saturday night really lifted my mood on Sunday morning.Tunes:Tagged Ayr, Belfast, Cairnryan, Eminem, Ferry, Glasgow, Ireland, King Tuts Wah Wah Hut, Mansun, Northern Ireland, Paul Draper, Scotland, Travel, Travel Sickness, Travis, United KingdomLeave a comment	Going by Coach to Glasgow, then Train to LondonPosted on March 28, 2017 by gizzajob	Last Friday I went to Belfast to get a cross-ferry Coach to Glasgow then get a train to London Euston. In the end my ferry was delayed and then I got questioned by Police at Cairnryan Port asking me if I was ‘reported missing’. However the Police check gave me the all clear. 🙂Then I was able to walk from Buchanan Street Bus Station to Glasgow Central Train station and had to board a Train terminating at Birmingham. However, there was a delay on the train for a couple of hours prior to Lockerbie, how ironic, due to a suspected broken line. In the end our train terminated at Preston and we had to get a train there which terminated at Birmingham and then Virgin Rail had to provide taxis, which they paid for, to take people towards onward journeys. I was with four others heading to Euston; including two young women – one from Egypt and the other from Romania – who showed me how to get 4G working on my phone. It was a real Kumbaya moment.On the train I boarded at Preston, I was talking to a loved-up drunk Geezer who was off to Birmingham to see his family for Mother’s Day. (Solihull to be precise) It was one of those serendipitous moments where we got to talk about music and he played ‘Justified and Ancient’ by the KLF; I was twelve years-old again. 🙂After only two and a half hours sleep at the B and B I booked at Earl’s Court, the booking was only about £15 more than the taxi I had to get from Euston to Earl’s Court, I had some toast at the dining place and had to get a Tube to Victoria to head to Brighton. In the end I enjoyed Brighton and got to visit a Skype buddy from there. It was great, having Fish and Chips along the beach. Before that, I met other friends and had a cappuccino with a heart symbol which looked like a power symbol. 🙂On the way back, I managed to get the first train from Euston to Glasgow. Then I got to be on the coach to Belfast, there were enough free seats for the driver to accept my open return, but I was sick on the way back. But I managed to get a bus to Castledawson park-and-ride and a taxi home; one of the few taxi services in the area who operates on Sunday Night.These past few days I have been playing catch-up. But I am glad that I’m managing things. 🙂 Plus Virgin promise to refund my ticket as well as the additional taxi I had to get. Photocopied my receipts on my printer and then scanned the copy in PDF format to email to them. 🙂Tagged Birmingham, Brighton, Cairnryan, Camaraderie, Coach, Delays, Ferry, Glasgow, London, Refund, Security Checkpoints, Serendipity, Taxi, Travel, Travel Sickness, Virgin RailLeave a comment	Haiku list from my journey last weekendPosted on March 28, 2017 March 29, 2017 by gizzajob	Ferry was delayed!Irish Sea not seaworthy!Anxiety high!Police questioned me!“Were you reported missing?”Police check cleared me!Frustrated on coach!Crying toddler next to me!Off at Craigtara!Train halted for so long!Inspecting a broken line!Over two hours!Drunk stoner on train!Played ‘Justified and Ancient’!Towards Birmingham!Taxi to London!Starts at Birmingham New Street!Got to use 4G!“Where were you drinking?”Asked by drunk blade from Oxford!Outside a Waitrose!Earl’s Court Tube Station!Heading on towards Brighton!From VictoriaLib Dem Supporters!EU Gladrags on display!Had to bite my tongue!Need to get a bin!No bin at Victoria!Had to go outside!On train to Brighton!Had to stop at Three Bridges!Then substitute bus!Outside in Brighton!Gorgeous Saturday weather!At the Love Café!Got cappuccino!Heart sign like Power Symbol!Made me laugh out loud!Tube back to Earl’s Court!Blade almost ran into me!Like a Cattle herd!Sick on coach back!Between Ayr and Cairnryan!Eating far too much!Got earlier bus!Castledawson park-and-ride!Rearranged taxi!Tagged Birmingham, Brighton, Cairnryan, Coach, Delays, England, Ferry, Glasgow, Haiku, London, Northern Ireland, Police Checks, Scotland, Serendipity, Train, Travel, Travel Sickness, United Kingdom, Virgin RailLeave a comment	Blog at WordPress.com.Add your thoughts here...
