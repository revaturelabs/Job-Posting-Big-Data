For example, if you have an offer from another school, but you might prefer an offer from us, then we definitely want to know that. And that's a situation where you genuinely need to know where you stand with us, because it might affect how you respond to that other school's offer.But a lot of candidates ask when they don't have any good reason; they're just nervous and want to know something, even if there's nothing they'll be able to do with that information. That looks bad, because it's immature. It's the equivalent of a little kid in the back of the car asking \"Are we there yet?\" I don't want to sound unsympathetic: we know the job market is nerve-wracking (just like I know my kid has a hard time sitting in his car seat for an hour). But try to act like a grown-up and be patient.8 years ago # QUOTE 3 Jab 3 No Jab !Economistf2dfTrue- it shouldn't hurt you if you ask once, perhaps in mid-February. If you ask in mid-January, or 3 times, we won't want to work with you.8 years ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 2 No Jab !Economist6127Another demand side here: it CAN hurt you, depending on whether you have a good reason to ask.

At this point the only rational thing for the demand side to do is not to infer too much from them.8 years ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economistac28How about asking about the offer decision? I guess I am not on the top of their list, and my chance arises when the one ahead of me declines. Should I ask then? I also have offers from less preferred places.8 years ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist95f2Demand Side: Will you ever just relax and stop being so awesome?
