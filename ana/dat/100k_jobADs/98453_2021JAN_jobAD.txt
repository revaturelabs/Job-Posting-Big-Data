In addition to providing basic nursing care, LTC travel nurses administer medications to patients, ensure that patients receive the appropriate and safe medical care they need, and coordinate patient care.Long-term care nurses work with patients who suffer from chronic physical and/or mental conditions. These patients are primarily in the geriatric age group. Practice settings generally include skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes.Nurses who provide care in the long-term setting can also work at another type of facility which is known as a long-term acute care hospital (LTACHs). These facilities specialize in the treatment of patients who suffer from very serious medical conditions. It’s a complex situation that these patients are in, in which they still require ongoing care, but no longer require or qualify for hospital care which provides intensive care and diagnostic services.On average, patients stay at an LTACH facility for 30 days at a time, but some patients require much longer lengths of stay. Patients who are discharged from a hospital but require more intensive care than what is provided at home or skilled nursing facilities often end up in LTACHs. There is a wide range of patients who go to these types of facilities, including those who are recovering from a very severe injury or accident, those who are living with disabilities, people suffering from progressive illnesses, such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease, and people who suffer from chronic health conditions such as coronary artery disease and obesity.Nurses who work in both LTACHs and LTCs are responsible for providing the day-to-day needs of the patient, the operation of the medical facility, supervision of staff, delegation of tasks to unlicensed personnel, assessment of medical care progress and outcomes, and the delivery of excellent customer service to patients and family members.In order to be successful as an LTC nurse, one must exercise a high degree of patience, as it can be quite challenging to work with patients who have these medical conditions and chronic illnesses. If you are a nurse working at an LTACH, advanced and often intensive nursing skills are required because these facilities can have patients who are on ventilators, feeding tubes, continuous cardiac monitoring, and other intensive medical care regimens.Job Skills / Requirements:Valid BLS from the American Heart AssociationA valid professional license within the state of practiceAdvanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) credentialing through the American Heart Association is recommended and may be required for specific registered nurses and travel nurse positionsOther specialty-related certifications are preferred and may be required for specific positionsProof of right to work in the United StatesExperience as a long-term care nurseLTC Travel Nurse Salary and Job OutlookThere has never been a higher demand for nurses who work in long-term care.
