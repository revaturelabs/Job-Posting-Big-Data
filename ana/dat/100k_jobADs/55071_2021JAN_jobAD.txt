(Employers)My 3 P’s of the Perfect Job | by Bobby Ghoshal, Head of Digital Design at WeWork, New York.By Editor -Jul 21, 201620410SHAREFacebookTwittertweetA friend asked me, “What are the things that make a job worth staying in for the long haul?” a bit of thought allowed me to simplify my answer into the trifecta above –purpose, people and pay (at the time I think I said mission, people and money but that doesn’t have the same ring does it?) I don’t believe you can reach true employment bliss until you’ve clearly got all three.PurposeThe purpose is why you show up to work every day. You’ve got a mission, you believe in that mission, it aligns with your personal “why” and it gets you out of bed with a smile every morning. You think about the mission all the time, you research it, you read books about it, you get folks around you excited about it, and you get excited about getting folks around you excited about it. The purpose is the foundation of the trifecta. When you look at a prospective company, consider their purpose FIRST. If the people and pay are in alignment but the purpose isn’t, you’ll get bored and the surest way to take the buzz out of something is to get bored with it.PeopleThe people are who you show up to work for everyday. People aren’t just peers and co-workers, its the customers too. Ideally you’ll pick a company with people that have a track record of execution, integrity, and success. With the right people, you’ll let your guard down and allow yourself to get mentored. You’ll be less worried about being right and you’ll spend more time wanting to learn and share. As you develop personal relationships with these people, your interactions with them will increase in quality. The quality of your interactions tend to define the quality of your leadership, it yields more trust and mutual respect. That kind of thing tends to make you want to stick around for the long haul.PayFor the life of me I don’t understand why pay is so taboo to discuss with employers. Pay isn’t just about the quantity of money you get paid to do your best work. Pay is validation, when you get paid more, the person on the other end of the table is acknowledging your value and rewarding you for execution and experience. Pay is also an important optic for new employers. They will create a first impression on the quality of the candidate (you) based on how much they ask for and/or how much their previous employer paid them. If you are less interested in “pay” in the form of money, there are other ways to get paid. If you are in your first job, experience trumps money. Take the hit on money, work for someone that can mentor you and become a sponge for their experience. That experience is worth a lot more than the cold hard cash they will pay you for your time. If you work for a startup, you’ll be more likely to take your pay in stocks. If you work for a non-profit or are in social work, pay in cash might be less important to you than pay in karma… Come on who am I kidding? When is pay not that important to anyone? it is important, so don’t sideline it.The Bottom LinePeople + Purpose — Pay: You could be happy at this company but monetary stress will wear you down over time.Purpose + Pay — People: You could be happy at this company for a little while until you realize that life is too short to spend with people that suck.Pay + People — Purpose: You shouldn’t stick around this company for too long, this is a good inbetweener job.Purpose — People — Pay: A great way to get your early footing in an industry of interest but this is not long term viable.Pay — Purpose — People: Don’t do it just for the money, life’s too short and you’ll be miserable.People — Purpose — Pay: The people at this company better be like family or else you’ll be miserable at this company.– Purpose — People — Pay: If I’m being honest, this one is a tough sell all around.Purpose + People + Pay: You hit the jack pot. Start funding your pension, 401k, and IRA. Plan to be here for a long time because these companies are few and far between.Source- Medium.CommentscommentsTAGSproductivityworkplace tipsworkplace tips employersSHAREFacebookTwittertweetPrevious article20 little habits that will help you live a better life!Next articleTop 30 content writing internships and fresher jobs of the week!EditorRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORInternship Tips: How To Be The Best Intern And Stand OutIntern-worthy skills: How to develop self-management skills?Success Tips: How To Focus On Work In This World Of Distractions5 Habits That Might Be Killing Your Productivity: Workplace TipsInternship Cues | Why You Need To Network With The People You WorkThings You Can Actually Do To Be More Productive In Your Student LifeNO COMMENTSComments are closed.LETSINTERN.COMSTAY CONNECTED0FansLike0FollowersFollow0FollowersFollowEDITOR PICKSValue of a Letter of Recommendation From Your InternshipShilpa Kulkarni -May 13, 20195 Hottest Summer Internships You Should Be Looking At This SeasonVani Raj -May 9, 2019Benefits of doing startup internships during collegeShilpa Kulkarni -Apr 23, 2019Top 6 HR Internships In 2019 You Can’t Afford To Misspriyanka -Mar 11, 2019Request for the Letsintern NewsletterGet free email delivery of The Letsintern newsletters for career opportunities, interview hacks & tips, professional tips and much more.SubscribeFollowSubscribe to notificationsRecent PostsValue of a Letter of Recommendation From Your Internship5 Hottest Summer Internships You Should Be Looking At This SeasonHow to tell if your internship will be a successLetsintern.comLetsintern Blog is dedicated to enabling students across the world by assisting them to discover and connect with their passion.Contact us: blog@letsintern.comEVEN MORE NEWSValue of a Letter of Recommendation From Your InternshipMay 13, 20195 Hottest Summer Internships You Should Be Looking At This SeasonMay 9, 2019How to tell if your internship will be a successApr 26, 2019POPULAR CATEGORYWeekly Internship Features550Career Development430Opportunities Spotlight347Daily Hot Picks269Tech World239College Life210Understanding Careers206© Letsintern.com© A Part Of Aspiring MindsDisclaimerPrivacyAdvertisementContact us"
