These neighborhoods have high rates of youth unemployment, poverty, juvenile crime, and low graduation rates. Some interpret that as daunting. We interpret that as potential for transformative impact.We believe this impact can translate to the neighborhood level as we take our program to scale. As our ability to employ youth expands, our target neighborhoods will expand as well.Eligible NeighborhoodsSee a full list of eligible (target) city neighborhoods and county municipalities below.

For many of our youth, their experience at STL Youth Jobs is their first job and this skill-building is critical. Employers receive job-ready youth, and youth are equipped with skills that will serve them for a lifetime. This trainings includes:Financial literacy: understanding core components of budgeting, money management, how to handle checks and cash, and opening a checking account.Essential skills: how to dress for work, navigate coworker relationships, improve interpersonal skills, handle conflict, and professional presentation.Job readiness: how to assemble a resume, fill out an application, search for jobs, network, and approach interviews.Step 3: EmployOnce a youth is ready for work, we connect them with valuable employment experience. These employers receive job-ready youth. Employers provide any specialized training, employment oversight, and feedback. Our job coaches support both youth and employers every step of the way to ensure their experience is successful. Youth are employed by one of three methods:Area of interest – during our assessment phase we help a youth identify viable career trajectories and interests. We do our best to connect them to experience in this field.Demand-driven skillbuilding – we work in tandem with the Department of Labor and the Chamber of Commerce to identify areas of growing demand in our region. We strategically deploy youth in these areas of growing demand so that by the time they graduate, they are ready to work in industries that are ready to hire them.Local businesses – in some cases, the most important success factor for youth is proximity. We connect these youth with local businesses who are an important part of the fabric of their community.Step 4: Follow Up & SupportFrom the earliest stages of the program, youth are connected to a job coach who is committed to their success. This coach provides the initial assessment, works with both youth and employers throughout the duration of the program to ensure success and support, and provides ongoing support throughout the program to help youth accomplish their short-term employment goals while setting them up to accomplish their long-term goals.All this effort produces measurable results, which external evaluators collect and review with us.Take a lookA civic collaboration providing meaningful employment opportunities for at-risk youth in St. Louis, MOContact UsKey Ways to Get Involved:InvestFund our program. $2,500 = 1 Youth JobEmployHire youth for the summerAlignHelp us prioritize youth employmentApplySubmit an application to join our programYouth Applications Open!
