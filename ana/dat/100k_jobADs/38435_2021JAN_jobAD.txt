Awards will be given to students in professional training, certificate programs and two-year degree programs.“These incredibly generous gifts will give people the opportunity to do fulfilling work that increases their families’ economic security and helps them contribute to and sustain New Hampshire’s communities and economy,” said Richard Ober, president and CEO of the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation. “These scholarships are life-changers for New Hampshire families, and will help meet critical workforce needs in New Hampshire.”Scholarships will be awarded to people working to earn high-value credentials in high-demand fields, including traditional trades, advanced manufacturing, financial services, health care and information technology. The program focuses on students who experience barriers to opportunity: New Americans, those with significant financial need, and students who are the first in their families to attend college.Bob Rivers, Chair and CEO of Eastern Bank, said, “This partnership represents the perfect alignment of Eastern’s mission as a social enterprise and the needs of business. Helping students who are the first in their family to attend college, for example, gain access to opportunity through education and workforce training is not only the ‘right thing’ to do, but also the ‘smart thing’ to do, as we and other businesses depend upon the further growth and vibrancy of the workforce and our communities throughout New Hampshire.”Eastern Bank Charitable Foundation has made more than $2.7 million in grants to approximately 300 New Hampshire nonprofits since 2015, and has donated 10 percent of its net income to charity over 10 years. It has focused significant recent grantmaking towards supporting immigrants in our communities.“Without immigration, the population and economy of New England would not be growing,” Rivers said. “As they always have been, New Americans are a very significant economic and cultural driver without which the health of our communities would be in peril.”The New Hampshire Charitable Foundation will administer the scholarships through its student aid program. The Charitable Foundation is New Hampshire’s statewide community foundation and the largest provider of publicly available student aid in New Hampshire, awarding more than $6 million to some 1,600 New Hampshire students each year. Students may apply through the Charitable Foundation’s online application: www.nhcf.org/medallionfund.About the New Hampshire Charitable FoundationThe New Hampshire Charitable Foundation is New Hampshire’s statewide community foundation, founded in 1962 by and for the people of New Hampshire.
