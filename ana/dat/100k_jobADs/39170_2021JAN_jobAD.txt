"Planning News and Jobs | Planning Portal BlogSkip to contentFollow:RSSTwitterPlanning Portal BlogHomeAbout this blogImportant news for LPAsTagsjobs, portal 2.0, re-design, web 2.0Planning News and Jobsby Portal Director on	March 4, 2009	I’ve set up a pageflakes site that pulls together lots of planning news and jobs feeds into one place.Firstly it will save you time as you’ll be able to get all your news in one hit secondly it will give you an idea of the way we’re heading with the next iteration of the Planning Portal. On the site you will be able to look at jobs for example from 3 different web sites at the same time, the same with news.Ignore the look (it’s not pretty) but consider the functionality. Portal 2.0 will have something of the look of the BBC site with the functionality of pageflakes. Bringing together form and function into one harmonious whole….whoops, sorry went a bit Grand Designs there.You will need to register for PageFlakes but I gaurantee when you do you will find lots of uses for it.Let me know if there are other sites out there you’d like to be added to the pages.Share this:TwitterLinkedInLike this:Like Loading...RelatedFrom → Content News, Improving the PortalLeave a CommentPlease give us your feedback but we won’t publish any comments that are not constructive or that criticise any individual, any named business or any local authority.
