Should you let a client work on the job they‚Äôve hired you and your company to build?There are several reasons that clients tell you they want to do some of their own work. Almost all boil down to money. They are willing to trade their time to do the work to reduce the big bucks you‚Äôll charge them. Or perhaps they‚Äôve been watching TV and someone built their own room addition or remodeled their kitchen in a day. It looked so easy, obviously anyone can do it. Your client is thinking, ‚ÄúWhy not me?‚ÄùSome contractors will say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs their job, I can‚Äôt stop them from working on it!‚Äù There probably is some truth in that. Others will say, ‚ÄúNot in this life, buddy. Been there, done that, have too many t-shirts.‚ÄùWhat do you do when you get this request from a potential client?A client may have the skills to do a certain part of the job. Perhaps they are a licensed electrician and want to do all the standard and low voltage wiring for their new room addition. They understand blueprints, sticking to a job schedule, keeping the job clean and have all of their own tools. You start the job and when it is their turn they slide right in and do a good job, stay on schedule and keep the job clean. Everything is done the way you would like it done, and the end result is a happy client.This can happen. If your communication is good right up front and they understand what you expect, it can be a good experience for all concerned.There could be other issues that are not readily apparent. Maybe the guy told his wife that he can install windows as well as you can, and now his ego is on the line. With careful questioning you can find out just how much he does know. If he has more ego than sense, you might make him a real hero by passing along some simple suggestions on how he can do the work to your standard. So it‚Äôs possible that this could turn out okay.But it can go the other way. Letting your clients work on your projects could be asking for delays, damaged or lost tools, disappearing materials and a meaningless job schedule. A major risk is the potential lawsuit when the client runs the saw through their hand. It will be your fault because you failed to provide proper training and supervision. Or if the client drops a beam on their foot. It will be your fault because you didn‚Äôt train them on the proper way to lift and handle heavy materials.I can hear the attorney for the plaintiff now. ‚ÄúNo one in their right mind would supply dangerous equipment for use by an untrained individual.‚ÄùLet‚Äôs say your client decides they want you to build the basic structure for the new deck, but they want to install the joists, decking, steps and hand railings. They install the decking with the supports at 48‚Ä≥ on centers, or they cut the horses with several different rises. The inspector red tags the job. Whose fault do you think it will be? This very scenario happened last year to a contractor we know and their client refused to pay the final payments on the job. Why? It was the contractor‚Äôs negligence and lack of training of the homeowner that caused the problem.Let me pass along the best advice I can give based on my experience. It is the wise and prudent contractor who tells their potential client, ‚ÄúYou can do all the work on your job you wish either before we get here or after we leave. My (pick one: insurance, schedule, attitude, accountant, attorney, wife, corporation) does not allow me to do jobs where clients will be working the job. We will be glad to build your job for you, but not as a joint venture.‚Äù‚ÄúLove all, trust a few, do wrong to none.‚Äù ‚Äî William ShakespeareFollow This ThreadConnect withNotify ofnew follow-up comments new replies to my commentsI allow to use my email address and send notification about new comments and replies (you can unsubscribe at any time).{}[+]Name*Email*Website{}[+]Name*Email*Website0 CommentsInline FeedbacksView all commentsRecent ArticlesWrapping Up a Difficult ProjectJanuary 20, 2021Habits for SuccessJanuary 6, 2021Plan for SurvivalDecember 16, 2020Construction Websites that Generate LeadsDecember 2, 2020Why Do You Need a Written Construction Contract?November 11, 2020Charging a Fair PriceOctober 28, 2020Lowball Pricing in ConstructionOctober 14, 2020Specialty Contractors and Down PaymentsSeptember 30, 2020Remodeling Sales: Setting the BudgetSeptember 16, 2020The Skinny on Change Work OrdersSeptember 2, 2020Building a Successful Construction BusinessAugust 19, 2020Family Matters More Than BusinessAugust 5, 2020You Have Better Things to Do than EstimateJuly 22, 2020Clients and Your Job ScheduleJuly 8, 2020Who Pays for On-the-Job Training?June 24, 2020Comments We‚Äôve ReceivedI wanted to take a moment and reach out to you and say thank you for taking the time to educate us.

It‚Äôs been my go to site since I stumbled across it.October 2020The event was so amazing ‚Äì I‚Äôm not a contractor or remodeler but I fully paid attention. I love Michael‚Äôs feistiness. It was refreshing.September 2020Thank you so much to yourself and Michael for putting together this course which I have just watched! I am in absolute awe of your experience and knowledge! When Michael stated in the course he has been estimating since 1969, I said to myself, \"Wow, he is a legend\"!September 2020I have been a huge fan of yours for several years.

They were full of very helpful information and presented well. I would definitely join in on any future classes.July, 2020One of the first things I did when I went out on my own was read Markup and Profit and those lessons have been a large part of why I'm still in business. I have referred it to several other contractors and I know it has helped many, many people and business get established/become profitable.May, 2020I just started using FTE this week. I'm very pleased with how simple yet effective it is. I've used THOUSANDS of dollars worth of estimating software over the years and most recently Hometech. The latter was the best but very quirky/difficult to customize the database!

The class and book have been a blessing to my career in the construction industry. Thank you, thank you thank you!March, 2020I have been a massive fan of your valuable work since I first got in touch and took delivery of your Mark Up and Profit book many years ago.

The information was awesome and you helped me add to my list of things I want to be doing for the business.March, 2020I've been with the company since the very beginning and we've been huge fans of your work! Lucky for us, my boss stumbled on your materials early in this endeavor . . . Your books and proposal writer software have been a wonderful resource for us.February, 2020I would like to tell you how thankful I am that you guys‚Äô life journey brought you to educating contractors on the business of construction. . . . When I would have questions about how to price the work, what to do when etc., I would google it. When I would get in to quality information it would invariably be one of your websites. Once I noticed the trend of where the good info was coming from, I purchased markup and profit. That book has served as the manual for running this company. It has been a priceless resource for me so thank you very much.February, 2020I‚Äôve been a huge fan of CPR for years and I want to thank you for everything your company has done for the construction community. CPR articles are frequently discussed during our Team meetings.February, 2020Thank you for your support and help.

Even though I've been a \"Stoner\" for over four years now, I took two pages of notes and it was such a helpful hour.January, 2020I was at your seminar in Woodland, CA last year and I found all the information I received invaluable in my business. It fully turned around my pricing and sales game. I can't thank you enough.January, 2020Over the past few years we've read your books and watched your online tutorials. You've changed our approach to the way we do business and we can't thank you enough. It's not easy in the construction industry and Markup & Profit has been like a bible for us.January, 2020I am a landscape contractor . . .

Although it takes a little time, in the end, my success will be partly attributed to CPR . . . I see light at the end of the tunnel, I have used this once so far on a job won, $160,000. total estimate, during 12 weeks, my employees and myself took home paychecks, paid subs, bought materials, without ever having to 'Finance' the job . . .October, 2019Just wanted to also say that Your teachings really have changed my business for the best. We are finally able to grow because we are making enough money to do so. I'm very glad I stopped listening to the idiots preaching the ‚Äúindustry standard‚Äù as far as markup and profit. Thanks again for all that you and your wife do.September, 2019I have been a subscriber to your newsletters for years. Want to first take a moment to thank you for all your insights in the industry.

It's allowed us to fine tune and we're looking forward to continued growth.September, 2019We've been happily using the contract writer software for many many years nowAugust, 2019Your books and online training courses have been absolutely instrumental in getting our business on the right track. Thanks!

The last one I attended I got more great information. . . . I also came away with one more thing: You guys are sincere, straightforward, no BS, and you're really good at what you do!July, 2019Hi Michael, we attended your seminar a few years ago. Not a month goes by when we don't haul out your big book and look up the answer to a question.July, 2019Thank you for everything you do.

I have become a dedicated reader of your books and blogs and have recently purchased the Profitable Estimating online class which is excellent as well.I worked for my father's home building company for a few years and just recently my wife and I branched off to start our own remodeling and home design company.

You are both truly a blessing and I tell as many contractors as I can about you guys!October, 2018Thank you for the great newsletter this week.

Great pointers, thanks so much!!!October, 2018I have been working in residential alterations and renovations 15yrs. I am starting a contracting framing and siding business of my own and love what Micheal has to offer for business management training.

I have an MBA and we literally spent years learning to dissect financial statements, but they didn't teach us how to use those numbers to run a profitable business . . . The basics presented in your book are applicable to any business. I especially appreciate the time dedicated to \"wrong math\" and why it's wrong. That's very helpful.August, 2018I've thoroughly enjoyed your site and education.August, 2018Hello, I have purchased almost all of you online classes including your proposal estimator and I am having great success with everything.August, 2018Michael advised me when I was having a difficult client. He has a great knack for understanding where people stand and I think he has helped many honest contractors go from losing money to having a decent life. I think the biggest change I was able to make was to not be focused on price. To be focused on professional service and professional work. People will pay for that.May, 2018I really just wanted to say thank you. I would say that 90% of my business has been structured and based off of the advise in your books and I am now fully employed by my company and I no longer work for any outside employers.

I also just bought the proposal writer and it works great!April, 2018I just wanted to say thanks for all you do. I've read both your books and taken a seminar and one online class. I also look forward to your newsletters ‚Äì there's always something for me to learn. I'm not a native to the construction industry. I didn't grow up in the trades, so starting a handyman & light remodeling business has been a long journey for me. I'm still putting one foot in front of the other, but the things I've learned from you have helped me avoid many pitfalls. Thank you so much!April, 2018I read every one of your newsletters that come across my email. I believe yours is the only one I can say that for!March, 2018Thank you so much for this relevant information!!

Thank you again for the wonderful information.March, 2018I am really getting energized about making my business profitable. Thank you for the inspiration and motivation (i.e., boot gently applied to behind).March, 2018This is the only newsletter that I actually read when it hits my inbox - I have unsubscribed from all the others. Each article that Michael Stone writes is a pleasure to read.

We have a LOT of work to do, but we are excited we finally have a direction and plan to follow.November, 2017I recently finished the online Mark-up and Profit class and learned so much; we know we are not charging enough!November, 2017As the saying goes \"if I knew then what I know now\" I would have read both books and attended this most valuable training class 11 years ago before I started my business. This training should be taught in college for anyone considering a career in construction. Thank you both for sharing your experiences, knowledge and truly helping the little guy.October, 2017We want you to know how blessed we have already been by your 2 day class. Although it felt like we got punched right in the gut, it was exactly what we needed to head into the right direction.October, 2017Just a quick note to sincerely THANK YOU once again for sharing with me and all your wisdom. An eye opening and game changer for sure. As you know, this is a tough business in which emotions, fears (when pricing) and a bunch of this come into play. Your 2 day course covers all necessary angles to do an x ray on current business practices and company as a whole.October, 2017Your books and advice columns have helped us transform our business. We are now more specialized and have systems in place that weren't previously there. We charge a fair amount for our work and have been able to put ourselves on payroll for the first time, ever . . . It's glorious, with so much less stress to run the business when we follow your tenets for success!October, 2017If I hadn't came across your website 6 years ago I would have scrapped the idea of running my own construction business entirely. I knew that you were onto exactly what I needed to hear when I first started reading your website. Thank you for being the light at the end of the tunnel for me.October, 2017I am thoroughly enjoying and learning a great deal from your online estimating seminar and I'm only half way through it.July, 2017We have found your website and your resources to be a wealth of information to us.

I am getting more serious about my business and providing quality work that I want to do rather than bend to the customers budget. For years I have taken on whatever work that came my way and priced according to what the client wanted to pay. Then, while doing the job I would be working away taking way too long because of my picky nature.I would end up doing a beautiful job that they didn't pay for and hurting my self financially but most importantly mentally and emotionally.

The results are predictable - debt and a non paying job. I am convinced that our small business will turn around now!On behalf of my husband, son, and I, thank you so very much!

Thank you.September, 2014Recently there was a tiny mix up with a book I ordered. I really appreciated how it was handled. We all make mistakes, this was a small one.

Thanks!August, 2014Thank you Mr. Stone. I have bought these books several times over and can't keep them in stock. I am buying two of each this time so I can hopefully keep a copy for myself.

I am still implementing my procedures and have many steps still to take up the mountain, but it's going the right way.August, 2014Thanks again Michael and Devon!

The future looks great thanks to you. Thank you.July, 2014I gave away my first copy of your book to my brother-in-law who's been contracting for 20 years.
