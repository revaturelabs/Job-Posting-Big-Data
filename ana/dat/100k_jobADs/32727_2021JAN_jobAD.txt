This type of equipment allows divers to work underwater for long periods, go deeper than a snorkel allows and have greater mobility than if they were tethered to an air line. As commercial divers, they perform a variety of tasks for employers in various industries. Job descriptions vary, but certain elements are common.What They DoDivers are typically hired to perform inspections, repairs and installations of building components or equipment. They may secure samples for testing, take photographs or place explosives. For example, divers may inspect bridge pilings or even install portions of the piling structure. Some divers specialize in inspecting dams or underwater pipelines. Divers in shipyards may repair or inspect the areas of the vessel that lie below the waterline. Underwater salvage operators employ divers to help locate and recover items from sea or lake bottoms. Some commercial divers specialize in training other divers, including those interested in learning as a sport or hobby.Desirable AttributesCommercial divers must be safety-oriented. They must be willing and able to keep all equipment in usable condition, make any needed repairs and inspect all items prior to diving. The job can involve underwater welding or mechanical repairs, so divers need to have good manual dexterity and coordination. Divers must remain vigilant at all times and keep a careful eye on their equipment’s dials and gauges, as well as their surroundings. They need the ability to recognize when something might go wrong before it is too late for corrective action. Divers must manage their time carefully to ensure that they have sufficient air in their tanks to make a controlled ascent to the surface.Training and EducationMost commercial divers learn at private dive schools, earning certificates attesting to their level of skills. Few employers are willing to train divers, preferring candidates who have formal training and diving experience. The industry is self-regulated, and various groups, including the Professional Association of Diving Instructors and Scuba Schools International, offer certification to divers at all levels. Certification is performance-based, meaning students must master the necessary skills before moving on to the next level. How quickly students complete training depends on their prowess, how frequently they can attend lessons and how quickly they can master the instructional materials.Pay and Job OutlookFactors such as employer and location affect pay for divers. In May 2012, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that commercial divers earned a median annual wage of $46,880. The best-paid 10 percent earned $93,910 or more, but the lowest-paid 10 percent earned no more than $30,110 a year. Most divers worked for civil engineering and heavy construction companies, earning an average of $60,250 annually, but the highest salaries were for those conducting water transportation support, where they averaged $69,160 per year. O*Net Online predicted job growth between 2010 and 2020 would be about average, projecting about 1,300 new jobs during that time.ReferencesCareerOneStop: Occupation Profile – Commercial DiversO*Net Online: Summary Report for Commercial DiversBureau of Labor Statistics: Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2012 – Commercial DiversBureau of Labor Statistics: The Editor’s Desk – Commercial DiversPADI: Scuba Certification FAQWriter BioJeffrey Joyner has had numerous articles published on the Internet covering a wide range of topics.
