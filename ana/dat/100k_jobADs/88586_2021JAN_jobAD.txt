It’s something that not only bloggers face, but anyone who has a side-hustler or entrepreneurial dream. How do you find a balance between the two, how do you sustain high levels of professionalism and success in both? Let me tell you how I do it.If you didn’t know, I do have a full-time job. In the day-time, I’m chained to an office 9-5 coordinating, scheduling and creating social media content, and anytime after that, I’m creating, researching, shooting content and promoting this blog. Is it hard? Yes. Do I get it done, hell yeah! The key to getting it all done is having a goal and wanting to see it through and having the proper plans in place to achieve your goal.One of the goals that I have for SSM is to publish 2-3 articles a week. That’s no easy feat having a full-time job, but it’s doable. Having a consistent content calendar in place is essential, especially if you have a full-time job. I know this is insane, but I have skeleton blogs & blog ideas lined up for the remainder of the year. I write most of my blogs a week to two weeks, even more in advance, in order to never miss a deadline. I write all of my blogs in the evenings or on the weekends.We love to throw the phrase around, ” I don’t have time”, but truth be told we have more free time than we actually think we do. If you have a lunch hour, turn it into a working lunch. Take the time to write out blog ideas, depending on where you work, take 15 mins to shoot some content. Knock out a few interviews, do some research. Limit your social media activity. We say we don’t have time, but how often do we get caught up in the social media rapture? I know that everyone’s obligations are different if you’re a mom, then obviously your time will be limited. If you have a highly stressful job, then it will also be harder, but not entirely impossible.Having goals are essential but proper planning and execution will ensure you smash your goals out of the park if you find yourself in the act of balancing a full-time job and a blog or any entrepreneurial hustle.I think this will be a regular addition to the blog. I get so many questions, and I’m sure while they are asked privately, they can benefit a wider audience! So, if you have any questions, please email, dm, leave a comment or hit me up on any of the social media channels!PinTweetShare5Email5 SharesTotal0SharesShare 0Tweet 0Pin it 0For emails you'll love!For giveaways, exclusives, tips and more, sign up today.SubscribeBy checking this box, you confirm that you have read and are agreeing to our terms of use regarding the storage of the data submitted through this form.You May Also Like	Read MoreLifestyleHappy New Year!January 3, 2021shesomajorRead MoreLifestyleFinally (kinda) Launched My Business During A World-Wide Pandemic!September 11, 2020shesomajorRead MoreLifestyleAnother Trip Around The Sun 🎉🎈August 11, 2020shesomajorRead MoreLifestyleWhen Life Gives You Lemons, Squeeze That B*sh! 🍋July 26, 2020shesomajorRead MoreLifestyleA Letter To Mom’s Everywhere 💕May 10, 2020shesomajorRead MoreLifestyleA Letter From The EditorMay 5, 2020shesomajorRead MoreLifestyleStay At Home Date Night Ideas For Couples Who Aren’t Sick Of Each OtherMay 4, 2020shesomajorRead MoreLifestyle10 Netflix Shows To Binge ASAPMay 3, 2020shesomajorLeave a Reply	Cancel replyAlways TrendingHow To Start A Blog In 20209 minute readRead More{The Balancing Act} Managing A Full-time Job + A Blog2 minute readRead MoreThe Keys To Staying Consistent3 minute readRead MoreSuper Facts: The Truth About Travel Blogging6 minute readRead MoreRead Next1A Cheap Flight Is Not Worth The Risk 🤦🏾‍♀️2 minute read2Sorry, But I’m Reclining My Airplane Seat2 minute read38 Travel Apps You Need In 20203 minute read4Walking With Lions In South Africa2 minute read524 Hours In Florence4 minute readWhere I ShopJ.CrewSteve MaddenZaraNordstromMacy'sForever 21TargetSephoraAldoHi Rakuten: How To Make Money While You Shop5 minute readRead MoreFor emails you'll love.For giveaways, exclusives, tips and more, sign up today.SubscribeBy checking this box, you confirm that you have read and are agreeing to our terms of use regarding the storage of the data submitted through this form.Copyright © 2009-2020 SHESOMAJOR.
