Our goal is to bring English education in Japan to a new level, with high results gained from a conversation and culturally driven curriculum. Our instructors are encouraged to provide students with fun & creative classes that focus on real-life conversational skills - we believe when students are having fun, they are more engaged; and when instructors are having fun, they provide the best possible lessons!The native English instructor is the centerpiece of a WinBe school. WinBe instructors work with their school's Japanese staff, head office staff, and other WinBe instructors to assess the needs of their students and provide them with the best possible lessons. Most WinBe students are children ages 3-14, but instructors may be asked to teach both children and adults. Classes emphasize practical language, and instructors conduct their classes completely in English. While WinBe has a set curriculum, instructors use their creativity to prepare fun and interesting classes that best suit their students; this allows ample creative freedom to inject passion and enthusiasm into your class.We would like our instructors to see themselves as the representatives of their respective countries and act accordingly in a fun and professional manner at all times. An instructor's perspective: \"Working for WinBe is about achieving your full potential as a constructive and creative instructor.\"For more details, please visit our homepage via our Company Profile above.*While we sincerely appreciate all applications, only those candidates selected for interview will be contacted. *The above information is a public job ad.
