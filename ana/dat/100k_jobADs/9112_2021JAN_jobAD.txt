"No Mandate, Just a Job to Do - The Feehery Theory The Feehery TheoryThe Feehery TheoryAboutSpeakingArchivesContactJohn Feehery: Speaking EngagementsNo Mandate, Just a Job to DoPosted on November 7, 2012In Presidential re-elections, the incumbent usually gets more votes than he did the first time, unless of course he loses.Bush got more votes against Kerry than he did against Gore.Clinton got more votes against Dole than he did against Bush.Reagan got more votes against Mondale than he did against Carter.Nixon got more votes against McGovern than he did against Humphrey.It is rather unusual for a President to be less popular than when first elected, but still win the election.The American people usually say to an incumbent President: thumbs up or thumbs down. They don’t say thumbs down, but thumbs up against the other guy.Barack Obama lost votes and support from his first run. And he barely just won the popular vote for President. There are a lot of disillusioned voters out there who either turned away from this President or voted with him with a grave sense of disillusionment.And yet, Mr. Obama was able to squeak by to re-election.Does he have a mandate?I don’t even know what that means. I do know that he has the keys to front door of the White House and that he has the pen with which to sign or veto legislation coming from Capitol Hill. He also has the codes to our nuclear weapons.Mandate is all in the beholder.He can mandate all he wants, but if he can’t get the Congress to cooperate, that point is moot.Some of my progressive friends think that Obama is a moderate and that he is ready to sell them out at a moment’s notice. I find that hard to believe, although I wish it were so.Obama acts like a typical left-winger, in my book. He wants to raise taxes on the rich so that he can expand the power and size of the government. That is not what centrists do. That is not what Bill Clinton said that he wanted to do, when he said that the era of big government is over.But to the new Democrats coming into the Senate, I betcha Obama looks like a centrist. Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin are going to be Harry Reid’s own private nightmare as he tries to negotiate deals on taxes and spending.Warren and Baldwin, along with Barbara Boxer, Al Franken and Bernie Sanders, will see to it that Obama doesn’t cut any deal on anything. That is the role traditionally taken up by Nancy Pelosi, but since Pelosi is in the House and doesn’t have any power (or than her considerable power of personal persuasion) and since she is probably going to quit any way, I see Warren and Baldwin becoming the extremely liberal sisters of the status quo.By status quo, I mean that they don’t want any changes in our entitlement programs. No progress. No reform. No savings. NothingAnd since John Boehner would be a fool to budge on taxes until Obama budges on the entitlements that are putting this country into bankruptcy, that means that we won’t be getting any Grand Bargains in the next Congress without considerable pain inflicted on Harry Reid.My solution? Do it now, before the Status Quo sisters get sworn into Congress. Get it done in the lame duck.Obama doesn’t have a mandate. He only has a job to do. And he better do it quickly.<<PrevNext>>Browse by MonthJanuary 2021December 2020November 2020October 2020September 2020August 2020July 2020June 2020May 2020April 2020March 2020February 2020January 2020December 2019November 2019October 2019September 2019August 2019July 2019June 2019May 2019April 2019March 2019February 2019January 2019December 2018November 2018October 2018September 2018August 2018July 2018June 2018May 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017October 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016November 2016October 2016September 2016August 2016July 2016June 2016May 2016April 2016March 2016February 2016January 2016December 2015November 2015October 2015September 2015August 2015July 2015June 2015May 2015April 2015March 2015February 2015January 2015December 2014November 2014October 2014September 2014August 2014July 2014June 2014May 2014April 2014March 2014February 2014January 2014December 2013November 2013October 2013September 2013August 2013July 2013June 2013May 2013April 2013March 2013February 2013January 2013December 2012November 2012October 2012September 2012August 2012July 2012June 2012May 2012April 2012March 2012February 2012January 2012December 2011November 2011October 2011September 2011August 2011July 2011June 2011May 2011April 2011March 2011February 2011January 2011December 2010November 2010October 2010September 2010August 2010July 2010June 2010May 2010April 2010March 2010February 2010January 2010December 2009November 2009October 2009September 2009August 2009July 2009June 2009May 2009April 2009March 2009February 2009January 2009December 2008November 2008October 2008September 2008August 2008July 2008June 2008May 2008<<PrevNext>>©2021 The Feehery TheoryAboutSpeakingARCHIVEContact"
