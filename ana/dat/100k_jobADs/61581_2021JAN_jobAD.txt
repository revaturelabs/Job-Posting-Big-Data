Interacting with the app not only helps him achieve his health and fitness objectives, it also influences his role as manager of FordPass Solutions for North America.“I’m very cognizant of how different apps work, even if they are not automotive-related, and I use my own experiences as a consumer to enhance our FordPass app,” he says.FordPass is a mobility experience platform that reimagines the relationship between Ford and the consumer by offering benefits that include mobility services and rewards for membership loyalty.\"WE WANT TO MAKE FORD THE MOST TRUSTED MOBILITY COMPANY IN THE WORLD BY OFFERING SERVICES THAT MAKE PEOPLE’S LIVES EASIER.\"Jeff ReidFordPass Solutions Manager, North AmericaJeff leads the effort to develop subscription packages for FordPass customers in North America.“I can’t say exactly what I’m working on because it’s proprietary, but the services we are looking at will be beneficial to the customer at a great value,” he explains.Jeff has a passion for the customer experience, and it has served him well throughout his career at Ford. Prior to his role with FordPass Solutions, he worked as a product marketing manager for Ford and Lincoln vehicles. Most recently, he led the national advertising strategy for Ford trucks and connected cars.“I’ve had the opportunity to launch vehicles as well as work on future products, and all of the experience I’ve gained has helped me become a better all-around marketer,” he says.Jeff received his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering before changing course to earn an MBA in marketing. He says the automotive industry is a natural fit for both interests, especially now as he works on a technology-related facet of the business.“My engineering education helps me understand some of the technical issues that come up with FordPass, and it also enables me to communicate more effectively with the technical team,” he says.For Jeff, FordPass provides an exciting challenge.“I’m working on technology that’s new to Ford and can provide a benefit to our customers,” he says. “We want to make Ford the most trusted mobility company in the world by offering services that make people’s lives easier – on top of selling them a vehicle.”Discover MoreView jobsBack to the topCalifornia ResidentsExercise your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act here.Do Not Sell My Personal InformationFord PressMediaContact UsFord Motor Company InvestorsSupportFord Support US Lincoln Support US Recalls FordPassShopFord US Lincoln US Global SitesFord PressMediaContact UsFord Motor Company InvestorsSupportFord Support US Lincoln Support US Recalls FordPassShopFord US Lincoln US Global SitesShare your thoughts about corporate.ford.comConnect with us© 2020 Ford Motor CompanyAccessibilityPrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsYour CA Privacy RightsTerms and ConditionsOpen Source NoticesFord Social Rules of the RoadSSN Privacy (view pdf)Global Modern Slavery Disclosure (view pdf)Conflict Minerals (view pdf)Pay Transparency (view pdf)"
