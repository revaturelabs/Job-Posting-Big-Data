If I’m not chasing my five kids, I’m writing fiction or music, the two best jobbies in the world. I also love to laugh, play the piano, and snuggle up with a good book (though not at the same time).What is a jobby, you might ask?My husband likes to tease me. No. My husband loves to tease me, especially about writing. This whole writing thing came out of the blue for me, and even though it’s been nearly six years, he’s still struggling to catch up.This summer, he was talking to some friends about my books, music, blog, and the likes. They got in a discussion about whether this was my job or my hobby. One of them, who will remain unnamed to protect their identity, coined the lovely phrase:It’s her jobby.I have to admit, I snarled a little when I heard this, cat claws and all.But…*cringe*It’s kind of growing on me.Jobby.I’m a stay-at-home mom of five kids. That means I’m on call ALL THE TIME. Sick kid? I’m there. Forgotten lunch? Drop everything to save the day. Dentist appointments, track meets? No problem. Chipped fingernail? Okay, I’m being a little silly, but I truly love being a stay-at-home mom. I never want another job. Ever. And I love that my hubby supports me staying at home with our five little rugrats.This whole writing/composing thing is something I do in my free time.I liken it to firemen who sit in their fire stations playing Ping-Pong until the alarm sounds. Then they drop their paddles and run.Writing and composing are my Ping-Pong.The difference is, I get paid to write and compose, and I bust my tail to make both professional. I research, I study, I read up on both areas to become the best author/composer I can be. So in that way, they’re jobs.However, if you were to stop me in the street and ask, “Do you work?” I’d say, “No.” (While in the back of my mind, I’d think, I’m a full-time mom. What kind of question is that? Do I work? Grumble, grumble, grumble.) But I would swallow the snarkiness, because I know what people really mean is, “Do you work outside the home? Do you have an employer? Does someone pay you for your blood, sweat, and tears?”As a full-time mom, the answer is “No.”As an author and composer, the answer is, “Yes.”See how I’m caught in the middle?That’s why this whole “JOBBY” thing is growing on me.To me, a hobby is something you’d do for free. You do it because you love it. You do it because you can’t stand to NOT do it. You do it instead of watching TV, talking on the phone, bathing, eating, etc.But a job is something you’re paid to do. Which, I am.So I’ve changed my quick bio to read: When I’m not chasing my five kids, I’m writing fiction or music, the two best jobbies in the world. That way people know:1) I’m a mom first. The deadlines can wait. The research can wait. Everything can wait if that alarm sounds and someone needs me2) I love creating fiction and music. I mean, I live, breathe, and eat it. And I will make everything as professional and high-quality as I am capableDoes that make sense? Writing and music are my jobbies.If you throw in a picture of my kids and hubby, this sums up who I amMan, I hate it when my hubby’s right. Doesn’t happen often. :)(Please don’t tell him or his friends about this post. Seriously. I’ll never live it down. As in, never ever.)(Ev-er!).What do you guys think? Job or hobby? Or both? Do you have anything like this in your life? How do you describe it?Share:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...Related10/18/13 08/22/15 Music	Published by Rebecca BellistonView all posts by Rebecca Belliston	8 thoughts on “My Jobbies: Juggling a life of Writing, Composing, and Mothering”	Charissa says:	10/18/13 at 11:50 amI love that word. Jobby is the perfect description for a mother-writer.LikeLikeReplyRebecca Belliston says:	10/18/13 at 3:15 pmHaha. I agree now. I’m not sure why it made me so ticked before. :)LikeLikeReplyJulie Casey says:	10/18/13 at 12:32 pmYep, that word fits. I have lots of jobbies, but only one real job that matters most: being a stay-at-home, homeschooling mom. Thanks for the great post, Rebecca, and the new word to describe what I do in my spare time.LikeLikeReplyRebecca Belliston says:	10/18/13 at 3:16 pm:) I admire you for the home-school thing. I know you must do a great job at it, too. I think I might overdo this JOBBY word. I can see myself using it all the time (when my hubby’s not around, of course). :)LikeLikeReplyAnne Burns says:	10/19/13 at 12:09 pmIt’s a fabulous description! I write resumes, but it’s only after our five home schoolers are fast asleep that I make any money. And it’s not like we could eat from what I make because it turns out that I, too, need sleep. It’s just my jobby. ;-)LikeLikeReplyRebecca Belliston says:	10/19/13 at 1:40 pmExactly! I think I’m going to end up using this word more and more. I’ll just have to explain it to people, though. :)LikeLikeReplyAnonymous says:	10/23/13 at 6:08 pmI have plenty of hobbies and I love this idea of a jobby. I don’t have any jobbies. No one would pay me for my hobbies. I think it is a jobby. Great word!LikeLikeReplyRebecca Belliston says:	10/23/13 at 6:50 pm:) I love the word, too!LikeLikeReplyWhat do you think?
