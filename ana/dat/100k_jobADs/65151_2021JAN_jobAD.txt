For those people with a disability looking for jobs, there are numerous resources giving attention to the field, the requirements and the potential. Jobs for people with disabilities is a hot topic, and here are six tips to focus on that should lead to job placement.1) Know The Americans With Disabilities \"Amendment Act\"The first section of the act deals with private employers as well as state and local governments, employment agencies and labor unions. The act prohibits discrimination due to disability whether or not they have been offered reasonable accommodations to perform the job task. In 2008, the additions to this amendment assured individuals that the disability definition will now be construed as broad coverage to the maximum extent, and would discourage undue extensive analysis that might slow or block employment placements. Call on this act when needed. http://www.usmilitary.about.com/od/jobopportunities/a/disabledvet.htm2) Become Familiar with US Dept. of Veterans Affairs Employment Training and Placement programsJob specific and related training is available here. Employers can design specific training programs for potential disabled employees when needed. Bring with you to your interview information and facts about the benefits provided to employers who do hire disabled veterans. Let your potential employer know what they will gain by hiring you. Many informational brochures are available that can help you to assemble talking points for during your interview.3) Use Dept. of Labor's Veterans Training ServiceThis organization supports a vast network of local employment professionals to locate and secure jobs for disabled veterans. These professionals provide employers with qualified employees, thereby securing jobs for people with a disability. This outreach on behalf of finding careers for the disabled is highly effective, and is a great service to the employers as well. Making contact personally, and selling your skills into these networks is very effective. Get the contact list of organizations from their website and find your own ways to do outreach.4) Understand the Rehabilitation ActThis legislation assures that no discrimination around jobs for people with disabilities will take place in any program run by federal agencies, agencies receiving federal funds, or by contractors hiring on behalf of federal government. Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act mandates government contractors, making them take affirmative action and hire people with disabilities. Section 510 of this act ensures affirmative actions as well as non-discrimination by any federal agencies including agencies within the executive branch of government.5) Participate in Disability Mentoring DayThis program connects students and job seekers with disabilities with thousands of employees every year. It takes place in 200 locations across the nation, usually held on the third Wednesday in October. Take cues from programs like these to find your own ways to establish internships and job shadowing opportunities that can and do lead to long-term jobs for people with a disability.6) Educate Potential EmployersEvery year thousands of brave military personnel become disabled and are released into the active pool of veterans looking for work. Overall, there are millions representing this very rich pool of employee talent. Their abilities have been more than proven. Their training is intense and specific. Their loyalty is unquestionable. Their work history is transparent and the ultimate sacrifice has already been made.View the discussion thread.Latest JobsDiversity JobsAbout Our PartnersLooking for applicants with disabilities, including veterans?
