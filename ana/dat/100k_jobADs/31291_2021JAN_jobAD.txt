DescriptionLocationSearch#BarchesterTogether Staff Support VideoPosted on May 14, 2020 by admin	Here at Barchester, we have produced a video message for all of our staff members, to help them to cope with some of the stress or anxiety associated with COVID-19.It is an uncertain time for all of us but we hope that this video will help to acknowledge how much we care about our staff whilst also offering some practical guidance. The video is only 4 minutes long but aims to help staff to realise they are not alone and hopefully it will also emphasise that social care staff are also very much recognised as front line workers.Remember, we are all in this together.#BarchesterTogetherThis entry was posted in News.
