February 2010 14:08 by Jobo | 5 CommentsTweetYesterday evening, February 8 2010, in her very own kitchen just before supper - The Double Pointed Needler officially succumbed to fatal sock-inflicted injuries.Carefully crafted from Knit Picks Illusion yarn, the weapons were soft but swift. These alpaca babies were definitely not skittish about meeting strangers. They leapt from the carefully addressed and delivered yellow envelope and quickly and permanently wrapped themselves around the victim's feet.The Needler is reported to have slouched in her chair immediately - out of pure handmade sock pleasure. Also, added to the tragic package to soften the beastly blow were 2 beautiful bars of Ghirardelli chocolate (one with dark chocolate and caramel, the other milk) and a tube of Burt's Bees Honey lip balm. A kind note accompanied the assassin's sockly treasure offering condolences - but no apologies - for socks well knitted and games well played.When contacted for comments, the Needler's Husband refused to speak with our reporters, but admitted his sadness and sense of loss over the whole fiasco. Though he thinks perhaps now that there are no further rounds of insane sock assassination missions, perhaps his wife might be able to finish his afghan, which has been in progress for far longer than any pair of socks he has ever seen.From the grave, The Double Pointed Needler sends out a very heartfelt Thank-you to both Dore and DevilSticks for their excellent sock grenades which fit perfectly, are a lovely color, and will be worn many many times :)Categories: General , Knitting | Tags: sock wars v, socks, dead!, don't box me in, knitpicks, illusions, alpaca, swag, chocolate, lip balm, prizes, wonderful, dore, devilsticks | PermalinkSearchTag cloud198 yds of heaven2-ply3 ply3-plyacrylicafterthought heelairyall for love of yarnalpacaangoraaraucaniababybamboobarking dog yarnsbattbattsbeadsbeautifulbelfast mini millsRecentCommentsStill Here!
