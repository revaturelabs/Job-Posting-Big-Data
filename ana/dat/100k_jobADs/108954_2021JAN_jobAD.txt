That is, you need to sit down and clearly define the roles and responsibilities of a job by writing a job description.A good customer service job description—one that will get you qualified matches—accomplishes the following:Describes what the job entailsLays out the job’s responsibilities and tasksOutlines the basic skills a candidate needsGives hiring managers the chance to lay out the “intangibles” for successThis sometimes-overlooked or rushed step in the hiring process is crucial: A recent report conducted by the Talent Board found that job descriptions are the most important job-related content that candidates look for when researching a job.A well-written job description also saves managers time in the screening and interviewing stages. By defining a role’s responsibilities, you decrease the number of candidates that aren’t qualified and attract more of the candidates that are. Sitting down to write a job description also helps managers set goals for role, and envision the ideal applicant’s skills.Where to start with a job descriptionWriting a customer service job description is daunting, but it doesn’t have to be. After all, making one bad hire can cost both your team and your company money, time and effort. To ensure that you write a description that attracts candidates who will fit your culture and achieve your team’s goals, take your time.To start, gather any previous hiring paperwork you might have, or ask other managers who have filled open positions recently for their descriptions. You may find that it’s faster to edit components of a job description than to write totally new sections.Consider the tone of your posting, as well. Not every post for a job should be the same, but all posts across the company should fit your brand. For example, if your company is laid back and strives to create a “work hard, play hard” company culture, your post shouldn’t be stiff and formal. Similarly, if your company is looking for serious individuals, it’s best not to use customer service team names like “guru,” “ninja” and “wizard” because that could turn potential candidates off.When in doubt, aim to be concise, direct and enticing.Brainstorming and developing a listingThe first part of a description is usually a list of the job duties a candidate will be expected to perform. These points should address:Day-to-day tasksMethods used to perform these responsibilitiesGoals a candidate will be expected to achieveExpectations for how the individual would work with other departmentsThe managerial role this person will have and who they will overseeThen outline the minimum technical and personality skills an applicant should have to fill this role (which you can screen for with great interview questions).Here are some areas you should think on for finding those skills:What knowledge must they haveWhat software programs they must knowWhat other skills are essential to succeedingWhat do you wish a candidate could doOnce you’ve got a full list of skills and traits you’d like to see in an applicant, sort them into three columns: “Job Requirements,” “Must-Have Skills” and “Bonus Skills” (those that aren’t essential to the job, but could present opportunities to learn and grow in the role).Use a comprehensive job description to find the perfect hire.Click To TweetThe keys to writing a standout job descriptionWhen you’re ready to finish your post, ensure that you’ve got all the elements in place.
