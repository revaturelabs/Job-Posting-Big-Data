Responsible for the strategic direction and architecture of all marketing efforts, and 100% focused on the revenue impact of all marketing activity, this leadership role is the antithesis of John Wanamaker’s marketing maxim “half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.”There is a full job description at the bottom of the page, which is important as research continues to confirm that the riskiest and most short-lived job of the C-suite is the chief marketing officer (CMO). One study from Korn Ferry estimates that the average tenure of a CMO is a mere 4.1 years—half of the average tenure of a CEO and less than the CFO, CIO and chief HR officer.1 A separate study from Spencer Stuart found that the average CMO tenure among consumer brands has been on a declining trend for the last two years.2What’s the problem? Put simply: The role of today’s CMO is changing. What used to be a straightforward position focused on right-brain skills and campaign execution is evolving into a more complicated role that requires a diverse mix of creativity, financial literacy, technical acumen, and strategic vision.And while this blend of skills can be challenging to find, it is not impossible. In fact, it is critical in today’s competitive landscape. Knowing what to look for in a CMO is imperative for companies that want to drive organizational change, reach new customers, and increase revenue.As the late Stephen Covey stated in his well-known book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, success starts with having the end in mind. If the goal is to turn marketing activities into revenue generators, then it is critical to find a leader that is focused on the same end goal and, more importantly, has the skills to achieve that goal.The following is a list of seven “habits” to look for in an effective, revenue-driven CMO, as well a sample job description to aid companies in their search.Strategic view of demand. For years, CMOs have been laser-focused on visual brand identity and execution of campaigns, but more is needed from a CMO today. Revenue-driven CMOs think beyond brand. They have a long-term, strategic view of demand, and they understand that a singular marketing push doesn’t reliably and consistently fill the pipeline. Their focus is generating demand that is perpetual, sustainable, and dictated by the dynamic needs of the buyer.Outcome orientated. CMOs often obsess about marketing ROI; however, they focus on activities and their costs, not on demand and revenue. Getting to ROI requires being responsible not only for marketing investment, but also for the overall return. CMOs need to care about demand outcomes — revenue. Their goal should not be to simply distribute brand messaging. Instead, they need to ensure that marketing has a measurable contribution to the pipeline and sales.Analyzes numbers, doesn’t just report them. This is perhaps one of the biggest shifts in the CMO role. Today’s marketing leaders need to be able to report on more than web traffic, downloads and clicks. Marketing engagement needs to be tied to revenue results, and effective revenue-driven CMOs are strategic planners with financial acumen, able to communicate pipeline and revenue impact to sales, operations, and planning teams. Marketing is no longer simply about the media leveraged. Instead, it should be about running quantitative numbers against every marketing channel and analyzing what those numbers mean.Focuses on optimization and execution. A revenue-driven CMO should be concerned with optimizing his or her marketing investment and the outcome of it, not just executing a plan. CMOs should be regularly monitoring the different dimensions of the companies’ strategy and be able to make adjustments geared towards revenue growth. This includes continual optimization of all four elements of demand marketing—people, process, content, and technology.Thinks about marketing in terms of perpetual engagement with customers, not campaigning to prospects. Too many CMOs continue to market “inside out,” clinging to the “push” of product and company information via interruptive tactics. Research continues to show that this type of marketing approach often fails because messages are in the wrong place at the wrong time. For example, in one survey from Accenture Interactive, CMOs reported that of all the individuals they reach with their marketing messages, “fewer than 18 percent are actually in the market for the product or service on offer.”3 In order to be successful, revenue-driven CMOs must shift their fundamental approach to marketing to better align with the customer’s lifecycle. This includes building a marketing engine that constantly engages, nurtures, and converts buyers on the timeframe that is right for the buyer.Defines brand in terms of customer relationship, not visual identity. A revenue-driven CMO should view brand as a dialogue between the buyer and the company providing a product or services. Instead of simply thinking about brand in terms of recognizable visual identity, today’s CMO should think about customer lifetime value, and how to build a better customer relationship with both new and existing customers. According to a report from Forrester, “a new reality is setting in where CMOs must manage brands holistically, ensuring consistency between brand promise and the experience delivered.”4 It is no longer enough for a CMO to ensure that a potential buyer recognizes a company name or promise. Today’s revenue-driven CMO is in charge of delivering that message to buyers and then ensuring that those buyers turn into (and remain) happy, loyal customers.Strives to be the chief customer experience officer. According to a recent Deloitte study, “being the voice of the customer at the leadership table” was ranked as the most important role for an effective CMO.5 In another CMO survey from IBM, two-thirds of respondents regard developing deeper, richer customer experiences as their top marketing priority.6 The message is clear: Revenue-driven CMOs can’t just focus on the promotional side of business if they want to build customer lifetime value. Instead, they need to advocate for the buyer and be committed to enhancing and improving their experience in order to drive revenue. This means that marketing leaders must be the voice inside the company that re-orients and constantly re-invigorates the company’s processes and systems around the customer.Sample Revenue-Driven CMO Job DescriptionPosition Overview:The revenue-driven CMO is the “hub” of brand, product marketing and demand marketing activity at YOUR_COMPANY_NAME.
