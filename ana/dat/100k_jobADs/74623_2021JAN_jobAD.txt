Emergency Departments, Surgery, Medical Intensive Care Unit and Surgical Intensive Care Units cannot accommodate students under the age of Eighteen (18) unless approved by the Vice President/Chief Nursing Officer and Department Director. There is NO shadowing in the Women’s center (Labor & Delivery, Mother/Baby, NICU) due to it being a safety-sensitive area.Job Shadow opportunities are suspended during peak flu season, November through March annually, and may be subject to cancellation or change at the last minute, due to unforeseen circumstances.
