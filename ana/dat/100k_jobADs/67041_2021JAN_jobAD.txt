It has a beautiful, gold color, and a composition that gives it its high biocompatibility and affinity to skin. Extracted from cold-pressed jojoba nuts, it contains cetyl palmitate, squalene, higher alcohols, fatty acids, and vitamins. It's easily absorbed without leaving a greasy film. Jojoba wax nourishes, moisturizes, oils, and softens both skin and hair, protecting them from harsh weather conditions. Recommended for baby skin care.Salt of BochniaMined in Bochnia from the miocene deposits, this iodine-bromine medicinal salt is used to treat a variety of ailments through baths, inhalations, compresses etc. Saline baths relax the muscles, help ion exchange, and condition every type of skin, but are especially recommended for atopic and allergy-prone skin. This salt acts as an antiseptic and clears the respiratory tract.Zabłocka SaltThis salt has the highest iodine content in the world. It has a high concentration of iodides: bromine, calcium, magnesium, silicon, selenium, as well as most trace elements. It is obtained through the condensation of saline water extracted near Dębowiec in Southern Poland. Bathing in saline brings great benefits to the entire body, inside and out: skin, internal organs, and the respiratory tract. Zabłocka salt baths are one of the oldest medical and cosmetic treatments. During a bath in warm, salty water, the skin’s pores rapidly expand and open, the muscles relax, and ion exchange can occur. Afterwards, the skin is nourished, moisturized, and cleansed, and its condition is greatly improved. The salt is especially effective at soothing atopic and dry skin.See all ingredientsSodium Chloride, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Domestica (Plum) Seed Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Glycerin (derived from vegetable oil), Parfum, Mica (CI77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Manganese Violet (CI77742), Tin Oxide (CI77861), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol**ingredients of natural essential oils, potential allergensCommentsBe the first to review “NATURAL SCRUB WITH PLUM KERNEL AND JOJOBA OIL” Cancel reply	Your email address will not be published.
