Anonymity protects people a hell of a lot more than public white knights who are so cowardly as to be afraid to name a person renowned for his assholery.1 year ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist295aRight, exactly. The person being named and shamed on econtwitter is small beans compared to the stories on econtwitter that are actually nepotism/abuse of power and where they don't mention the name.1 year ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economistd6e5RWTheir initials have been mentioned.

The US and the UK are notorious for social awckwardness. Very strange to most other people in the West.Actually, I would say that Britain is changing in this respect; young people hug a lot, so do Northerners more generally.1 year ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist0e6cWow, situation in the US seems tense. I have my own theory:1°) no physical contact at all culture (except the fake hugs-I mean, when the need of hugging someone is genuine, you usually hug them tightly, not loosely as it is the case with the fake hugs);2°) people are pressured very young to be successful in schools and hence they do too much \"homework\", which deteriorates creativity (no time to discover other stuff) and make people frustrated.So we end up with frustrated non-creative people, which explains the harassements and the lack of creativity in economic thinking.1 year ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist581bWow, situation in the US seems tense.

Specially about 2) above. Their way of coping with the insane preassure since young ages, is by getting wasted 3-4 times a week after office. You have no clue what a brit really thinks about , and what person he/she is, until (s)he gets wasted and reveals his/her type.1 year ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 0 No Jab !EconomistfbbdVery few powerful men in this world won't abuse their office in one way or the other.My earnest prayers everyday is to be among these very few when the time comes..I will abuse my power by openly playing skyrim in my office1 year ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist2ad0SC is such an annoying white knight on Twitter, ffs1 year ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 2 No Jab !« Previous1…34ReplyPost	I think that those of us who read EJMR a bit had already figured that out...He's talking about Heckman.https://twitter.com/causalinf/status/1083730872111632385 but no names. this is where the anonymity of ejmr helps.Send Post »Markup: a blockquote code em strong ul ol li.Economics Job Market Rumors | Job Market | Conferences | Employers | Journal Submissions | Links | Privacy | Contact | Night ModeDefault Personality Textbook In the Club Rouge Mod Old Krug New Krug Kentucky NuSchool UKAP Sturmy Weather Not Brogues The Real Cambridge Lee Kuan Blue Beethoven Honkers Tokyo Drift Concert Hall Don't Pluck with the Chuck Troll Farm"
