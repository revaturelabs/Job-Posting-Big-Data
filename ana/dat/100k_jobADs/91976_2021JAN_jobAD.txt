Omer Jama Farah, who is also the current director of the Taakulo Somali Community, believes that piracy in his country can be prevented in his country by creating jobs and taking care of orphaned children with the help of countries such as the United Arab Emirates.Mr. Farah was in the UAE to attend a panel composed of public and private sector organizations in Dubai and Abu Dhabi with the aim of eradicating piracy. He believes “The risk of piracy continues and if we create new opportunities for youth and awareness spreads among them, then they will not engage with illegal groups to make ends meet and will not join pirates.”The Taakulo Somali Community provides aid and support to areas plagued by drought, lack of education and poor health care in remote places in Somalia. It is from these areas in particular that pirates are recruited. According to Mr. Farah, “The level of piracy may have reduced but groups are still training, collecting and recruiting young people so we have to take precautions and save these youths. It is very crucial to work with organisations in the UAE to fight piracy with job creation for women and the youth. It is now also vital to reach inaccessible regions to tackle basic issues of severe water shortages.”Attending the panel were 54 representatives of government, non-government and industry from Somalia, Somaliland, Puntland and the UAE. Among the proposals put forward at the meeting were a sponsorship program to pay for 5,000 orphans’ schooling and living expenses, as well as professional training for young people.Mr Farah is convinced that “We must try to make them a part of the community by showing them a better way of life. Job creation for women will also help them generate income and send their children to school. The UAE is already helping with development and emergency aid and we are hoping for more cooperation.”The Emirates already lends support to Somalia in the form of food aid and projects to provide safe drinking water and pledged Dh183 million in May last year to step up security in Somalia, boost political cooperation and give humanitarian aid.The focus of the latest initiative is how Somalis can help themselves by becoming self-reliant. Mohammed Sharaf, the chief executive of DP World, the organizer of the panel, believes that it is important that young Somalis are encouraged to become involved in the development of their own country and establish their own local businesses.Although at sea skirmishes have recently been reported by the maritime authorities, there has been a marked decline in the success of piracy over the past two years. The new government, which was elected and came to power in 2012, promised to end the civil war and inter-clan fighting which ensued after the country’s dictator Siad Barre was deposed in 1991. The most recent unsuccessful attempt to hijack a tanker headed to Fujairah was foiled thanks to the ship’s armed guards, who were able to successfully ward off the pirates.But piracy around the Horn of Africa remains a threat and, according to Mohammed Osman Ahmed, the executive director of the Somaliland Counter Piracy Coordination Office, “Regional stakeholders have to remain vigilant. The piracy business framework in south central Somalia is believed to be intact, according to our intelligence. Piracy motivated by revenge of arrested piracy chiefs may be in the pipeline.” He maintains that “piracy will remain a threat as long as young Somalis have access to arms on the Horn of Africa and have no means to earn their living legally either on sea or land […] but successful hijacking has not happened for two years because of private armed security guards on ships and naval presence.”Related posts:Releases of Somali pirates Raise Big ConcernsFrench General Says Somali Piracy Is OverPiracy: The Face Of A Modern PirateAnti-Piracy: Shipping cuts piracy roots with learning centre Girija ShettarSomali PiracyShare this Post :SearchRecent PostsFirst Tiltable Rotor Sails Installed on SEA-CARGO Ro-Ro by NorsepowerNew Cyprus Green Incentives Programme Introduces Tonnage Tax Reductions of up to 30%Hydroniq Coolers Enters Marine Partnership with SonFlowLeading Supplier of Ship Control Systems Servowatch Acquired by Rolls-RoyceDe Nora Receives New IMO Type Approval for BALPURE Ballast Water Management SystemRecent commentsURL on Plastic Waste: Research Says That Our Plastic Waste Is Harming Sharks and RaysDibalik Mudahnya Hidup dengan Plastik - Sustaination on 10 Worst Oil Spills in World HistoryYassir Colon on 10 Worst Oil Spills in World HistoryJasmine McIntosh on 10 Worst Oil Spills in World HistoryMelanie Glastrong on Enforcement of Emission Reduction Rules Will Start at Major Ports in ChinaArchivesJanuary 2021December 2020November 2020October 2020September 2020August 2020July 2020June 2020May 2020April 2020March 2020February 2020January 2020December 2019November 2019October 2019September 2019August 2019July 2019June 2019May 2019April 2019March 2019February 2019January 2019December 2018November 2018October 2018September 2018August 2018July 2018June 2018May 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017October 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016November 2016October 2016September 2016August 2016July 2016June 2016May 2016April 2016March 2016February 2016December 2015November 2015October 2015September 2015August 2015July 2015June 2015May 2015April 2015March 2015February 2015January 2015December 2014November 2014October 2014September 2014August 2014July 2014June 2014May 2014April 2014March 2014February 2014News deskFirst Tiltable Rotor Sails Installed on SEA-CARGO Ro-Ro by NorsepowerNew Cyprus Green Incentives Programme Introduces Tonnage Tax Reductions of up to 30%Hydroniq Coolers Enters Marine Partnership with SonFlowLeading Supplier of Ship Control Systems Servowatch Acquired by Rolls-RoyceDe Nora Receives New IMO Type Approval for BALPURE Ballast Water Management SystemNews in imagesFirst Tiltable Rotor Sails Installed on SEA-CARGO Ro-Ro by Norsepower20 JanCleaner SeasNew Cyprus Green Incentives Programme Introduces Tonnage Tax Reductions of up to 30%20 JanCleaner SeasHomeArticlesVideosIntroductionStatisticsContent and Social Media Advertising with Cleaner SeasWebsite disclaimerContactPrivacy Policy© 2019 Transeas AssociatesDesigned and built by Ace Web Studio	This website uses cookies to help make it function properly.
