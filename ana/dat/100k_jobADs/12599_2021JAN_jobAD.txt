Yes! Preparation beforehand and solid strategies at the event will lead to interested veteran candidates and career fair success.Send the Right RepresentativesAs the face of your organization, your reps should be personable, outgoing, knowledgeable, and passionate about your company and its opportunities. They should actively work your table and engage job seekers as well as other exhibitors, rather than waiting to be approached. Be prepared to interview candidates on-the-spot.This is also the perfect environment for a representative from a military background. If you don’t have one, at least send someone who is curious about the military experience and can ask questions that draw candidates out and compel them to tell their stories.Maximize Your BrandTell the veteran community who you are by wearing company gear and displaying banners, backdrops, and panels. Identify veteran representatives with name tags or table signs.Identify Your OpportunitiesHaving a list of open positions for which you are recruiting is ideal. Be ready to talk about general roles for which you typically hire. Handouts of open jobs are great takeaways and should include reference numbers in your ATS.Announce Your PresenceDraw more job seekers to your booth by getting the word out that you want to hire veterans and will be at a RecruitMilitary Veteran Career Fair. Tap into your company’s marketing resources and leverage its social networking tools to announce your participation in the event. Spotlight hot jobs in your company on social media during the week of the event and let candidates know you’ll be looking to hire veterans for these roles.Get SocialOne of the best ways to make your presence known as a RecruitMilitary hiring event exhibitor is to help set the stage on social media. Post event information on LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook with links to specific job openings. Share RecruitMilitary social media postings about the upcoming event.Live Tweets: We tweet photos and updates of veterans and organizations making connections in real time during our job fairs (@RecruitMilitary). We love adding tweets from our exhibitors to bring additional exposure their way, such as: Very busy booth today – meeting great veteran talent in Cincinnati #RMHire.StayDon’t leave the career fair early! We discourage our veterans from leaving an event early, often leading them to take another lap around the venue. We’ve had clients make hires at the very end of the day. You may miss your ideal candidate!Advance preparation and audience engagement can reap big dividends at a RecruitMilitary hiring event. Going into the event with a solid game plan will help you have a satisfying career fair experience that leads to hiring veterans.Success StoryMany of the companies who hire veterans at our job fairs come back for more, bringing those hires along to recruit others. Social media grabbed the attention of one Navy veteran and prompted him to attend a RecruitMilitary Veteran Career Fair.“I saw a RecruitMilitary Career Fair coming to Tulsa on my Facebook feed. I signed up, sent my suit to the cleaners, tailored my resume and looked up who would be there,” he said. “I talked to everyone at the event, came away with two interviews and two offers, and I took one of them.”Now he works as a maintenance supervisor/facilities maintenance manager for a large equipment company. One year later, he returned to the same RecruitMilitary hiring event to assist the recruiting team in hiring more veterans.I'm a...Job SeekerEmployerEducatorFranchisorAd AgencyGovernment AgencyResourcesAll ResourcesIn the NewsResources for Job SeekersResource CenterEducationJob FairsJob SearchJob Seeker BlogResources for EmployersCareer Fair CenterEmployer Best PracticesComplianceConnecting with VeteransEmployer BlogTalent AcquisitionSearch & EmployCurrent IssueRecent IssuesAdvertiseSubscribeSolutionsFor EmployersFor Ad AgenciesFor EducatorsFor FranchisorsFor Government AgenciesAboutMissionTeamPartnersHelpContact UsSearchSubmitLinkedInFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTube© 2021 RecruitMilitary.
