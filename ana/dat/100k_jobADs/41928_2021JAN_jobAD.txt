Starting A New Job After the Holiday Weekend!nascar_paul Member Posts: 287 ■■■□□□□□□□June 2016 in IT Jobs / DegreesIt’s taken about a year to find the right fit, but it was well worth the time. I’ve accepted a position doing server support for HP and I’m moving on up and out from the user support that I’ve been doing for two years now. I’ve got a lot to learn, but I’m SUPER excited about the opportunity!Thanks a lot guys, for all of your support and advice! I would have gotten there eventually on my own, but it would have taken (at least) twice as long without your insight and experience!You guys (and girls) ROCK!2017 Goals: 70-411 [X], 74-409 [X], 70-533 [X], VCP5-DCV [], LX0-103 [], LX0-104 []\"I PLAN to fail!\" - No One Ever0 · Share on FacebookShare on TwitterCommentsdanny069 Member Posts: 1,025 ■■■■□□□□□□	June 2016Congrats Nascar_Paul!I am a Jack of all trades, Master of None0 · Share on FacebookShare on TwitterTrucido Member Posts: 250 ■■□□□□□□□□June 2016Grats!!2017 Certification GoalsCompTIA A+ [ ] CompTIA Net+ [ ] CompTIA Sec+ [ ] CCENT [ ] ITIL [ ]0 · Share on FacebookShare on TwitterITSpectre Member Posts: 1,040 ■■■■□□□□□□	June 2016Congrats!In the darkest hour, there is always a way out - Eve ME3 :cool:“The measure of an individual can be difficult to discern by actions alone.” – Thane Krios0 · Share on FacebookShare on TwitterCyber_space Member Posts: 48 ■■□□□□□□□□June 2016Congrats, Keep moving up!0 · Share on FacebookShare on Twittercoffeeluvr Senior Member NCMember Posts: 734 ■■■■■□□□□□June 2016Congratulations on the new gig!!\"Something feels funny, I must be thinking too hard. - Pooh\"0 · Share on FacebookShare on TwitterJoJoCal19 California Kid Mod Posts: 2,829 ModJune 2016Congrats on the new position!Have: CISSP, CISM, CISA, CRISC, eJPT, GCIA, GSEC, CCSP, CCSK, AWS CSAA, AWS CCP, CEHv8, CHFIv8, ITIL-F, MS Cyber Security - USF, BSBA - UF, MSISA - WGUCurrently Working On: Python, OSCP PrepNext Up:​ OSCPStudying:​ Code Academy (Python), Bash Scripting, Virtual Hacking Lab Coursework0 · Share on FacebookShare on Twitteralias454 Member Posts: 648June 2016Congrats, maybe I'll give you a call someday.“I do not seek answers, but rather to understand the question.”0 · Share on FacebookShare on TwitterDanielm7 Member Posts: 2,304 ■■■■■■■■□□June 2016Congrats on the new job!0 · Share on FacebookShare on TwitterTheFORCE Senior Member Member Posts: 2,298 ■■■■■■■■□□June 2016Congratulations!
