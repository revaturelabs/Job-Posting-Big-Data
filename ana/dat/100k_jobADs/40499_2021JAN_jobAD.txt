When attending keep an open mind and listen. Talk to people and mingle. Write down as much information as possible about companies, other events, key players, niche opportunities with the industry that might be interesting, and take as much free literature as you can. Be sure to chat with a few people that you believe can give you some information and don’t be afraid to be honest about your goal at the conference.3.Talk to friends and familyYou will be truly surprised to find out some people that your family and friends may know! And by simply picking their brain they might not know that they know someone that can help you find a job that you will love! Be sure to keep a database (excel spreadsheet) and write down when you spoke to your friend or family member and the possible contact that they have.4.Cold calling companiesThis may be a little old fashioned, but if you are truly gun-ho and dead-set on finding a job that you will love you will have no problem to pick up the phone and talk to someone that can help you! Simply find a few companies in the industry you want to work in. Then do a lot of research on those companies. Be sure to read up on up-to-date news that you can find on press releases and online materials usually found on their websites.Don’t underestimate the power of a search engine like Google for you job search. By typing different search strings you can find a wealth of information about companies and key people who work there. And when you are all set prepare you information and make the call. Sometimes you won’t be able to get them on the phone immediately. Be patient. It sometimes takes time. When you do, don’t ask for anything. Tell them the nature of your call and when they have sometime to answer a few questions you have. If they accept, that is a small victory for you. If they don’t, don’t worry you made a significant step and made a call.5.Research job boards.Scanning job boards is vital to finding what your industry of your choosing is hiring. Make note of certain skills you might lack or experience that you may have to get in order to fill specific roles. Use a word document and write down key words, skill sets, experience, certificates and maybe even volunteer experience that may help you land a job that you will love.6.Find a recruiterSometimes calling up a recruiter is a good way to finding out more about a certain industry. A recruiter or head-hunter sometimes focuses on a specific industry. They may have contacts and knowledge of that industry that may be helpful to find a job that you will love. Just remember you might not end up getting a job through a recruiter. It just might not work out. Regardless, if you have gotten any information via a recruiter it’s sometimes worth its weight in gold.7.Contact an educatorThere are teachers and professors at colleges or universities that can be a boon to find a job that you love. For example, colleges have many teachers who come from or are currently employed in the industry that you are trying to get more information about. Reach out to a few teachers at several institutions. Be upfront about the nature of your email or call.Image: RawPixelShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...RelatedPosted byBrian Trota October 25, 2018 November 11, 2018 Posted inJob SearchTags:Cold Calling for a Job, Job Search, job website, Networking, Recruiter	Published by Brian Trota	Brian Trota was born and raised in Toronto.
