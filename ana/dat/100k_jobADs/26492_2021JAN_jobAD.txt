Increases in gross domestic product (GDP) under McCain are, on average, nearly three times higher than under Obama.As McCainiac states,Jobs will be the most important thing for our economy the next five to ten years. If predictions of a severe recession or depression are true (and I believe they are), then the most important thing is keeping as many people as possible employed. People with jobs pay bills, buy goods and pay rent or a mortgage.People with jobs also pay taxes to fund all that government spending. When millions are out of work and unemployment is over ten percent (or 25 percent during the last depression), that’s a lot of people with little purchasing power, let alone any sense of any financial security.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)MoreClick to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...RelatedTaggedGDPHeritage FoundationJob growthJohn McCainGary Aminoff Commercial Director at KW Commercial Inglewood and Beverly Hills; Principal at Aminoff Realty Advisors.
