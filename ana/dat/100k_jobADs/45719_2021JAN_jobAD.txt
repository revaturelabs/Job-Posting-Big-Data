Policy Manager, Emma Scowcroft said:“We know the number of vulnerable families facing multiple problems in the UK is growing. Our research with the Children’s Society and NSPCC predicts that the number of children living in families with five or more vulnerabilities is set to rise by 54,000 to 365,000, an increase of around 17% by 2015.“We strongly support the BMA’s calls for early intervention. From our own work with families and communities all over the UK, we know that it transforms lives and creates real savings in the long term – up to £1.3bn a year.”*This figure was calculated using the SROI developed by NEF (2008) to primarily provide figures on Action for Children’s East Dunbartonshire Family Support service, assessing the programme’s success in preventing children from going into care. This figure takes into account the savings of £0.8 billion the Coalition Government would make from not providing family support services to every child across the UK at risk of going into care. Cutting these services would be a false economy, as many more children would be taken into care at a cost of £2.1 billion. This gives a net cost of £1.3 billion (£2.1 billion minus £0.8 billion). Commissioned by Action for Children, research was conducted by New Philanthropy Capital.Comments are closed.RSS FeedNews & JobsNews stories and job vacancies from our member agencies, the fostering sector and the world of child protection and safeguarding as a whole.Browse CategoriesAllAction For ChildrenBarnardosBarnardo'sBreakCommunity Foster CareFFP NewsFostering NewsFtSE Member NewsFtSE NewsIndustry NewsKasper FosteringMember Job OpportunitiesMember Job OpportunityMember NewsNew Routes FosteringPactSSt Christopher'sSupported Fostering ServicesTACTTeam FosteringThe Caldecott FoundationThe Children's Family TrustThe Foster Care Co OperativeThe Foster Care Co-operativeTogether TrustYoung People At HeartBrowse News ArchivesJanuary 2021December 2020November 2020October 2020September 2020August 2020July 2020June 2020May 2020April 2020March 2020February 2020January 2020December 2019November 2019October 2019September 2019August 2019July 2019June 2019May 2019April 2019March 2019February 2019January 2019December 2018November 2018October 2018September 2018August 2018July 2018June 2018May 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017October 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016November 2016October 2016September 2016August 2016July 2016June 2016May 2016April 2016March 2016February 2016January 2016December 2015November 2015October 2015September 2015August 2015July 2015June 2015May 2015April 2015March 2015February 2015January 2015December 2014November 2014October 2014September 2014August 2014July 2014June 2014May 2014April 2014March 2014February 2014January 2014December 2013November 2013October 2013September 2013August 2013July 2013June 2013May 2013April 2013March 2013February 2013January 2013December 2012November 2012October 2012September 2012August 2012July 2012June 2012May 2012April 2012March 2012February 2012January 2012December 2011September 2011April 2011September 2009February 2008October 2007The Fairer Fostering Partnershipc/o TACTThe Courtyard303 Hither Green LaneLondon​SE13 6TJinfo@fairerfostering.org.ukHomeAbout UsAn IntroductionHow To Become A MemberApplication FormTerms of ReferenceConstitutionCharterChair and Vice ChairMember AgenciesNews & JobsUseful LinksContact Us"
