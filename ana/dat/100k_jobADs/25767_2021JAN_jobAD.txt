The other CCGs in the alliance are: High Weald Lewes Havens, Crawley, and Horsham and Mid Sussex.The alliance will be split into north and south, each of which will have a managing director – meaning that no existing CCG accountable officer is left without a role.Wendy Carberry, accountable officer for High Weald Lewes Havens, will be managing director for the south, while Geraldine Hoban, accountable officer for Crawley and Horsham and Mid Sussex, will become managing director for the north. Other executive posts will be appointed by January but redundancies are not expected.Mr Doyle is credited with turning round Brighton and Hove CCG, which has gone from being rated inadequate by NHS England to good, and has come out of special measures.Both Crawley and Horsham and Mid Sussex CCGs are rated as inadequate, while High Weald Lewes Havens is rated good.The four CCGs’ main acute providers are Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust and Surrey and Sussex Healthcare Trust.
