The change in uniform has the potential to impact more than 300 jobs, 30 to 40 of which are at Northwest Woolen Mills in Woonsocket, said Max Brickle, president of The Brickle Group, which owns Northwest Woolen.Lt. Jessica Anderson, chief of naval personnel spokesperson, said the synthetic parka was selected “to reduce current Navy seabag uniform component requirements.\"She said the parka was chosen for its modern appearance, lightweight fabric and its ability to protect against inclement weather.\"We're always working to improve and enhance our uniforms' appearance, performance, utility, comfort and wear,\" she said.She also said the parka would eventually \"reduce cost to the Navy’s annual uniform budget.”Until the change becomes effective, sailors’ bags are required to contain the $145.50 wool peacoat and a $104.15 all-weather coat. The $321.46 parka will replace both coats. Anderson said the cost of the parka is expected to decrease significantly as production increases.The peacoat will become an optional item that sailors can purchase independently. Brickle predicts a significant loss in peacoat sales.“Are [sailors] going to go out and buy a garment, with their own money, that is expensive?” he said. “Probably not.”Currently, NEXCOM and Propper, a military supplier headquartered in Missouri, produce the parka at Propper’s manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico.“For us, as this peacoat drifts to Puerto Rico, it signifies a shift — that the military is OK with moving production offshores,” said Jacob Long, CEO of American Woolen. “This peacoat represents more than a piece of business, it represents the U.S. governments ability to try and help build small business enterprise within the textile supply chain.”The East Coast produces many textile products in clusters, rather than through a vertically integrated model where all steps of a manufacturing process are completed by one business. The clusters rely on small to midsize businesses that lend their expertise to different steps of the manufacturing process.The “peacoat cluster” manufactures between 40,000 and 60,000 coats annually, Brickle said, and has been doing so for 20 years. Sterlingwear of Boston makes the finished coat in Massachusetts with fabric the company buys from American Woolen Company in Connecticut, and from Northwest Woolen. The wool fibers are spun and dyed respectively by two Pennsylvania companies.Brickle estimates that when the peacoat changes from mandatory to optional, manufacturing will drop to less than 5,000 coats annually.Though all the businesses in the cluster manufacture other products, the peacoat generates more than $3 million in revenue annually for Northwest Woolen, $10 million for Sterlingwear, and it represents 20 percent of total revenue for American Woolen.Jack Foster, director of marketing at Sterlingwear, said a diminished demand for peacoats could affect up to 200 jobs at the company. The garment contributes to more than half of its revenue.Members of the textile cluster are pained to see the Navy replace an “iconic” item. Long, CEO of American Woolen, said the peacoat was the first contract American Woolen signed when it reopened the mill and joined the cluster in 2014.“There’s a lot of history with that garment, and a lot memories with that garment,” said Foster, who grew up in a Navy family in Middletown. “I remember my father when he was shipped out, everyone would line up on the deck of the ship, dressed in their peacoats.”Sign up for daily e-mailsHome© Gannett Co., Inc. 2021.
