Other partners in the project are Imperial College, UK; Realeyes, Estonia; ARM, UK; RTWH Aachen, Germany, Monoidics, UK, ENS, France and Rightware, Finland.Within the context of the CARP project, the PhD student will workin particular on:- requirements analysis for accelerator programming- the formal semantics of an intermediate programming language for describing accelerator algorithms- developing logic-based verification techniques for this intermediate programming language, taking into account common accelerator programming patternsRead more...open post-doctoral position (INRIA Bordeaux, France)by Emilie Balland, June 6, 2011Design-driven Development for Resilient SystemsPhoenix Research Group (http://phoenix.inria.fr), INRIA Bordeaux, FranceThe objective of this postdoctoral fellowship is to propose a development methodology for resilient systems that takes into account dependability concerns in the early stages and ensures the traceability of these requirements throughout the system life-cycle, even during runtime evolution. To provide a high level of support, this methodology will rely on a design paradigm dedicated to sense/compute/control applications. This design will be enriched with dependability requirements and used to provide support throughout the system life-cycle. This work is part of a collaborative project with the ADAM research group (INRIA, Lille) and the TSF research group (LAAS, Toulouse).Read more...Two 3-year Research Assistants - PLanCompS project - Swanseaby Peter Mosses, May 18, 2011Applications are invited for two 3-year Research Assistant posts at Swansea in connection with the PLanCompS project. These posts provide an excellent opportunity for researchers interested in the formal specification and implementation of programming languages.Read more...Post-doctorate position on model-driven engineering embedded software architectures at INRIA, Rennesby Jean-Pierre Talpin, May 2, 2011A post-doctorate position is vacant at INRIA (Rennes, France) to participate in a collaborative effort to design, implement and case study a toolset that supports co-modeling embedded software architectures from multiple design views: functional, structural and interfaces. The objective of the post-doctorate will be to participate and contribute in the theoretical and practical challenges of designing this framework. Results will be validated through an industrial case study to be conducted in direct collaboration with the partners of the project.Read more...open post-doc position at INRIA Bordeaux, Franceby Emilie Balland, April 21, 2011The objective of this postdoctoral fellowship is to propose a development methodology for resilient systems.
