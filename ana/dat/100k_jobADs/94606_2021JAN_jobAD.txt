There are three things that employers do that may ruin the chances of getting a firm “yes” from a deaf or hard of hearing candidate by doing any or all of the following:1.	After many rounds of interviews, employers are waiting on approvals or references or other business “red tape” before a job offer is made to the top candidate. This could end up being three or more weeks after the first interview and talented candidates don't typically stay on the market long. Chances are, they are also interviewing with other deaf organizations. If at all possible, try to speed up the process to show the top candidate that they're not the second choice.2.	At times, employers are unrealistic in with their time frames. After making candidates wait weeks for a job offer, they offer no flexibility in the start date. Employers should respect the top candidate who wants to tie up loose ends with their previous employer and allow for a flexible start date. This could include working part-time for the new organization while finishing up other tasks and transitioning team members from the other organization.3.	It is understandable that there is always a budget for the position, but there should be room for negotiation. Especially when the request is reasonable, employers should allow room for salary discussion. If employers truly cannot budge on the salary, consider other perks such as offering to cover relocation costs, giving additional vacation time, or give a sign-on bonus, etc.Don't let ineffective hiring practices, tight budgets, or ambiguity with the start date cost you the deaf or hard of hearing candidate you really want.Looking for deaf and hard of hearing candidates?
