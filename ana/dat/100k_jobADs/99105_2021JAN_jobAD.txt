Keeping our infrastructure up to date should be at the top of every administration's agenda. We shouldn't have to worry about bridges collapsing under normal traffic loads – that in itself is not the mark of a modern progressive nation.January 23, 2009 at 8:14 pm |« Back to main« previous postnext post »About this Show:SubscribeAnderson Cooper goes beyond the headlines to tell stories from many points of view, so you can make up your own mind about the news.
