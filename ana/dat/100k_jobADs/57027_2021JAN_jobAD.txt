Since then, the company’s 25 developers have been very impressed by the tremendous improvement in their production environment.“We have been extremely happy,”Gilfillan said.“Our experience shows that Windows 2000-based machines perform flawlessly under the most demanding conditions, which increases the overall positive perceptions of our site.”In addition, ComputerJobs.com is deploying Windows 2000 Professional on 26 desktops and 12 laptops. With Windows 2000 Professional, Gilfillan said the company is getting the hardware compatibility and ease of use of Windows 98, combined with the stability and power of Windows NT. Gilfillan also applauded the advanced power management capabilities of Windows 2000 Professional. In part, ComputerJobs.com selected Windows 2000 to take advantage of the simplified and centralized administration. The result: The company is able to support its 40 production Web servers with only five site engineers.“With Windows NT 4.0, whenever you had to adjust something, you had to bring up a different tool,”said Jack Williams, senior vice president of Product Development and Technology at ComputerJobs.com.“With Windows 2000, machine setup and product management are simplified because you can make all the adjustments using the Management Console.”ComputerJobs.com had yet another goal. The company wanted to bring its production servers online faster to respond to rapidly scaling traffic. Since migrating to Windows 2000, it has easily accomplished this mission. The company has ramped from 10 million page views in January to nearly 20 million page views in April, while cutting installation time by about two-thirds. In addition, Williams expects installation times to decrease further – to only a few minutes per install – once the company begins using the Windows 2000 Active Directory TM service and further automates the process.“ComputerJobs.com is a glowing testament to the many reasons dotcom companies choose Windows 2000 to run their e-commerce site,”said John O’Hara, lead product manager of the Business and Enterprise Division at Microsoft.“When such companies experience tremendous growth, Windows 2000 provides for a cost-effective scale-out that growing companies require.”Lastly, Windows 2000 has provided a critical benefit sought by every Internet company: an enhanced user experience for its computer-savvy user base. Since the migration, ComputerJobs.com has found that the delivery speed of HTML and ASP pages has jumped by at least 30 percent.“We’ve had customers commenting on the responsiveness of the new regions as we rolled the Windows 2000-based machines into areas of the site they use,”Williams said.“Increased performance also helps us control our data center growth and simplify management by reducing the number of machines required to service our Web site.”Founded in 1975, Microsoft (Nasdaq“MSFT”) is the worldwide leader in software, services and Internet technologies for personal and business computing. The company offers a wide range of products and services designed to empower people through great software – any time, any place and on any device.Related PostsThe building blocks of Microsoft’s responsible AI program	Fast, reliable internet connectivity brings new hope to rural villages	New devices and resources for educators at this week’s BettFest 2021	Cruise and GM team up with Microsoft to commercialize self-driving vehicles	Industry leaders to showcase quantum computing solutions at free Feb. 2 workshop	Follow us:Facebook	Twitter	Check us out on RSS	Share this page:What's newSurface DuoSurface Laptop GoSurface Pro XSurface Go 2Surface Book 3Microsoft 365Windows 10 appsHoloLens 2Microsoft StoreAccount profileDownload CenterMicrosoft Store supportReturnsOrder trackingVirtual workshops and trainingMicrosoft Store PromiseFinancingEducationMicrosoft in educationOffice for studentsOffice 365 for schoolsDeals for students & parentsMicrosoft Azure in educationEnterpriseAzureAppSourceAutomotiveGovernmentHealthcareManufacturingFinancial servicesRetailDeveloperMicrosoft Visual StudioWindows Dev CenterDeveloper CenterMicrosoft developer programChannel 9Office Dev CenterMicrosoft GarageCompanyCareersAbout MicrosoftCompany newsPrivacy at MicrosoftInvestorsDiversity and inclusionAccessibilitySecuritySitemapContact MicrosoftPrivacyManage cookiesTerms of useTrademarksSafety & ecoAbout our ads© Microsoft 2021"
