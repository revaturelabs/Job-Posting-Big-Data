The world’s largest professional network launched its first standalone mobile app called LinkedIn Job Search in the iTunes App Store.LinkedIn Job Search promises to provide total privacy for job seekers along with all the tools they need to easily find a dream job, a rarity in the social media world.The new app offers streamlined end-to-end experience with customized search options that will help users find job opportunities quickly wherever they want with location-based search. The app also sends automatic recommendations and notifications based on saved searches, jobs viewed so that users can apply with LinkedIn profile with just a couple of taps. User profile can be used as resume when applying to a job. One can also use new advanced searching options to filter jobs with greater specifics such as job title, location, company, industry or even seniority level.Users can click on the blue Apply button when they find a job opening that they wish to apply for.They can also click on the Save button to track the job or perhaps take some time to think and apply later. Application is done either through the app sending the user’s LinkedIn profile information to the company or through the company website that the user is applying for, to which the app connects when the Apply button is clicked. The app’s notification center notifies the user if a submitted application has been viewed by the company, or if a job opening that matches the user’s saved searches is posted.Last year, LinkedIn did a bit of revamping to its mobile and web apps and also added some additional features too. In April, the company reported massive growth in mobile traffic and expects more than 50 percent of its traffic to come through mobile later in the year. Essentially shifting to mobile platform is a global phenomenon and obviously LinkedIn too wants to cash in on mobile traffic.The LinkedIn Job Search app for iPhone is now available for download from the Apple App Store and the app for Android will likely be launched later this year; though there is no clear timeline indicated. It is now available in the US and expected to reach other regions soon.Anna DomanskaAnna Domanska is an Industry Leaders Magazine author possessing wide-range of knowledge for Business News.
