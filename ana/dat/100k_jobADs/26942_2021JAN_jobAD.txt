It was too long at two pages for recruiters to take seriously, and it was not easily found by complicated applicant tracking systems.With Resume RewritingAs you can see, the process goes much deeper than editing. Our goal is to reevaluate everything to make sure you're maximally attractive to recruiters and the applicant tracking systems they use. (What's an applicant tracking system?)AfterThis final resume presented the applicant as an ideal candidate, with professional formatting, no glaring errors, and a thorough outline of his experience, valuable for hiring managers and applicant tracking systems alike. This exact resume (with a different name) led to multiple job offers and a large salary increase.Top QuestionsWill I be able to talk with my resume writer?Yes! Most companies don't allow this, but we do. You can work directly with your resume writer via email to clarify any details.Can you deliver my resume faster than four days?We can! We deliver most packages in under four calendar days (96 hours). If you provide your employment experience, education, skills, and links to ideal jobs right away, we can likely deliver your package in two to three days. Contact us if you're in a rush.Do you write resumes for part-time consulting work?Absolutely. We have written resumes for many software professionals seeking consulting work. As well, we have helped translators who are looking for part-time or contract work as opposed to full-time employment.Not ready to order? Here’s why most people choose us:1. Grammar and spelling errors cost 40% of applicants their dream jobs.According to the London Evening Standard, hiring managers throw out 40% of all applications because of spelling and grammar errors. That’s 4 out of 10 people! Since over $100,000 can hinge on a single document, we certainly recommend a second set of eyes.2. Only a fraction of resumes are actually read by a human.Most employers use applicant tracking systems (ATS) that work like this: With an 80% match of the right keywords, your resume will be sent to a hiring manager, while a 60–79% match might not be enough. And anything below a 60% match normally means your resume will just sit in a digital pile forever. Our resume writers have spent years learning how to place the right keywords in the right places and in the right quantities to get your resume in front of a human.3. It’s our job to brag for you.Some people shy away from speaking highly of themselves, understating their qualifications. Hiring an expert to write your resume will keep the content professional and unbiased while still drawing attention to your strengths and accomplishments.4. You will make—yes, make!—money.The longer you are unemployed or underemployed, the longer you aren’t earning. If a professionally written resume can help you get a job more quickly—and it can—the more quickly you’ll be making money again. If you’re having trouble landing interviews, perhaps it is time to consider having your resume written by a professional.5. Jobseekers we've worked with rave about us and get results.When I first contacted ProofreadingServices.com, my resume concerns were that the content was just a list of tasks and the overeducation was a turnoff. After their consultations, they were able to highlight specific accomplishments to quantify my background. With the new resume, I can confidently apply to more lucrative job openings. In fact, the last job I had saw a 67% increase in hourly salary. This service was definitely a worthwhile investment.—Marvin, an accountant seeking higher payI think the best reason to use ProofreadingServices.com is peace of mind. The types of documents I had them review were highly scrutinized by medical school admissions committees, and one flaw could have led to very unfavorable outcomes.—Jennifer, a medical school applicantTheir writing is truly something else. I've used other services for cover letters, and this is far and away the best. Indeed, on occasion, I have sent cover letters completed by other sites to ProofreadingServices.com, and what they have returned has been in another class.—Martin, a business development manager looking for a job with better compensationThank you for the rewrite. I got three interviews in the week since the resume rewrite, one with an organization that had turned me down numerous times before. I can't thank you enough.—Frank, an administrative support professionalI am thrilled with the results of my resume rewrite. Jana was an absolute pleasure to work with, finding out exactly what I wanted my resume to say. Since I posted my new and improved resume on Indeed.com yesterday, two recruiters have already reached out to me regarding editorial positions I'm actually interested in (rather than the insurance sales or customer service jobs they normally contact me about). I couldn't be more pleased, and I will definitely refer your company to friends and colleagues who are looking to have their resumes rewritten. Thank you!—Kate, a writer seeking magazine writing and editing positionsThey did a great job on my resume. They changed my incorrect use of words and fixed inconsistent formatting, and most of all, it's just nice to have that peace of mind—a second pair of eyes. I give them a 10/10 and will be using them any time I have something important to write for my job search. They did an incredible job, and that peace of mind is worth a billion dollars. Job well done! Thank you so much!—Starvon, a regional sales director looking to transition into event managementYour service is not like the other resume writing services out there. You guys actually took into consideration what I wrote and helped me express it with the right words, and you provided comments to not only help me but you also explained why it should be fixed! Love you guys.—Andrea, a product management consultant seeking full-time positionsThe team did amazing work, very detailed work. They rewrote sentences in order to make the meaning clearer. What I love is there were little notes asking confirmation about whether the new sentence referred to what was meant. Moreover, the result came earlier than the expected time frame. It's worth it. Excellent! Keep up the good work.—Dewi, a virology Ph.D. seeking research positionsSee more testimonialsHave questions?
