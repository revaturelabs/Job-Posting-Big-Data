LOGIN.It will not stop asking me to relogin even though im logged in.When I login it brings me to a BLUE Odesk screen (my profile page)... when I click on the job I post to view, it brings me to the GREEN Odesk screen... which shows me as logged out.Whats a matter with the system?0 KudosReplyModeratorValeria K Member Since: Mar 6, 2014Mark as NewBookmarkSubscribeSubscribe to RSS FeedPermalinkPrintEmail to a FriendReport Inappropriate Content2 of 2Nov 25, 2014 12:52:34 AM by Valeria KI am sorry about the issue you are experiencing, Michael.
