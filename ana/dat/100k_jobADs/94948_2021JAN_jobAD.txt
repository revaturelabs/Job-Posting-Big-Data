Recruitment of students based on GATE score has been introduced from GATE 2012, hence your score in GATE 2011 is invalid.More over you haven't mentioned from which stream you belong to as only EEE, ECE and Mechanical students are eligible to apply for Government sector jobs through GATE.The govt companies that will allow admission through GATE 2012 are as follows :BHELNTPCIOCLPower GridWith GATE 2012 results also coming out, the chances of you getting an opportunity to apply for govt jobs is nil. So, if your interested in applying for some of the government sector then you must write GATE in next year i.e GATE 2013, where some of govt sector companies might add up for recruitment.All the best.@ S.VenkateshwaruluReply With Quote28-03-2012 03:46 PM #7UnregisteredRe: Please suggest Government jobs on the basis of GATE qualification?i have attempted gate2012.i belong to civil dept nd i am qualified...but i have not applied for govt jobs prior in jan...do i have any chance of applying for govt jobs nowReply With Quote28-03-2012 03:59 PM #8UnregisteredRe: Please suggest Government jobs on the basis of GATE qualification?i have attempted gate2012.i belong to civil dept nd i am qualified...but i have not applied for govt jobs prior in jan...do i have any chance of applying for govt jobs nowReply With Quote29-03-2012 12:24 AM #9KunalroyJoin DateOct 2011LocationDurgapurPosts2,108Re: Please suggest Government jobs on the basis of GATE qualification?Unfortunately you cannot apply based on GATE2011 score.You need to have qualified and scored high to be eligible for 2012 recruitments.You can get admission in M.Tech through 2011 scorecard.And anyhow you cannot apply now as most of the PSUs have completed their application process before the exam.Reply With Quote29-03-2012 11:57 AM #10rehan22222Join DateFeb 2012Posts331Re: Please suggest Government jobs on the basis of GATE qualification?yes , there are many core companies which are looking for a good gate rankerif you have secured a good gate rank , then you will have only interview in many core companies .you will have technical jobs in core companies .with a good gate rank , you are eligible for a job in many core companies like ,~~ bhel~~ bsnl~~ iocl~~ isro~~ ongc~~ sail~~ gail~~ mtnl~~ ntpc , etc..if you are from ECE branch , then you will have many vaccnies and diffeent posts in these companies when compard to EEE , MECHANICAL , CIVIL graduatesReply With Quote31-03-2012 03:49 PM #11param pitaJoin DateFeb 2012Posts193Re: Please suggest Government jobs on the basis of GATE qualification?Hello my dear, you cannot apply for govt sector jobs with a GATE scorecard of 2011.
