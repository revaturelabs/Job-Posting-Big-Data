Two maps (remakes from Killzone 2) will be available on Day One as free pre-order bonuses or as paid DLC on PSN.The open beta is now available on PSN.CptGlantonPosted: February 22, 2011 9:24 PMPermalinkScalphunterFloridaI might have some time to get online tonight.

The controls are MUCH tighter than K2, which is a great thing. There is still a 'weighty' feel when you do some things, but it seems to be a lot more accurate. I wish you could slide into cover in multi like you can in single, but other than that, I think I played 4-5 games of warzone and had a great time.XBL/PS4/Steam: HappytimeHarry9 - SteamDyniPosted: February 22, 2011 11:03 PMPermalinkMight makes RightFirelink ShrineStill waiting on delivery.

Does anyone know if there is a way to switch teams in game.

I also played the first bit of single player, mostly to test out my new headphones. They sound great (I got a pair of Astro A40s). The best part is I can use them on the 360, PS3 and PC without really switching cables around all that much.I have a couple errands to run, then I'll be back for some multiplayer later tonight.

It's good that they give you a few levels this quick so you get some points to unlock some of the secondary abilities. I'm noticing turrets seem much less powerful this time around, and I'm at rank 2 of them.XBL/PS4/Steam: HappytimeHarry9 - SteamSpacePProteanPosted: February 23, 2011 3:34 PMPermalinkDeclaring Martian LawUp the RiverStele wrote:Another rank and I think I'll be past the point I got to in beta, in one day.

Both times, I played on one of the DLC maps, Blood Gracht. I could tell I was doing better than some of the others in the map because I had played the map in KZ2, but it was nice what they did with the aesthetics of the map.I was sick yesterday though, so I didn't want to pour much time in. I hope to hit up Warzone tonight, as Warfare just doesn't give you the same leveling capabilities. At least, I certainly didn't go up 8 levels in only a few games!As a side-note, I'm definitely glad they separated out \"Deathmatch\" from \"Warzone,\" and removed (for now) the ability to make custom games in Warzone. I like the idea of mixing and matching Warzone modes, but it always annoyed the hell out of me when the game creator would increase the times to 20 min per section of Warzone (totally 60 potential minutes of game play), and you wouldn't be able to know this was the case until you'd actually joined the match. I hear Guerilla is talking about adding custom games back into the mix in a future patch, but I really like having a \"Guaranteed Pure Warzone\" button to press.Steam: doctorandy | PSN: ilduce620 | Battle.net: doctorandy#1524 | Bethesda.net: doctorandyspider_j wrote:Pass ilduce on the left hand sideStelePosted: February 23, 2011 5:37 PMPermalinkTIE RequiredNorth CarolinaI reached the levels that were playable in the demo in campaign last night. Fun so far, much much better than K2. Teammate seems more useful, lots more variety of weapons, vehicles, level types. That stealthy level was pretty fun I thought.What Stele said ^ -mortalgrooveSwitch: 6273-9936-5107StelePosted: February 23, 2011 6:14 PMPermalinkTIE RequiredNorth CarolinaHm, patch 1.03 just downloaded.

Not sure if it's for patch 1.03, but it was presented as \"the most recent patch.\"One of note:-- You will no longer have the “Your Faction Has Won/Lost” image roll over into subsequent matchesDefinitely happened to me during my first game last night.A few others that I found interesting, and/or nice:-- New online trophies can be unlocked from the Retro Pack DLC-- Medic: The LS-57 SMG replaces their previously equipped StA-11 SMG-- Medic: The M224-1A LMG replaces their previously equipped LS-13 ShotgunThere are weapon changes for the other classes, as well. Nothing drastic...although, I'm pretty sure I had an LMG as an option last night, and have never seen a Shotgun under the Medic. Could be wrong, though.Anyone have a \"Chosen Class\" yet? I tend to go Medic in almost everything...just curious.Steam: doctorandy | PSN: ilduce620 | Battle.net: doctorandy#1524 | Bethesda.net: doctorandyspider_j wrote:Pass ilduce on the left hand sideStelePosted: February 23, 2011 7:26 PMPermalinkTIE RequiredNorth CarolinaYeah I go medic, have him almost fully upgraded now. But sometimes my team is stupid and doesn't have any Tacticians so I have to do that.Tacticians are so critical to almost every goal in Warzone/Operations, whoever has the closer spawn points will win like 80-90% of the time. Only when the teams are unbalanced is usually when you can win without a forward spawn.Engineers are probably 2nd most critical behind Tacticians, depending on the objective. If it's defend or hold or set bombs and protect, definitely engies. Not just for sentries, but for ammo dumps. Give me an ammo dump with my medic and I can hold down a capture point between my bot and unlimited proximity mines.Fully upgraded infiltrators can sneak by sentries and set objectives faster. But I haven't' seen them used like that very often.Marksman just seems to be about killing. Good for guerrilla I guess, but not super helpful on objective maps.What Stele said ^ -mortalgrooveSwitch: 6273-9936-5107SpacePProteanPosted: February 23, 2011 7:30 PMPermalinkDeclaring Martian LawUp the RiverStele wrote:Fully upgraded infiltrators can sneak by sentries and set objectives faster.

Relatively few Medics, as well. Did see quite a few snipers, though.Steam: doctorandy | PSN: ilduce620 | Battle.net: doctorandy#1524 | Bethesda.net: doctorandyspider_j wrote:Pass ilduce on the left hand sideHappytime HarryPosted: February 23, 2011 8:07 PMPermalinkYou got a problem with that?Manchester NHI was an engineer primarily in K2, and have been trying to do it in K3 but I have had 2 issues. The LMG is terrible. I get lit up constantly from long and short range by SMGs. Turrets, even at level 2 (havent unlocked level 3 yet) are borderline useless. I think I've gotten 2-3 kills scattered over a few games with it.That being said however, the repair tool is indispensable for ammo and gun placements.XBL/PS4/Steam: HappytimeHarry9 - SteamStelePosted: February 24, 2011 1:13 AMPermalinkTIE RequiredNorth CarolinaFinished the campaign.Better than K2, but still some annoyances.#1, why can't I have the damn radar/hud stuff from multiplayer in single-player?! Why do I have to hit up on the d-pad over and over to see my objective, when multi has this nice tracking already. And the radar, jeez. I'm so tired of shooting my own guys, and various other crap. The final mission also really drove home the missing radar, whenSpoiler:you're flying a goddamn spaceship and still can't get radar! Come on. Stupid ass missiles that I could barely see flying at me all the time when just a couple red radar dots could maybe help me aim. :x#2, still some of the old Call of Duty scripting going on. Having a tough time with a fight, just sprint to the frontline and your ai buddies will catch up and clean up for you. Of course if you're hanging back with your buddies they couldn't make a damn kill to save their or your lives.What Stele said ^ -mortalgrooveSwitch: 6273-9936-5107Chairman_MaoPosted: February 24, 2011 1:30 AMPermalinkThe Hans Shot FirstKentGame is ordered, but won't get it till late next month.
