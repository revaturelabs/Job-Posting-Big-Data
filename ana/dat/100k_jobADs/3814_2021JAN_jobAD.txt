It is part of the bodybuilder persona, assume he is screwing up Lake Shore or Lake Park.Lake Park for sure: I didn't even think for a second about it. Not LSD since that is farther from campus. I'm also used to hearing Europeans mess up UChicago and \"Chicago U\" that I was not phased by that either.Well done, OP. That is pure jjh on a happy day.2 years ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist940dSo good. We used to get this stuff all the time, wish would could get this place back to that.If you posted this on the new AEA site, they would pass your email on the Heckman himself2 years ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist6cd8Reject and do no Resubmit. There is no \"South Lake Ave\" anywhere near to UofC. In fact, there is no South Lake Ave anywhere in Chicago and the only Lake avenue is in a cemetery on the north side of Chicago.Obviously he meant Lakeshore Drive. When you get a 500+ like troll then you can complain about such petty nonsense.1 year ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 1 No Jab !Economistf91fHi, JJH!1 year ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist3056OP, by honking at the guy you self-selected yourself for the Heckman correction1 year ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist5c88Still awesome1 year ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist1f53You won't get this kind of gold on the AEA site...1 year ago # QUOTE 2 Jab 0 No Jab !Economistcaf0Reject and do no Resubmit.

When you get a 500+ like troll then you can complain about such petty nonsense.Spoken like someone who has never attended the UofC. GTFO.It's *clearly* Lake Park since that is close to campus and there are stores right on Lake Park. Hell, some people refer to Stony Island as \"Stony\" so \"Lake\" (as the above poster noted) wasn't even a surprise to me.1 year ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist5104Thank you for bumping this.1 year ago # QUOTE 2 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist47ad.2 months ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist9a00Indeed!2 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist4a5bNever forgetti2 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economista629I can't understand it, please explain2 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist61f2Did Heckman really attack some guy? How is it even possible? I imagine he is pretty old and frail.

It's obvious defамation (suggesting Heckman can attack a bodybuilder is ridiculоus), and EJMR is congratulating the guy.
