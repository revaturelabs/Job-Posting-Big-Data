While he struggled, he was still impactful for the Thunder and that led to the team’s fifth win in six games.Or as Westbrook says, just the way he wants it.“As long as we win, I’m good, bro,” Westbrook said on Wednesday. “It’s not really about me. My job is to make sure we win games and that’s it. I’ll be fine. I’m good. As long as we win, that’s all I care about. I think a lot of times, people get caught up in what I’m doing and how I’m doing and don’t worry about our team that’s winning. We’re No. 1 in the West. That’s all that matters. That’s all I care about is winning. I know what I’m able to do and I don’t really worry about none of the other stuff. It’s irrelevant.”Russell Westbrook on finding his rhythm in spite of having some start and stops this season: pic.twitter.com/aR3LrPqIdH— Royce Young (@royceyoung) December 12, 2018Westbrook was visibly upset at himself during the game on Monday against the Jazz as he missed a lot of shots that he has normally made in the past. When he exited the game, Westbrook received a warm ovation from Thunder fans.While he certainly didn’t have the performance he wanted, Paul George came to Westbrook’s defense after the game. George led the Thunder with 31 points but wasn’t concerned with Westbrook’s performance.“I just talked to him in the back and said, ‘It’s an 82-game season.’ I told him, ‘I got your back,'” George said. “He has had me on plenty of occasions when I’ve had an off night and Russ took over offensively and put the game on his shoulders. I’m his counterpart; I’m going to do the same for him when the ball is not going in.“It’s a long season. There are going to be games like that. The special thing about this team is we have two guys that can fill it up on a nightly basis but he’s fine. It’s nothing that he has to get coached through. He’s been a scoring leader; he knows how to score the ball.”At one point this season, Westbrook was averaging a career-high percentage from the field and a career-low percentage from 3-point range. After shooting just 36.7 percent from the field in four December games, his overall percentage has dropped from 46.2 percent down to 44.7.While his overall percentage has dropped a bit from last week, he is still shooting a career-high 52.9 percent on all 2-point shots, as indicated by Basketball-Reference.The Thunder do not seem too concerned with the recent shooting struggles by Westbrook and they shouldn’t be. Westbrook has primarily been known to be a streaky shooter and can still get hot at any point as pointed out by George.Westbrook continues to make the right play and get his teammates involved and that has resulted in the Thunder winning games this season so Westbrook will surely take that.The team is in first place, after all.Share this article	44 sharesshare	tweet	text	email	link	on Facebook	on Twitter	via text message	on LinkedIn	via email	https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2018/12/12/oklahoma-city-thunder-russell-westbrook-rhythm-job-win-games/	Like this article?Sign up for the OKC Thunder Wire newsletter to get our top stories in your inbox every morningEmailSign me up	View all newsletters	More StoriesBleacher Report reviews Thunder rookies Theo Maledon, Aleksej PokusevskiLogan NewmanDecember 12, 2018Early in the 2019-20 season, some analysts and scouts viewed Theo Maledon as a potential lottery pick.As the season progressed, interest waned in the ASVEL guard.
