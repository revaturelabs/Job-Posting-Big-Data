Cailen Ascher explains how we can help to overcome this…Questions that fill our heads…Should I look for a new job?Should I quit?Should I stick it out and hope it gets better?Should I start my own business?There is no one right answer, but there are a few things you can do starting now to make your current situation more enjoyable and reconnect with the reason you started doing this work in the first place. Below are 4 smart, simple ways to give your job more purpose.1 Remember your whyTake some time to reflect on why you started doing this work in the first place. Was it to make a difference, help people live better, have a creative outlet, purchase your first home? There’s no bad reason.List anything and everything that comes to mind and cultivate a little gratitude for the opportunities your work has afforded you.2 Feel a part of something largerYour work is undoubtedly aligned with a greater purpose. Consider what higher power, force or energy you could tap into to help your work feel bigger than just you.Are you serving Learning, Creativity, Compassion, Health, Happiness? When you feel yourself and your work align with something larger, you’ll begin to see how what you do is making a difference not only in your own life but in the lives of others.3 Make room for opportunitiesIf you really feel like your job has become just a paycheck, and you’re ready to move on, it’s important to make space for new ideas and opportunities to come in. Start pursuing your passions NOW and connecting with people that can and will support you as you make this new transition.Always dreamed of being an artist and sharing your artwork with the world? Set up a small studio space in your home and set aside time each week to create something beautiful, take a painting class, or open an Etsy shop online to showcase your work.Having a burning desire to change the world with your words? Start a blog, begin work on your book, submit a freelance piece to your favorite online magazine (maybe Spirit & Soul?!), or plan a lunch date with a friend who is a writer or has connections in the industry.If you can’t find more purpose in your work, start adding purpose to your days outside of work. In all likelihood, it will make your work day feel more purposeful and enjoyable, too.4 Move through your day as your most purposeful selfThis is a fun activity that I’ve begun playing with on days when I feel a lack of motivation or misaligned with my work. I imagine how my most purpose-full self – the future me in 5-10 years who is crystal clear on her mission and aligned with her purpose – would move through her day.How would she respond to that email? What would she do in that situation? How would she infuse more purpose into her life and work? What kinds of activities would she enjoy outside of work? Who would she make connections with in her field? What opportunities would she seek out?When you start to move through your day as your most purpose-full self, you bring more intention and mindfulness into everything you do. You start the evolution process to become that future you who has it all figured out and has a purpose-full job that she LOVES.Author BioCailen Ascher is a Clarity Coach, who works with entrepreneurs to align their purpose and their business so they can stop chasing the dream and start living it.
