This week’s find is an absolute must-visit for décor fans, interior decorators and those looking to refresh their homes without breaking the bank!Exquisite CutsWe love the fact that owner-manager Heather Lund Truter gave up a ten-year career as a private banker in order to start this amazing store in Kramerville. In a nutshell, Exquisite Cuts offers hand-picked short-ends – remnants and end of range fabrics from local and international décor houses. This means that YOU get the best fabrics, but for so much less!The range is constantly evolving and changing as new fabrics become available. I opted for some ready-made cushions to refresh my living room. I was spoilt for choice with a wide range of phenomenal fabrics from which to choose. But it doesn’t stop there – you can also buy discounted upholstery and curtaining fabric at a variety of price points. All of this just makes redecorating so much more affordable and FUN!The Exquisite Cuts teamWhat impressed me most about the store is the passionate and insightful team that does so much more than just sell fabric. They are quick to offer advice, insight, suggestions and creative ideas to help you transform a tired room into something that reflects your family. You can bring photos with you and ask for advice. The team will then help you come up with an action plan that suits your time and budget. I prefer using very inexpensive fabric for curtaining and then ramping up the look with stunning accent cushions – that way, I get a brand new look for a fraction of the price (and yes, I have both “summer” and “winter” cushions – you will too when you visit this amazing shop!)Another bonus is that Exquisite Cuts also offers ready-made curtains (an absolute win for those looking for instant gratification). They have a team of tried-and-tested curtain-makers if you’d like something made to spec.Follow the store on Facebook to keep updated with new fabric lines that become available. In brief, I would highly recommend popping in for a browse and to treat yourself to new cushions for your Master Bedroom or living room. Take photos before you go – you’ll be amazed at what the team suggests and the difference it will make to your space, without breaking the bank.PLUS you get to #SupportLocal!Do YOU have an owner-managed business that you would like us to feature?
