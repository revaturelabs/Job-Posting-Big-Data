Domicile is a person's true, fixed and permanent home. It is the place the person intends to return whenever away. A domicile (in your case, Texas) once established remains until a new one is adopted. Any person who spends more than seven months of the year in OK is considered to be a resident. Since you were there temporarily for Job Corps for less than 7 months, you would not be considered to be a resident of Oklahoma.**Say \"Thanks\" by clicking the thumb icon in a post**Mark the post that answers your question by clicking on \"Mark as Best Answer\"036ReplyAboutTurboTax guaranteesTurboTax security and fraud protectionTax forms included with TurboTaxTurboTax en españolSelf-Employed tax centerTax Expert NetworkTax reform centerTax Refund AdvanceE-file taxes onlineCoronavirus and your taxesSelf Employed COVID-19 ReliefUnemployment Benefits and TaxesOnline Software ProductsTurboTax loginCompare TurboTax productsAll online tax preparation softwareFree Edition tax filingDeluxe to maximize tax deductionsPremier investment & rental property taxesSelf-employed taxesTurboTax® Live tax prepMilitary tax filing discountTurboTax Live Tax Expert ProductsHow TurboTax Live WorksCD/Download ProductsTurboTax CD/download loginCompare CD/download productsAll CD/download productsCheck order statusTurboTax Advantage ProgramTurboTax Business for corpsProducts for previous tax yearsMobile Tax AppsAll TurboTax mobile. appsOfficial TurboTax mobile appTaxCaster refund estimate appItsDeductible donation tracker appHelp and SupportTurboTax SupportContact usTurboTax Advantage supportWhere's My RefundFile an IRS tax extensionPay NY estimated taxesGetting started with TurboTax®Refund status supportCommon tax questionsAfter filing your taxesTax Tools and TipsStimulus Check CalculatorAll tax tips and videosTax calculators & toolsTaxCaster tax calculatorTax bracket calculatorCheck e-file status refund trackerW-4 withholding calculatorItsDeductible donation trackerSelf-employed expense estimatorSocialTurboTax customer reviewsTurboTax blogTurboTax invite-a-friend discountTurboTax Super Bowl commercialCommunityIntuit Tax & Financial CenterMore Products from IntuitTurboTax CanadaTurboTax: Free Credit ScoreMint budget trackerAccounting softwarePayrollQuickBooks PaymentsProfessional tax softwareProfessional accounting softwareMore from IntuitTax Expert Hub: A-DTax Experts for AtlantaTax Experts for BaltimoreTax Experts for BostonTax Experts for CharlotteTax Experts for ChicagoTax Experts for ClevelandTax Experts for DallasTax Experts for DenverTax Experts for DetroitTax Expert Hub: E-NTax Experts for Fort WorthTax Experts for HoustonTax Experts for Las VegasTax Experts for Los AngelesTax Experts for MiamiTax Experts for MinneapolisTax Experts for New YorkTax Expert Hub: O-RTax Experts for OaklandTax Experts for OrlandoTax Experts for PhiladelphiaTax Experts for PhoenixTax Experts for PortlandTax Experts for RaleighTax Expert Hub: S-ZTax Experts for SacramentoTax Experts for St. LouisTax Experts for San DiegoTax Experts for San FranciscoTax Experts for San JoseTax Experts for SeattleTax Experts for TampaTax Experts for Washington D.C.HomeAboutTerms of UsePrivacy© 2021 Intuit, Inc.
