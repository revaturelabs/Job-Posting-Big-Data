Together, Cottage 11 and Cottage 12 at EGCC will serve to house and educate the only female youth in custody in Washington State. The (1,900 square foot) new Classroom Building addition, new Entry Vestibule, and courtyard site improvements are located between the two female youth cottages, creating a shared amenity and campus environment. The outdoor amenities will include a new covered sports-court, plaza, sloped amphitheater lawn, ADA ramp and stair connection. The work will require all new mechanical and electrical systems, with plumbing and low-voltage upgrades and all new lighting. Existing structural foundations, slabs and roof framing will largely be utilized in the new renovation, with new shear walls and new steel columns and beams to support over-framing and larger clear spans in the social areas like the Dayroom and Kitchen / Dining spaces.This is available for download & digital takeoff to registered users Log in nowDetailsPlansSpecsAddenda/OtherPlan HoldersStatusAccepting BidsPrebid Date1/21/21 1:00 pmBid Date2/16/21 3:00 pmCompany & ContactsDLR GroupLorraine Leslie (206) 792-3914LocationSnoqualmie, WAFor Pre-bid instructions, please refer to the “Ad for Bid”.Planroom Home Public Jobs Private Jobs Job CalendarShopping CartItems: 0 Total: $0.00View Cart & CheckoutLoginUsernamePasswordRemember meRegister for an accountForgot password?Planroom provided by Abadan Reprographics | Shipping & Return Policy | DisclaimerCopyright © 2021 | Powered by ReproConnect"
