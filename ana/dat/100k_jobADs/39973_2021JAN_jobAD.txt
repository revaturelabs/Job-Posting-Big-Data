"The Path to Wonderful by Melissa Maris: January 2005: Quitting a Job That Didn’t Fit and Finding One That DidPagesHomeMy StoryCoachingClients' WordsPackagesFree LoveShopInspirationContactWednesday, April 11, 2012January 2005: Quitting a Job That Didn’t Fit and Finding One That DidMy 29th birthday was right around the corner, I was single (and sad about it) and I was almost completely miserable in my job. My super-zen boss was on her way out of the company, and I wanted to follow in her footsteps.I needed to make a change immediately.So I emailed an old freelance contact and tried to set up an escape route. I had a finite amount of money saved and knew if I could supplement it with freelance writing work, I'd be able to get by for a couple of months. Of course, I also dreamed that the freelance gigs would explode and I could turn that into my next career.I quit my downer of a job and felt like a bird who'd been freed from her cage.Because I had made a List describing the dream man I wanted to find in life, I decided to also make a dream job list.One of the first steps in manifesting your desires is getting clear on what you want.I wrote it all down in my journal and then financial fear and worry took over as I scrambled to make ends meet doing writing projects and taking a job as a nanny.By the time April hit, I was down to my last few hundred dollars. My birthday is in April and I was so tired of being stressed that I decided to turn it into a month of worry-free celebration. I made peace with the idea of getting another job (I decided to apply at a coffee house to fill in the gaps between writing jobs) and I opened myself back up to enjoying life.I let go and let the Universe take over.After a particularly positive and magical day spent at, of all places, Disneyland, I came home to find three messages from different recruiters looking to fill semi-permanent copywriting positions.One of these was at Yahoo!, a company that had long appealed to me. I had friends who worked there, it was close to home, and I was fairly certain the pay would be good.When I went in for the interview, I immediately liked the people on the team. \"Smart, fun coworkers\" was one of the top priorities on my Wonderful Job List. Then I found out the salary and was bowled over—it was more than twice what I had been making at my previous job.All my instincts pointed to GO and I felt so certain that not only would the job be an ideal fit for me, I would be an ideal fit for it.They hired me the next day on a three-month contract. After that, another contract was extended, followed by a fulltime permanent position and six years of pretty consistent joy over working for the company.I don't think it's coincidence that a job with all my criteria came to me as soon as I started allowing the Universe to handle things. Allowing is a huge part of manifesting.The unexpected benefit of getting into this new job was that it put me in a place where I was happier in my life—and that made me more attractive in the dating world. Double score.Posted by Melissa Maris at 3:22 PMEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels: allowing, jobs, manifesting, Wonderful ListNo comments:Post a CommentNewer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)Subscribe to Posts by EmailSearch This BlogOther Places You Can Find MeBlog Archive► 2018 (2)► September (1)► August (1)► 2017 (1)► April (1)► 2016 (3)► August (2)► January (1)► 2015 (30)► December (1)► November (2)► October (1)► September (3)► July (3)► June (1)► May (1)► April (1)► March (4)► February (7)► January (6)► 2014 (36)► December (2)► November (2)► October (2)► September (2)► August (4)► June (3)► May (3)► April (4)► March (4)► February (5)► January (5)► 2013 (39)► December (3)► November (5)► October (4)► September (4)► August (1)► July (2)► June (3)► May (4)► April (2)► March (2)► February (5)► January (4)▼ 2012 (46)► December (3)► November (5)► October (4)► September (3)► August (6)► July (5)► June (5)► May (3)▼ April (12)Just Because You Make Your Manifesting Bed Doesn't...What Are You Aligning Yourself With?November 2007: My Last First Date Was So Worth the...July – September 2007: Climbing out of the PitsAnd Now, a Note about the Difference Between Wanti...February 2007: Some of the Best Money I Ever SpentMay 2006: No Gut-Feeling-Trusting, No GloryJanuary 2006: Visual Roadmaps and the Importance o...July 2005: The Anatomy of Settling in RelationshipsJanuary 2005: Quitting a Job That Didn’t Fit and F...2004: Making My First Mr. Wonderful List2004: My Life Was Waiting.
