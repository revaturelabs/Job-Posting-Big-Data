Regardless of how savvy you are, job searching is not always easy. It is important to understand how positions are filled and to develop a strategy that will help in your career quest.Go beyond online job boards and search enginesEighty percent of all employee hires are through the hidden job market. Employers save time and money if they fill positions through referrals from colleagues and their own professional network. They also feel more comfortable hiring a candidate that has been singled out by a trusted source. Be open to connecting with groups both within your profession and outside of work. Information about job leads that may not be advertised typically come from these sources.Be smarter about the way you networkEstablishing or cultivating your professional network is crucial to successfully finding jobs that are not advertised. Your network should include a variety of people—past coworkers, people you have managed, mentors, peers, and clients. Social media makes it easy to manage and cultivate your network. You no longer have to connect with people face-to-face, you have the option to build strong relationships with an online presence. You can show your professionalism, intelligence, and experience by participating in online discussions and by sharing resources. By doing so, group members will become familiar with your name and your work.Target and research companiesRead local and international news for the latest industry news and to stay up-to-date on what is going on with the companies you are interested in.
