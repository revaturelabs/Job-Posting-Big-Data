In line with international and national commitments, UN Women works on the levels of policies and legislation, institutions and grassroots, in order to achieve transformative results for increased gender equality and greater protection of the rights of women and girls. To deliver on leave no one behind (LNOB) – the central and transformative promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, UN Women pays special attention to inclusion and participation of marginalized groups or women and/ or women and girls at risk of social exclusion. Guided by the UN Women global Strategy “The Empowerment of Women and Girls with Disabilities: Towards Full and Effective Participation and Gender Equality (” (UN Women, The Empowerment of Women and Girls with Disabilities: Towards Full and Effective Participation and Gender Equality. 2018. Available at: https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2018/12/the-empowerment-of-women-and-girls-with-disabilities)), UN Women supports national partners to implement their commitments to women and girls with disability under CEDAW, BPfA, UPR, CRPD, 2030 Agenda (SDGs) and other relevant human rights and gender equality and women empowerment (GEWE) normative frameworks.UN Women Georgia Country Office with the generous support of the Joint SDG Fund and in partnership with UNICEF, UNDP, OHCHR, UNFPA and WHO is implementing a Joint Programme (JP) “Transforming Social Protection for Persons with Disabilities in Georgia”. Within the framework of the JP, UN Women contributes to achieving gender equality and empowerment of women and girls with disabilities and ensuring their full and effective participation in life on an equal basis with others. To achieve this goal, UN Women, inter alia, works to enhance visibility of women and girls with disabilities, raise awareness about intersecting forms of discrimination they face based on gender and disability and combat harmful stereotypes and prejudice relating to women and girls with disabilities, including those based on age, race, ethnicity, gender expression class, and type of impairment, in all areas of life.In line with these efforts, UN Women plans to support a social media awareness raising campaign. The campaign will aim to shed light on the nature of harmful stereotypes against women and girls with disabilities and provide citizens with information on how to replace these with attitudes/behaviors that are respectful and informed. The ultimate goal of the campaign is to promote rights and needs of women and girls with disabilities by contributing to desensitizing general public towards their problems and changing the existing culture of disrespectful treatment towards women and girls with disabilities with a more respective, inclusive and empowering culture in which women and girls with disabilities can realize their full potential. The proposed campaign is largely inspired and informed by the ’16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence’ Campaign conducted by the Women with Disabilities Victoria in 2019 ( https://www.wdv.org.au/16dayscampaign/).The campaign messages will be developed and substantiated based on consultations with a number of women with disabilities and will be reflective of their personal experiences.
