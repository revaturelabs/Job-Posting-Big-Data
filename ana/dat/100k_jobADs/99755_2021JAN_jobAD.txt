The sponsor of this call for application is Janssen.An emerging area of science is being focused on identifying strategies to treat patients with immune-mediated diseases that not only block inflammation, but which promote pro-resolution responses in immune cells to restore homeostasis. Recent research findings suggest that tissue factors released during cellular damage, stress or inflammation can drive pro-resolution responses in macrophages.We are seeking project proposals which explore the complex biology of stromal-immune cross-talk and which aim to identify novel pathways and mechanisms that restore homeostasis in autoinflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The project should focus on the following deliverables:Development of novel methodologies to systematically profile and dissect complex tissue microenvironments in order to identify components that induce pro-resolution responses in tissue-resident innate immune cells;Identification of specific and selective novel targets that could be used to trigger pro-resolution responses in innate immune cells without negatively impacting other cell types.Proposals building on very original ideas supported by first experimental findings are particularly encouraged.Group leader positions are intended to suit candidates who would like to develop themselves towards a leadership career path either in academia or industry and have typically between four and eight years of relevant postdoctoral research experience.What we offerA position in a fully funded research group, the funding package covering salaries, consumables, services, travels, as well as access to the core facilities of neighboring research institutions and biotechnology companies in Heidelberg.An initial term of two years, with the possibility of prolongation for up to two additional years.An exciting research opportunity in a multidisciplinary and international research institution with a very collegial and flexible working environment.There is flexibility over starting dates, but successful applicants are welcome to take up post starting May 1, 2021.Application & Selection ProcessPlease apply online at https://apply.bio.mx/call/2020-C01.As part of the online application procedure, you will be asked to submit:A competitive project proposal that gives us an idea of your scientific expertise and creative potential (3-5 pages describing an interesting core hypothesis, scientific rationale, and a unique experimental approach).
