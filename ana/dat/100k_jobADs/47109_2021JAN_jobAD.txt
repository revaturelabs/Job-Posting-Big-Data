"The End of the Jobs Feed ~ MagicAndi's BlogMagicAndi's BlogWill code for cake...HomeAboutLinksRunningProjectsReading ListContact6 Oct 2015The End of the Jobs FeedAlmost 5 years ago, I used Yahoo Pipes to put together a handy RSS feed aggregating jobs from various NI recruitment sites for software developers. Unfortunately, at the end of September, Yahoo Pipes shut down, and my jobs feed is no longer working. If you have been using the RSS feed, please accept my apologies. I completely missed the end of life announcement for Yahoo Pipes (I’ve had other things on my mind this summer). At the minute, I have no plans (or time) to put together a replacement. If anyone is aware of any alternatives for the job feed, please let us know through the comments. Thanks.Posted by Andy Parkhill at 21:35Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestNo comments:Post a commentNote: only a member of this blog may post a comment.Newer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)Contact formNameEmail *Message *SubscribePostsAtomPostsCommentsAtomCommentsSearch This BlogAbout MeI am a software developer from Coleraine, Northern Ireland with over 10 years of experience, primarily in .Net and SharePoint.I am a frequent lurker and an occasional contributor on StackOverflow.com as MagicAndi.Follow MeGitLab GithubSubscribe via emailSubscribe to MagicAndi's Blog by EmailBlog archive► 2021 (1)► January (1)► 2020 (7)► June (4)► April (2)► March (1)► 2019 (3)► October (1)► April (1)► January (1)► 2018 (10)► December (1)► November (1)► October (1)► August (4)► June (1)► May (1)► April (1)► 2017 (6)► November (1)► June (1)► May (1)► April (1)► February (1)► January (1)► 2016 (9)► December (1)► November (2)► October (1)► August (1)► July (1)► June (1)► April (1)► February (1)▼ 2015 (7)► December (1)▼ October (1)The End of the Jobs Feed► April (2)► February (1)► January (2)► 2014 (3)► December (1)► September (1)► January (1)► 2013 (6)► October (1)► May (2)► April (1)► March (2)► 2012 (10)► September (1)► July (1)► April (1)► February (3)► January (4)► 2011 (7)► October (2)► August (1)► July (1)► January (3)► 2010 (45)► December (1)► September (2)► August (6)► July (11)► June (3)► May (12)► April (8)► March (2)Labels#derry2013 2020 apology Articles Azure Best Practices blog migration Blogging bodyweight bookmarks books browsers C# Career Certification China cloud-computing Code community Computer Science Coronavirus data Derry Dublin Events Exams fitness Git GitHub GitLab Goals Hardware Holidays Industry Interviews iphone Jobs jQuery LinkedIn Links Linux Macro maker maker faire Mobile MOSS 2007 Music open source Operating System Personal PowerShell Productivity professional programming projects Quantified Self Quotes Reading Relaxation Resolutions RSS running Scripting SharePoint SharePoint 2001 SharePoint 2003 SharePoint 2007 SharePoint 2010 SharePoint 2013 SharePoint 2016 SharePoint 2019 Social Media Software stackoverflow static site generators SysAdmins teaching Technical testing tools Travel TV Tweet Twitter utility Virtual Machines Visual Studio web applications webdev What I'm Reading Windows x64Copyright NoticeMagicAndi's Blog by Andy Parkhill is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License.© 2010, Andrew Parkhill.Disclaimer:The opinions expressed herein are my own personal opinions and do not represent my employer's view in any way.Powered by Blogger."
