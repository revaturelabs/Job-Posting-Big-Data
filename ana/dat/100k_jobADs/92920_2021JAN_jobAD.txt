I am working with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Maryland.I actually worked as a Realtor from 2005-2007 but moved onto property management and then stumbled into event planning in early 2008. I really thought that I would love event planing but to be honest I never really did, it wasn't bad but it just wasn't for me and for years I've been dying to get back into real estate.When I found out in March that we had lost a major contract and there may be downsizing within the company I immediately signed up to take the RE license class again (I let my license lapse when I left the field so I had to take the class again) and I found that after only 2 classes I felt like I was using my brain again and learning so much so I knew that this was where I needed to be. I waited until decisions were made at my job before I made any moves though.I passed my state licensing exam on June 26th so I am licensed to sell anywhere in the state of Maryland. I will specilize in the county I live in but since MD is such a small state I really can work in any counties that I know and feel comfortable in. So if you know anyone buying or selling a home in Maryland send them my way!I'm working on setting up my website, twitter, and a real estate blog (which will offer general real estate buying/selling info and MD specific info) so once I have all of these rolling I will let you all know.Thanks again for all the encouragement and positive vibes you have been sending me! The blog world really is full of nice, genuine people and I appreciate you all.SHARE:Posted by Nat at 8:49 AM9 commentsMCW July 17, 2012 at 9:01 AMThat is so exciting!
