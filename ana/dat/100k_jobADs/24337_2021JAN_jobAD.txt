Rates of casual work have been stable for the last two decades. The proportion of Australians in short, medium and longer terms jobs is the same in 2018 as it was in 2008,” Canberra Business Chamber CEO, Robyn Hendry explained.“To suggest businesses are driving an increase in casual labour ignores the choices made by the many Canberrans who do not want full-time work for a variety of reasons and require more flexible work options.“For example, casual employment is highest amongst those aged 15-19, who are usually balancing work and school, and in industries such as hospitality and retail where many people get their start in the labour market. However, even these sectors are reporting they have increased permanent staff numbers for greater business efficiencies.”Media Contact: Robyn Hendry, CEO Canberra Business Chamber 0418 462 151Download Media ReleasePost navigation← MEDIA RELEASE: Canberra Cyber Companies Team to go Global	MEDIA RELEASE: Applications for the 2018 ACT Chief Minister’s Export Awards are now open →	MembershipJoinEnquireWorkplace RelationsEventsTrainingInternational TradeOur Advocacy PrioritiesContact UsAbout UsNews & MediaJoin Our Mailing ListOur Privacy PolicySynapse Worldwide | Web design | Web development | SEOSitemap | © 2021 Canberra Business Chamber Limited×CloseBecome A MemberFirst Name*Last Name *Email*MobileBuy Tickets on Eventbrite"
