I am writing to you to recommend one of my best friends, Helen Wang, for this post.-----------------------------*SPONSERS* -----------------------------Helen used to be my classmate at Beijing Normal University, where she was already a very active organizer and participant in extracurricular activities. With her outstanding leadership skills and cheerful personality, she was elected chairperson of the Student Union several times.Busy as she was, she passed the College English Test Band Six and completed her major – teenage psychology – with an excellent school record. Upon graduation she was assigned to be a teacher in an international high school in Beijing, where she has been teaching bilingual lessons for five years. What’s more, she loves her job and enjoys working with children. This has won her great popularity among her students.Therefore, I do not hesitate to recommend her as an ideal candidate for the post you advertised. I am sure you will make a wise decision in hiring her.-----------------------------ADVERTISEMENT-----------------------------Sincerely yours,Victor LiOne of your friends wants to apply for a job involving working with foreign teenagers .Write a letter of recommendation for him/her.One of your friends wants to apply for a job involving working with foreign teenagers .Write a letter of recommendation for him/her.One of your friends wants to apply for a job involving working with foreign teenagers .Write a letter of recommendation for him/her.One of your friends wants to apply for a job involving working with foreign teenagers .Write a letter of recommendation for him/her.Share Via:Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Skype (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)-----------------------------SPONSERS-----------------------------Post navigation← Previous PostNext Post →Leave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
