Hillman and Mattingly were incredibly close on and off the field, so that could be a bit of a weird situation. Wallach has spent three years coaching third base on Mattingly’s staff.Follow @AaronGleemanView 7 CommentsScroll Down For:FOLLOW US Facebook Twitter Instagram NBC Sports Social Directory©2021 NBC UniversalAd Choices Advertise Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Personal Information CA Notice Closed Captioning Pressbox Sports Jobs Our History NBC Sports Terms of Use NBC Sports Live FAQ NBC Sports Gold Int'l Terms of Service NBC Sports Gold FAQGET NEWSLETTERS & ALERTSSIGN UPSend to Email Address Your Name Your Email AddressCancelPost was not sent - check your email addresses!
