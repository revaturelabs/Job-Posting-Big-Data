The protocol operates as a rules-based utility that dynamically adjusts supply based on the CBOE volatility index (VIX) and deviations from the target metric - equal to 1 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) unit.Employing the SDR creates a larger use case rather than exposure to just one currency; this creates a larger user base and delineated exposure to markets around the world. The DeFi space needs a collateral utility that retains its efficacy and increases inherent baseline liquidity during periods of high volatility. Benchmark is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The MARK token is the native asset in the Benchmark network and provides only the utility value available to it through the Benchmark network. The supply of MARK adjusts by tracking the movement of the CBOE volatility index.SummaryIn this position, the Senior Solidity Developer will lead the efforts to integrate Benchmark's blockchain technology across Layer 1 and Layer 2 scalability solutions, sidechains, and alternative blockchains other than ethereum. You will build bridges to top blockchains and gain tremendous experience.Primary DutiesIntegrate native token cross chain bridge for up to a dozen L1 and L2 blockchains/sidechainsDevelop solution for displaying rebalanced token value cross chain where neededIntegrate cross chain tokens in applications such as DEX’sQualificationsAdvanced understanding of blockchain, cryptocurrency markets, DeFi and economic theory;Ability communicate (written and verbal) advanced technical, or economic concepts;Desire to contribute broadly in a startup environment and ability to adapt to needs of the organization;2+ years experience with Solidity developmentBenchmark Protocol is an Equal Opportunity Employer.SkillsSolidityCompensationTo be negotiatedApply on CryptoJobsRelated jobs you might likeBlockchain Engineer (Ethereum/Solidity) RemoteCartesiFull Time TechRemote135 views · posted 23 hours agoBlockchain Developer (s)Blockchain HeadhunterFull Time TechRemote225 views · posted 1 day agoEthereum Developer (NFTs)Collect YieldFull Time Tech 🔥 TrendingRemote Lisbon, Portugal218 views · posted 2 days agoFull-stack Software DeveloperQuazard Financial GamingFull Time Tech 🔥 TrendingRemote365 views · posted 4 days agoShare this opportunity:Post a Job Posting a job is FREE.
