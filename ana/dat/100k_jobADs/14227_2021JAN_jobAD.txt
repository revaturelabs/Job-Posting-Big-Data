This is an opportunity to be involved in the use of state-of-the-art cryo-electron microscopes and the development of computational methods to decipher the structural basis of podosome function and mechanics. The successful candidate will benefit from a collaborative environment with experts in cell biology, mechanics, theoretical physics and biophysics. Together, we use a combination of in situ cryo-electron tomography, nanoscale force measurements, quantitative 3D nanoscopy, computational modelling and biophysical experimental approaches.For more information on our research, please visit our website: www.biochem.mpg.de/6343848/03_Actin_networksRequirements: Candidates with a PhD in Structural Biology, Biophysics, Computational Physics or related fields are welcome to apply. We are looking for someone with a background in computation and image analysis. Prior experience in cryo-EM/ET structure determination (single-particle or subtomogram averaging) is preferred but not required.Application: Please send your CV, the contact information of two references and a brief statement outlining your interests and relevant experience to Marion Jasnin (jasnin@biochem.mpg.de)Tagged as: Computer Science, Life Sciences, PhysicsFacebookTwitterLinkedInRelated Jobs6 Postdoc Positions in in Molecular Biology, Chemistry, Biochemistry & related fields in Mainz, Germany Full-timeInstitute of Molecular Biology Germany MainzThe Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB, www.imb.de) is a centre of basic research on the campus of Mainz University, Germany....ApplyPostdoc in Machine Learning for Single-cell Genomics in Cancer Full-timeHeidelberg University Hospital Germany HeidelbergA postdoctoral position is open in the group of Julio Saez-Rodriguez at Heidelberg University Hospital to develop deep learning methods...ApplyPost-doctoral Fellow in Organoid Technology Full-timeHelmholtz Zentrum München - Institute of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Germany MünchenOur Mission: The newly established Institute for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine (iTERM) develops and implements tools to analyze the...ApplyPostdoctoral Fellow (m/f/x) in Immunology Full-timeInstitute of Clinical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, Universitäts­klinikum Erlangen, and Friedrich-Alexander-Universität (FAU) Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany Germany ErlangenPostdoctoral Fellow (m/f/x) in Immunology Institute of Clinical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, Universitäts­klinikum Erlangen, and Friedrich-Alexander-Universität (FAU) Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany; research...ApplyPostdoc position – MINFLUX – advanced super-resolution microscopy Full-timeUniversity Medical Center Göttingen / Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry Germany GöttingenA postdoc position is available through our DFG-funded project ‘Göttingen MINFLUX’ for a period of 3+1 years in the group...ApplyPost-doctoral Scientist/Data scientist/Decoding Extreme Biology Full-timeMax-Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine Germany BerlinThe Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC) is a leading international biomedical research center with...ApplyJob OverviewDate Posted: Posted 3 months agoDeadline:January 31, 2021Location: GermanyMunich	Closes: January 31, 2021ApplyHow to applyPlease send your application to jasnin@biochem.mpg.deDon't forget to mention that you found the position on jobRxiv!AboutjobRxiv is the free and international job board for scientists, by scientists.Keeping research funds for research.Learn MoreSupport jobRxivWe take your privacy seriously: Read our full Privacy PolicyContactFor any suggestions, comments, questions:Get in touch!© jobRxiv 2020.
