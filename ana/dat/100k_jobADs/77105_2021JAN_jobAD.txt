That will take some time. This project has not been abandoned. Unless information comes from the official source, please disregard online rumors. Indie game dev is a very tough business and the year 2013 is even tougher due to many new indie studios funded by former AAA developers. Competition for human resources and funding is fierce. People who believed it the game and ordered alpha - huge thank you, you will never be forgotten and when the game is resurrected, we will make it up to you, somehow. Thank you for understanding.Post job ad RSS	JobsResetSkill Artists Audio/Music Human Resources Level Designers Management Marketing Programmers Public Relations QA/Testers Sales Web/Other Paid Job?
