However, the county is also known for its stunning countryside.Surrey Wildlife Trust currently manages 82 sites, together covering almost 8,000ha, which is 5% of the land area of the county. We also work with many partners and other landowners to advise on land management for conservation, with particular emphasis on woodland, wetlands, and heathland.We work with schools, communities and volunteers across Surrey to inform and involve people actively in nature. Over 15,000 children and young people now benefit annually from a wide variety of outdoor learning courses and activities. Each year our enthusiastic volunteers contribute over 10,000 ‘people days’ to our work.About the opportunity:Do you have the ability to enthuse and encourage children and young people to engage with their local natural environment? If so, you could be just the person we need to join our education team.The main aim of the role is to promote awareness and enjoyment of the natural environment and to foster a lifelong connection with nature through teaching 4-19 year olds. The Education Officer will teach from early years through to the secondary school curriculum plus inspire at events, birthday parties and other outdoor and classroom activities.We are seeking a flexible, experienced and highly motivated individual who is passionate about natural history and outdoor learning. Some teaching experience is essential together with enthusiasm, imagination and a wish to enthuse the next generation.This role is full time during March to July and in September, then two days a week in August and through the winter.
