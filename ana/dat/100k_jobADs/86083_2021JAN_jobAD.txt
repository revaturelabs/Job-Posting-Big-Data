jobs at Bosch’ByNews Desk-August 6, 2019Aug 06, 2019: A global car market expected to slow this year and the continuing aftershocks of a sector-wide diesel cheating scandal will hit jobs at the world's biggest component supplier Bosch, its boss said Tuesday.“Of course, we have to react to falling demand,” chief executive Volkmar Denner told Munich-based daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung when asked about possible job cuts.Expected by analysts to contract this year, the global car market is developing “much more weakly than we still thought a year ago,” Denner said.“This isn't just a short-term dip that will quickly be recovered,” he added.Reduced demand for diesel-fuelled vehicles “is hitting us particularly hard,” said Denner.Customers in Germany and abroad have turned away from the fuel since Volkswagen's 2015 admission to cheating regulatory emissions tests on 11 million vehicles worldwide, while investigations have spread to other carmakers in Germany's flagship industry.Many potential buyers have been deterred by already-implemented or proposed bans for some diesels from city centres, as municipalities try to reduce levels of harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the air.Meanwhile manufacturers themselves are ramping up alternatives, like hybrid and battery-electric vehicles, to meet tough new EU carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions targets set to bite from next year.Bosch said in January lower diesel demand would force it to slash 600 jobs among its 15,000 employees in the field.Over the full year, the company expects revenue at the same level as 2018, when sales reached 77.9 billion euros, rather than the slight increase it had previously predicted.And “we won't be able to maintain the high level of profitability we had last year,” Denner said.The company said early this year it expected a profit margin of below six percent, rather than last year's seven percent.Competitor Continental, listed on the blue-chip DAX index, in July lowered its full-year financial objectives, blaming the weak global market.AFP/APPPosted on: 2019-08-06T13:17:00+05:0029320TAGS2015 admissionabroad haveAFP/APPaftershocksalready-implementedAnalystsARY newsat

according to the updated data of the central bank.The number of borrowers that would benefit from this rescheduling relief has risen to 1,631,257 with outstanding amount of Rs 2.528 billion, it said.Under its Rozgar scheme for protecting businesses and employees working with them from the impact of COVID-19, the central bank has so far approved Rs238.2 billion for 2,958 businesses.Meanwhile,

and employees and thereby support continued employment in this challenging environment, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has introduced a temporary refinance scheme for payment of wages and salaries to the workers and employees of the business concerns.This scheme was aimed at easing cash flow constraints of the employers and thereby avoid layoffs. In addition, the SBP had expanded the scope of existing refinancing facilities and introduced a scheme to support hospitals and medical centers to purchase equipment to detect, contain and treat COVID-19 patients besides, stimulating investment in new manufacturing plants and machinery, as well as modernization and expansion of existing projects.APPFinance Ministry issues clarification on Change in Public DebtJanuary 20, 2021: The Ministry of Finance has issued a clarification on the change in public debt.According to a statement, the change in the public debt under this government is due to a correction of the flawed economic policies of the previous regime, especially its overvalued exchange rate and excessive borrowing.Interest Expenses: The previous government resorted to short-term debt instruments without maintaining adequate cash buffers, and relied heavily on SBP borrowing. This short-term debt profile has resulted in high interest costs on past debt. The present government has had to pay Rs 5.7 trillion (47% of the increase) as interest on debts borrowed by the previous regimes.Currency Devaluation Impact: The previous government artificially maintained the exchange rate of the Rupee much above its market value. A large increase in public debt has resulted from the abrupt exchange rate depreciation, which was inevitable because the overvalued exchange rate triggered a balance of payment crisis. The only alternative was a default on external liabilities, which was obviously not an option. Public debt increased by Rs 3 trillion (25% of the increase) due to this currency devaluation.Financing of Primary Deficit: The unjustified tax cuts by the previous government coupled with the impact of subsequent economic slowdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in higher than estimated primary deficits. Rs 2.5 trillion (21% of the increase) was borrowed for financing of primary deficit during first 29 months of the present government.Cash Management: Rs 0.6 trillion (5% of the increase) was on account of increased cash balances of the Government to meet emergency requirements. The present government took the economically sound policy of not borrowing from the SBP and maintaining a cash buffer, which led to a one-off increase in debt. However, this increase in debt was offset by corresponding increase in the government’s liquid cash balances. Furthermore, Rs 0.3 trillion (approx. 2% of the increase) was due to difference between the face value (which is used for recording of debt) and the realized value (which is recorded as budgetary receipt) of government bonds issued during this period.To conclude, the increase in debt during the tenure of present government occurred mainly during FY19 as an unavoidable consequence of erroneous policies of the previous government. Had the previous government maintained a market-based exchange rate, a sustainable level of current account deficit, adequate cash buffers and a long-term domestic borrowing profile, the present government would not have had to make all these difficult adjustments and public debt burden would have been reduced on the back of fiscal consolidation efforts of the present government supported by aggressive control on expenses and growth in tax and non-tax revenues. However, as most of the major adjustments to fiscal and monetary policies have been made, Debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline over the next few years.Press ReleaseGold prices edge up on prospects of US fiscal...January 20, 2020 (MLN): Gold inched higher on Wednesday as the US Dollar remained on the backfoot amid prospects of a hefty fiscal relief package.
