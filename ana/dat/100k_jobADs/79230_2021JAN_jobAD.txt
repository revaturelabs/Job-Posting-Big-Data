I liked the layout and it was user friendly. I tried to use another job board, but it was not user friendly and was kind of a pain, whereas LawCrossing was easy to use to find jobs. I really liked it. I would certainly recommend this site and service to my colleagues.Stephen Kobza Tinley Park, IL+ Read More Success StoriesShare Your Success StoriesAll we do is research jobsOur team of researchers, programmers, and analysts find you jobs from over 50,000 career pages and other sourcesOur members get more interviews and jobs than people who use \"public job boards\"Your privacy is guaranteed.
