The position is onsite with flexible working hours and home office.What We DoWe make source control and DevOps tools for the Salesforce developer ecosystem. Salesforce devs build impressively complex applications without any kind of source control or CI.You probably know Salesforce as a CRM app, but almost every big company uses it as an app development platform. Entire companies are built on Salesforce: for example Groupon runs almost all of their backend on it. Ticketing for Dutch Railways is processed through a Salesforce backend. Lyft and Uber run all of their B2B business through it. Amazon, Google, Facebook and Twitter are all heavy Salesforce users.But tooling for Salesforce is stuck in the past. Setting up modern tools like Travis or GitHub is almost impossible, because normal scripts don't work with the proprietary platform and Salesforce has many quirks. That's where Blue Canvas comes in, and why many large Salesforce teams use us to fill that gap.Our market is growing fast as more companies embrace “low code” platforms like Salesforce. $13B was spent customizing Salesforce in 2017.‍What We're Looking ForWe’re looking for experienced full-stack engineers to take a principal role in our team in Berlin.
