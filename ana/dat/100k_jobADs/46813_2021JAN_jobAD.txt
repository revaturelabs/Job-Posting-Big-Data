This requires that you can talk effectively about yourself and your research and teaching, ask good questions to the faculty, administrators, and students that you will meet, and highlight how your particular knowledge and experiences set you apart from other candidates. Whether you are applying for a visiting assistant professor position or a tenure track faculty position at a college or university, it helps to be prepared for the types of questions you will be asked, and to understand what search committees are looking for.Beyond the initial interview, the campus visit can also give you insight into what you might negotiate for if you receive an offer after the interview. Ask the panelists about their experiences, and learn from the best practices they share from their own experiences.
