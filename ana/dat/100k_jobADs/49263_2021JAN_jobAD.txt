HayhurstCoschocton TribuneView CommentsOctober was National Disability Employment Awareness Month with the theme \"The Right Talent, Right Now.\"Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities provides services to help individuals find employment.There are 38 clients of the DD Board working with 26 different employers in the community.One program helps high school students with disabilities to transition from school to the workforce.COSHOCTON - Shikara Robbins wants to be treated like everyone else despite her disability and she feels she's found a workplace that feels the same way in the Coshocton Regional Medical Center.Robbins suffers from a traumatic brain injury that causes seizures and partial paralysis on her left side. She previously worked at Hopewell Industries, a workshop for those with developmental disabilities. However, Robbins reached the point where she felt she had gone as far as she could at Hopewell and needed different employment.There are others like Robbins who want to find gainful employment in the community and be a part of it outside of a workshop setting. The Coshocton County Board of Developmental Disabilities offers support in helping those like Robbins to find jobs. They also have a program assisting high school students in the transition from school to the workforce. The programs provide education, training and the ability to find opportunities.There are currently 38 clients of the DD Board working in outside jobs with 26 different employers. Two individuals are holding down two jobs and one, Jamie Hoy, owns his own business - Jamie's Custom Cutting.Finding her placeRobbins has worked as a dietary aide for the medical center for four years. On Mondays and Fridays she does floor stocking, making sure departments in the hospital have snacks if needed. On other days she helps to make food, load food trays and deliver the trays to patients' rooms. She also helps with cleaning and putting dishes away.\"I like the fact that I keep busy. I get to move around, see people and talk to people,\" she said.Outgrowing the workshop at Hopewell, Robbins wanted a job that would put her in the community and connected with new people. Hopewell did what it was designed to do for her, get her started in working and building social and job skills she could take elsewhere.\"I hit what I felt was the most Hopewell could help me with. I wound up feeling like I was too advanced to work there. I was more on par with the staff than the individuals,\" Robbins said. \"When I started there in 2011 that's what I needed, a little place to help get me going, help start me and help develop skills.\"Robbins appreciates the hospital gave her a chance and feels she has made the most of it. Some tasks like carrying boxes can be difficult because of the paralysis, but she works it out and knows she can always ask for help if needed. Her advice to any business hiring someone with a disability is to just hold them to the same standards as all other employees.\"I'm treated like the others and (they) have the same expectations of me as everyone else,\" Robbins said of her job.The right fit for allHollie Hendricks is a vocational rehabilitation counselor with Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities (OOD) who works with clients in seven counties. Her specific focus is Employment First, an initiative to help those with disabilities connected with county boards and doing sheltered work segregated from the community to be integrated into the community and find competitive employment. Someone like Robbins might be an example of that type of client.\"What we do is try to work with them, their skills and their disability to find an appropriate job fit in the community,\" Hendricks said. \"It's not just about a job. It's about giving somebody a purpose.\"People come in and out of the program, but Hendricks said her target caseload is about 60 individuals. She covers Coshocton, Licking, Muskingum, Guernsey, Harrison, Belmont and Noble counties. She has seven open cases in Coshocton now. Hendricks is usually in Coshocton twice a month, but can come more depending on need. Sometimes a phone call is fine, but she usually meets with clients in person.\"Primarily in my case load we help people a lot with job development and job coaching. That's helping people look for work, fill out resumes, interview and learning a job,\" Hendricks said. \"Most of individuals I work with have a cognitive disability, but sometimes they have physical disabilities that go with it.\"The program is voluntary and there's never a problem if someone finds it's not working for them and drops out.\"It's not just starting to look for a job on day one. We help them take steps to getting employment,\" Hendricks said. \"There's a lot of people who just need a little help applying, interviewing and learning the job.\"OOD also works with employers and seeks out possible job leads. For example, Fanatics in Frazeysburg is an employer who will give those with disabilities a chance. The Fuse Network part of Hopewell, RHDD and Knox New Hope Industries from Mount Vernon are three partners in Coshocton who work as job developers. Hendricks would give any job leads she has to those providers.\"They are the boots on the ground. They are the ones out in the community helping (clients) to interview, looking for job leads or developing jobs leads in person with employers,\" Hendricks said. \"It's very essential to have employers open to learning about the possibility of hiring somebody with disabilities. A lot of time they don't know what all it entails. The truth is an individual who works with us comes with a ton of support.\"Transition from school to workRachel Geary of Coshocton is another vocational rehabilitation counselor with OOD under the Ohio Transition Support Partnership. She has about 40 open cases right now, but can have up to 90. Geary works with career centers in Harrison, Belmont and Coshocton counties as well as Coshocton, Ridgewood and River View high schools. The program can extend through the college years. She also works with students who have of an Individualized Education Program.\"In rural counties especially, we're disadvantaged in the services provided to us. There's not as many services those with disabilities could go to in Coshocton County,\" Geary said on also serving the local high schools.One service offered is a summer youth program. The first year is Summer Youth Career Exploration where participants would go to different businesses in the community and learn what it takes to do certain jobs there. The second year is a Summer Youth Experience where they would learn employee expectations and interview skills while working five weeks for a local company.Geary also helps individuals find the job path or education best for them and what can be found in the area. If someone is interested in video game design, for example, working as a clerk in a video game store could be a foot in the door type position possible locally.\"We kind of scale it back if the jobs aren't there and find something at least related the individual might be happy with,\" Geary said.Geary said studies have shown working in the community for anyone with disabilities helps to decrease feelings of depression and anxiety. And for teenagers, it can maximize positive outcomes even more.\"It makes them feel more like part of the community as they should,\" she said. \"If someone has a job while in school, they're five times more likely to keep a job once they graduate.\"llhayhur@coshoctontribune.com@llhayhurst740-295-3417View CommentsStaff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best Reach LocalÂ© 2021 www.coshoctontribune.com.
