In it I found on 12 different pages the same scheme of three columns of text and a picture in the top left corner. The only part of this scheme that changed apart from the information is that the publisher changed the color of the colored text based on the section the article was in. Another way they made minor changes is that if the picture was smaller then the middle column would go to the top of the page instead of starting under the picture. Other than those two things the scheme remained identical on all 12 pages.I looked in another edition of the magazine and found the same scheme on 8 pages. The scheme seems to be used on every month pieces like upcoming movies, current events, etc while the rest of the magazine, which contains full blown articles have unique styling.by Cat - January 30, 2014Master PagesWell I glanced at three things. The Sun Star newspaper, a small 50 page book one of our professors published, and an international journal we receive. The book “On Dangerous Ice” I’d have to say no to using any master pages. Mostly pictures/maps with captions with no sense of uniformity. The Sun Star is like most newspapers. I’d say the heading graphics are the same and column widths with the only variation being if a picture is added or a new subject title. Lastly is the IMCoS (International Map Collector’s Society) Journal. I’d say this has three master pages (MP). MP1 for the table of content page. MP2 for the next two pages which has a colored column on the far left of the page with list of officers and on the right a letter from the chairman on one page and in the same sections on the second page of MP a letter from editor and in colored column subscription info. MP 3 is for everything afterwards that have subject headers at the top of each page starting a new subject, same number of columns on every page using them, and font alignment. All three MP have a line across the bottom to separate reading material from page number and the web link on every odd numbered page. At the top of all pages not having a subject title, they have a header. On the even pages it says IMCoS Journal WINTER 2013 and edition number and on the odd IMCoS and the story subject name.by kswichert - September 19, 2013 September 19, 2013Magazine Master PageI received my new Country Living magazine in the mail today. After looking through it several times I counted 7 master pages. Five of these were different layouts of text and photos. On a two page spread (facing pages) One large photo on the right overlaps the left page which also has a corresponding photo with a two column text above it. The large photo also as text below it.by dkqueen - September 16, 2012 November 1, 2012Job 2: Dwell MagazineDebby Queen, September 16For this assignment I used the October 2012 issue of Dwell Magazine. I was able to identify 11 pages that appeared to be master pages within this issue; however, as a subscriber I also recognized many pages that, although they appeared in this issue only once, looked to be master pages that appeared in earlier issues. I pulled out the December/January 2012 issue and immediately noticed that the cover pages on the two issues shared the same formatting and were most likely derived from the same master page. After going through both issues I found what I believe were 18 master pages, and am certain that if I were to look more closely this number would increase. I was very impressed that each month the magazine I receive looks new and fresh, and yet the consistency that results from the master pages creates a sense of familiarity that I appreciate.The master page that was the most simplistic and yet visually appealing to me was from a featured article in the October 2012 issue called “Backstory”. The article consisted of 4 1-page spreads that had a large graphic that covered the top 80% of the page with a bold stroke surrounding it. The lower 20% of the page had three columns of text. The text and graphic were divided by a narrow stroke that spanned the width of the page. The bottom, inside corner of each page had the magazine title; the bottom, outside corner had the page number and the issue date. The upper, outside corner had the word “Backstory” on it.I found this exercise fascinating in that it showed how pages created using the same master page can look very different with only a few changes, and also how master pages can be used to create an identity for a publication.by ddwebb - September 16, 2012Job 2 – “Outside in the Interior”I picked “Outside in the Interior’ off my shelf, “An Adventure Guide for Central Alaska’ by Kyle Joly, a book that lists “more than 50 hikes, bikes, skis, strolls, and floats for all levels of outdoor enthusiasts.’ The main part of the book is divided into sections for each region within Interior Alaska, and within each region there are short subsections describing each individual hike or float. I found seven master pages:1. table of contents2. the first page of each author’s note, acknowledgements and introduction3. the title page of a new region, and4. its opposing page, a map of the region5. the first page of each new hike6. the first page of each of the three appendices7. IndexSome of these master pages seem to be based on other master pages or have at least common elements, for example the first page of at least two of the appendices clearly have shared elements with the first page of each new hike. A very easy to spot master page was the title page for each of the six regions covered in the book: there is a green band with a bleed filling the top fifth of the page. Within this band the name of the region is printed in a bold white font. The remainder of the page contains a brief description of the region in a comparatively narrow text frame, black font on white background. – I found this task more difficult than I anticipated, it is a whole new way of looking at a page and noticing things I would usually overlook!by Haley - September 15, 2012 September 15, 2012Job 02 – National GeographicI chose to use a National Geographic that I’ve had floating around my desk for a week, the September 2012 issue (for those following along…) I found several pages that could be from master pages in just the first 30 pages. This one seems to be the most prolific:On pages 7, 7b (not sure what to call it, it’s an ad “between” pages 6 and 8), 15, 23, 29 and 30 the pages all seem different in many ways yet considerably similar. These ads all have an image in the background with the majority of the product or service’s description and contact information laid out at the bottom of the page. Five of them have a caption at the top or in the middle of the space above the description.I counted at least 12 master pages but at about 150 pages, I am sure there are many more that I missed. I can’t imagine the people who create this magazine not tweaking some page elements to suit their purpose, thereby making master pages more difficult to spot. I guess that’s because that is what I would do.Haleyby lmpickard - September 13, 2012Master Pages Job 2I have taken several software classes over the last 2 years and have used the New Perspectives line of textbook for most of those classes (Word, Power Point, Access, etc). They definitely use master pages throughout each book.I counted no less than 5 master pages used in these texts–and it is the same for each book:The first page of each chapter has text and graphics in the same places.The subsequent chapter pages (the meat of the chapter) use two styles that are similar, including the margins and columns but the graphic placement alters.The end of the chapters in the review sections are the same in each chapter.The index uses a master page.The glossary uses a master page.Every single page, regardless of section uses the same header/footer set up and likely is the “First” master page used, with the others a variation and based on the “First.”I always noticed that pages in publications (even in websites now), there is an accepted format style for just about everything. It makes sense, of course–if there wasn’t some kind of formatting applied to certain publications, the mess that would have to be navigated to get information would be horrific!by Ginny - September 12, 2012 November 1, 2012Job 02Field Guide to North American WildflowersFor Job 02 I looked at a National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Wildflowers. I noticed four master pages; introduction pages, photo pages, body text and the index. The book also contains a glossary but it appears the body text master was used and over-ridden for the purpose. The book is small, 4″ x 7.5″. The first half contains full color, glossy pages with two or three photos of flowers vertically stacked on each page (two masters). These pages are not numbered but below each photo is a one line text frame identifying the flower by a unique number and it’s name. The frame also includes a page number that references a body text page containing more information (it will be interesting to learn the trick to this, keeping a photo and it’s page reference accurate while laying out a book..same with a table of contents and index I guess). The text frames contain black fill and white text (I made a note to myself to remember this nice effect for a full color page). The text and graphic frames all are set beyond the bleed (correct way to say this?) which maximizes the space for photo detail (no white space on the pages). The picture included here is of a body text page, I really like the layout. Thanks, Ginny (p.s. I’m sorry about all the white space on my post, I had trouble getting the text to wrap around the photo…any tips? Updated by cutting the line of code referencing the photo from below the body text to above it)MetaLog inEntries feedComments feedWordPress.orgGraphic Design Resources2Advanced Design FirmAdobe TV InDesign TutorialsAll About Logos and Brand IdentitiesCargo Collective – community of super creative people!ColourLovers – an excellent source of color sschemes and patters.Company FoldersFfffound – images, images, images!Graphic software for student pricesGreat typography blogIssuu – a great collection of magazines and other publications onlineKerning GameLinda – free tutorials on InDesign cs5Prepress tips for graphic designers articlePrint MagazineSmashing MagazineThe Supermarket – another design community; large amount of unusual, cool projects.Top ten problems in file prep for printUrban Fonts – good collection of free fonts.What is Print?Wordit – cool cool graphic design project; you can find a lot of inspiration or take part in it yourself.Free and Shared Image Resourceshttps://sxc.huhttps://stockvault.nethttps://everystockphoto.comhtp://wikimediacommons.orghttps://imageafter.comhttps://www.cgtextures.comhttps://lostandtaken.comProudly powered by WordPress | Theme: Blaskan by Colorlib.com."
