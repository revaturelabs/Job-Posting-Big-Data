The Problem of Pain—Pain is often the thing that brings us to the end of ourselves and drives us to Christ.2. Not By A Bare Permission—Your present suffering God will use for his glory and your good if you trust in him, although you may never be freed from your suffering in this life.3. God’s Solution to the Problem—Jesus Christ came to suffer so that you would not have to endure eternal suffering.CLICK HERE TO LISTEN to “The Book of Job and the Problem of Evil” (Job 1:12)Share this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...RelatedPosted on January 23, 2017 at 9:03 pm in Apologetics, Job, Podcast, Problem of Evil, Sermon, Theodicy, Troutman, Joe	| RSS feed | Reply	| Trackback URL	Tags: Apologetics, Expository Preaching, Job, OPC, Problem of Evil, Reformed Theology, TheodicyLeave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
