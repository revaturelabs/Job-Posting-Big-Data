In January, Jobs announced that he would be taking a leave of absence for an unspecified length of time due to health-related issues.The CEO had taken two similar leaves since 2004 to undergo treatment for pancreatic cancer, leaving other key executives in charge of day-to-day operations in his absence.Share This:About BlogvasionLabels: Apple, Business, News, Steve JobsNewer Post Older Post HomeAuthor DetailsPopular ReadsBest MacBook For Engineering Students 2019 GuideHow to Use a MacBook for Technical Engineer Work Don't you think you working on a mac is easy and looks stylish?
