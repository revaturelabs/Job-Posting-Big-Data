It is the first in a series of such events to provide a forum for the sector’s key manpower issues.Speaking at the webinar, Mr Ravi Menon, MAS managing director of MAS and IBM chairman, said the financial sector is planning to offer 1,800 newly created jobs and 2,000 traineeships.While the jobs are spread over different functions, the largest hiring demand is in technology, with 880 jobs.The local supply of such jobs is quite limited and as such Singapore needs to create a pipeline of locals for these advanced technology roles, said Mr Menon.MAS will roll out a new Work-Study Support Programme (WSSP) to develop job-ready graduates and build a Singaporean talent pipeline for the sector.The scheme will fund 80 per cent of the internship stipend, capped at $1,000 per month, for Singaporean undergraduates who serve their internships at financial institutions as part of the SkillsFuture Work-Study Degree Programme (WSDeg), which enables students to gain meaningful work experience and acquire work-relevant skills.The financial services sector has been a major participant of the WSDeg programme since its introduction in 2017, and the WSSP will help scale the programme in strategic growth areas, said MAS.MAS will also extend the Training Allowance Grant (TAG) for company-sponsored trainees by six months from Dec 31 to June 30 next year. IBF will also extend its 5 per cent additional course fee credit to cover the period. The scheme aims at boosting job retention through upskilling workers amid changing tasks and roles.TAG will keep up the training momentum of in-demand skills, such as technology, and in new growth areas, such as green finance, said MAS.READ it now!Wirecard’s great collapse could hurt consumer…	Oct 1, 2020High alert over spike of coronavirus infections in Europe	Aug 26, 2020Since TAG and related measures were introduced on April 8 this year to help financial institutions and fintech firms retain staff and build longer term capabilities, there has been a 65 per cent year-on-year increase in training participation, it added.MAS urged employers to continue to tap on the enhanced training support measures to equip locals with skills to enhance their employability in the sector.Mr Menon said creating jobs has become the central economic challenge, and jobs have also moved to the front and centre of MAS’s financial development agenda.More on this topicThe content of the article:1 More on this topic2 More on this topic“The success of economic policy is not measured by how financial markets are doing, not by how well companies are making new products, not even by how fast GDP (gross domestic products) is growing. The ultimate measure is this – Are we creating enough good jobs for our people?” said Mr Menon.In Singapore, the government has always been conscious that creating good jobs is of paramount importance. That is why in every downturn the focus of government support has been on sustaining jobs, keeping Singaporeans employed, he added.Mr Menon also said the Growing Timber series is part of MAS’s attempt to broaden and deepen its partnership with the financial industry and professionals so as to strengthen the Singaporean core in financial services.“Together we can transform the Singaporean workforce into the best globally,” he said.More on this topicSourceEMPLOYMENTFINANCIAL SERVICESMASSKILLS TRAINING	0	Share FacebookTwitterGoogle+ReddItWhatsAppPinterestEmailPrev Post	Vaccinating a nation: Can Biden manage America’s biggest health project?Next Post‘Guilt gifting’ is a thing in 2020 as we try to make up for a rough yearYou might also like More from authorBusinessBudget 2021 expected to be more targeted as Government dials down financial support	BusinessRecord number of firms flagged on MAS Investor Alert List last year	BusinessLucasfilm to sell Sandcrawler building in Singapore for $175 million to US firm	BusinessSGX tightens auditing of listed companies, raises property valuation standards	Prev	NextLeave A ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.Recent Posts	EntertainmentNaya Rivera: Big Sean pays moving tribute to Glee star and ex-fiancee	admin	 Jul 19, 2020 0	Southampton v Leicester: Saints boss apologises after historic 9-0…	Oct 27, 2019Giant swarm of flying ants spotted from space over UK	Jul 18, 2020Schools in England to benefit from 10-year government rebuilding…	Jun 29, 2020Boris Johnson to ‘keep asking’ for election – even…	Oct 27, 2019Special report: What’s really happening in the Arctic and…	Aug 18, 2020‘Guided by the best science’: FDA officials pledge to not…	Sep 10, 2020Sustainable cities for a sustainable Japan	Jan 12, 2021Ex-Treasury mandarin Kingman to chair Tesco Bank	Oct 6, 2019A maritime mystery: What has been causing ships to sail in circles?
