The top reason they are hiring more people, according to the survey, is that they are expanding their product and service offerings.“Hiring in this hot market is not for the faint of heart, and employers need to ensure they create a strong positive culture, provide clear advancement paths and offer competitive benefits to win the war for talent,” said Michael Mitchel, Korn Ferry area leader for Colorado. Korn Ferry has increased its presence in the region to meet growing demand for recruitment professionals.When asked what job was hardest to fill, the top response was technology/digital roles.“There’s no doubt there’s a shortage of tech workers as more technology companies move to the region, but there is a need for qualified talent across virtually all sectors and roles,” said Mitchel. “The most successful companies we work with have a long-term strategy to attract, hire and retain employees to meet the evolving demands of their business.”Compared to 3 years ago, how difficult is it to find qualified talent in the Front Range region?Much more difficult 23 percentSomewhat more difficult 45 percentAbout the same 21 percentSomewhat less difficult 8 percentMuch less difficult 3 percentCompared to 3 years ago, how is the caliber of candidates?Much better 8 percentSomewhat better 30 percentAbout the same 49 percentSomewhat inferior 13 percentSignificantly inferior 0 percentHow much is a shortage of qualified talent affecting your business growth?Severely limiting growth 8 percentSomewhat limiting growth 53 percentNot impacting growth 39 percentCompared to this year, what are your hiring plans for next year?Hiring significantly more people 8 percentHiring somewhat more people next year 40 percentSame amount of hires as this year 39 percentSomewhat fewer hires than this year 10 percentHiring significantly fewer hires next year 3 percentIf you are hiring more people next year, what is the top reason?Meeting demands of growing economy in Front Range 15 percentExpanding products/services 60 percentTurnover 19 percentWe are new to Front Range area 6 percentIf you are hiring fewer people next year, what is the top reason?Downsizing 21 percentChange in business model 43 percentTechnology is automating tasks 0 percentHired enough recently 36 percentWhat type of talent hires are the most difficult to find?Sales 11 percentTech/digital 31 percentR&D 8 percentManufacturing 5 percentFinance 11 percentMarketing 4 percentHR 3 percentHourly roles (e.g. drivers) 9 percentOther 18 percentWhat level is most difficult to hire for?Senior executive/C-suite 13 percentVice president 16 percentDirector 23 percentLine Managers 23 percentHourly workers 25 percentAbout Korn FerryKorn Ferry is a global organizational consulting firm.
