The actual cost of using your local servicing providers may be outside of the estimated range. We provide estimates on servicing costs for information only and accept no liability for any inaccuracies or errors. If you think an estimate is incorrect, please contact us to let us know.What car services do Clickmechanic offer?We offer three different types of service in Glasgow: interim service, full service and major service.The most popular car service booking in Glasgow is a Major service for Hyundai, Honda, and Mitsubishi.What is the difference between the different types of service?The main difference between the car services offered in Glasgow is the number of checks performed.The Interim Service is a lighter variation of a Full Car Service. When booking an Interim Service in Glasgow, your car undergoes many of the checks carried out during a Full Service. As mentioned this is a lighter version, and therefore does not include much of the more detailed inspections like checks on the auxiliary drive belt, battery level and air filter checks.Our Full Car Service is a series of comprehensive tests on both the inside and outside of the car. It includes fluid checks as well as oil changes. The Glasgow mechanic performing the full service will also run an extensive investigation of what is going on under the bonnet.If you book our Major Car Service in Glasgow, your car will undergo all the checks of the Full Car Service, and in addition the mechanic will replace your pollen filter and spark plugs (if a petrol engine). We recommend a Major Car Service at least every two years, however many vehicles will need a full service more frequently.What happens during a car service?If you have a car service in Glasgow booked via the ClickMechanic platform, a vetted mechanic servicing Glasgow will inspect the car. Depending on the type of car service booked (interim, full or major service) he will spend up to 2 hours inspecting your vehicle and replacing filters and fluids (subject to service type booked)You can have your car serviced at a location of your choice in Glasgow, for example on your drive or the car park at your place of work. As we work with mobile mechanics who come to you, there is no need to drop your car off at a garage.I have booked a car service in Glasgow - do I have to be present?No, there is no need for you to be present during the service so you can go on with your day. Once the mechanic has completed the service, they will sign or stamp the service book.Book a trusted mechanic todayGet an instant quote, then book a vetted mechanic to fix your car at your home or office.Get startedVetted mechanicsSave up to 50%Fast online bookingMechanics in and around Glasgow786 Auto Repairs Ltd, GlasgowAllcar Garage, Glasgow,Auto Solutions Ek Ltd, East KilbrideBishopbriggs Mot Centre, GlasgowBraehead Mot Centre, GlasgowBuchanans Garage Services, KilmarnockBurnett Motor Services, GlasgowCairney's Auto Solutions Limited, North LanarkshireCar Clinic Glasgow Ltd, GlasgowDrm Mechanical And Car Sales, KilsythEhsan Motors, GlasgowGmc Car And Commercial Repairs, PaisleyKp Autos Ltd, GlasgowMastermechanics, GlasgowMjd Automotive, GlasgowMobile Auto Assist, MotherwellMsr Scotland, SouthlanarkshireMvr Scotland, GlasgowNorth Road Autos, BellshillPD Automotive, DumbartonRM AUTOS, GlasgowRepayr My Car, AyrRoadrunner Mot And Service Centre, CarlukeSaltire Tyres, East KilbrideTm Mechanical Services, GlasgowTradeston Performance, GlasgowUHO LTD T/A GLASGOW MOTORS, GlasgowWalker Autocare, Glasgow12Recent Car Service quotes in GlasgowThese recent quotes were taken from our quote engine which uses third-party industry standard data on repair times, along with a live parts retailer, and a regional labour rate to build an accurate free quote.

In addition, we ask all customers to review their mechanic so we can remove any unprofessional mechanics from the network and ensure that the standard remains high.We have a dedicated customer service team based in London to assist you and ensure your booking goes smoothly.2Who are the mechanics?The mechanics are a nationwide network of independent garages and mobile mechanics. We rigorously vet the mechanics before they join the network to ensure they have:At least 5 years work experience (average is 20 years)At least City & Guilds level 2 mechanic qualification (or better)Public liability & trade insuranceFurthermore, our users rate the mechanic after each job, meaning we quickly remove any unprofessional mechanics from the network.3Is there a warranty for your services?Yes. All repairs & services come with a 12-month warranty on both labour and parts. If there’s any defects in the workmanship we’ll work with you to get it resolved at no extra cost.4Do I pay more for the mechanic to come to me?In almost all cases, no. Collection & delivery is included in your quote. If your car isn’t drivable, and the work can’t be done by a mobile mechanic then some garages will charge a recovery fee. If this is the case, our customer service team will be in touch to let you know in advance, and you’re under no obligation to accept the increased price.5Is there a cancellation fee?You can cancel your booking with no fee up to 24 hours before the booking. If you cancel within 24 hours of the scheduled visit, then you’ll be charged a £20 fee, which will increase to £40 if the mechanic has started travelling to your location.6Can I supply my own parts?No. We don't offer a labour only service where you provide your own parts. This is because all mechanics operating in the network must offer a 12-month warranty on their repairs, and so must be able to guarantee the quality and suitability of all parts supplied.Booking1I'm not sure what's wrong, what should I do?If you don’t know what’s wrong, we recommend booking a diagnostic inspection and we’ll send a mechanic to find and fix your fault.2When can I book in for?You can book in 7 days a week, 8AM-8PM. We ask for a day's notice when making a booking, so that we can connect you with a mechanic and they can source the parts.3I can't find my repair, help!No problem! Please email us at support@clickmechanic.com with your repair details, registration and postcode and we'll send you a tailored quote.4When do I pay?You will be charged only when the mechanic has completed the work to your satisfaction, and you've given the go-ahead to invoice.5Why do you need my card details?Much like a hotel, we need your card details to reserve your booking and guarantee payment for the mechanic. You won't be charged a penny until the mechanic has completed the work to your satisfaction and you've given the go-ahead to invoice.On the day1What happens on the day?On the day the mechanic will call you to let you know exactly when they will arrive. Then they'll introduce themselves and either take your car to the garage or get on with the work you've booked.Once the work has been finished, your mechanic will explain the work they've carried out. Once you're happy and give the go-ahead to invoice, then you'll be charged by the mechanic through the ClickMechanic app and your receipt will be emailed directly to you.2Will I get a mobile mechanic or a garage?For most jobs, we'll send them to both mobile mechanics and independent garages. For jobs that can't be done at the roadside, we'll connect you to a garage, and if your car isn't drivable then we'll connect you with a mobile mechanic.3Do I need to be present for a pre-purchase inspection?No, though the mechanic will need to be able to access the car, so it’s best to liaise with the seller to ensure that they will be available.4What if the mechanic finds I need a different repair?If your mechanic attends the booking and finds that the work requested is not the correct diagnosis, the mechanic will assess the vehicle to identify the correct issue. He will then charge the booking at the cost of a diagnostic inspection and you will receive an email receipt reflecting this. If the mechanic can help with repairing the vehicle, they will also send through an additional work quote for the correct repair.5Can the mechanic do the repair by the roadside?Most repairs can be done by the mobile mechanics on our network. Some jobs will require a workshop, and if this is the case we’ll find you a garage who will collect & return your car - so there’s no need for a trip to the garage.Didn't find what you need?
