The quartz.xml file contains settings that configure how and when these jobs run. It is located in the batch/ep-batch/src/main/resources/spring/scheduling directory.Some of these jobs can be configured to run at different intervals or to clear different amounts of data. For more information on how to do this, see Configuring System Settings.Batch Server Quartz JobsThe Elastic Path Quartz Jobs page contains a list of the Batch server’s quartz jobs.Computing Product RecommendationsA trigger is declared for computing product recommendation data. A SimpleTriggerBean is typically used to compute recommendations every 30 seconds for demonstration purposes. For production, use a CronTriggerBean to compute recommendations with a longer interval (for example, an interval of 24 hours).noteRunning the product recommendations job frequently on a large catalog with many orders can have a negative impact on performance. In a busy production environment, it is recommended that you schedule it to run at intervals of one hour (3600000 milliseconds) or more.Computing Top SellersA trigger is declared for computing the top selling product statistics. A SimpleTriggerBean is typically used to compute recommendations every 30 seconds for demonstration purposes. For production, use a CronTriggerBean to compute recommendations with a longer interval (for example, an interval of 24 hours).noteRunning the top sellers job frequently on a large catalog with many orders can have a negative impact on performance.
