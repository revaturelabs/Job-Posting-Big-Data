God inspired David to write this beautiful song that so marvelously describes the relationship between a faithful shepherd and his beloved sheep.David, a mighty warrior and successful king, grew up as a shepherd boy in the pastures of a family farm near Bethlehem. He knew well how that sheep demanded a keen, tender, firm and brave shepherd to guide and guard them. David spoke personally in this Psalm, yet he also spoke prophetically, as he looked forward to the greatest of all shepherds, the Lord Jesus Christ!The role of the sheep in this passage is very simple. The are to hear and heed the voice of the Shepherd. He does everything else. He leads them in the right way. He chooses their paths for them. He insures that those paths are ones that the sheep can walk in safety. He doesn't send them along the journey alone, but goes before them. He locates the green pastures and the calm waters necessary for life, and lovingly leads them to His provision. The sheep have no need of planning; no decisions to make; no anxious thoughts of failure. They have absolutely nothing to do but to trust themselves entirely to the care and compassion of the Shepherd, and to follow Him wherever he leads. Isn't it all very simple? You see, friend, there is nothing complicated about obeying completely the One Who is eternally trustworthy; and neither is there anything complicated in obeying with perfect confidence the glorious Shepherd who promises to each one of us an experience of abundant life!â€‹No wonder David could say, \"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\" Is He your shepherd?TO GET THE WEDNESDAY'S WORD DELIVERED STRAIGHT TO YOUR INBOX USE THE ENVELOPE TO THE LEFT.Visit Pulpit Truth0 CommentsLeave a Reply.Charles SmithHas agreed to allow Job2ten to pass along some of his words of wisdom.
