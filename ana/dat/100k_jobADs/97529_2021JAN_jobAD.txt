Many children who have CHIP and Medicaid coverage have one or two parents who work. In most states, children under age 19 with family income up to $48,600 per year (for a family of four) may qualify for Medicaid or CHIP, although the family income eligibility can vary depending on the state in which you live. In many states, family income can be even higher and children can still qualify.
