Automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are among the most disruptive forces descending upon the workplace, says the Gallup report, and 37% of Millennials “are at high risk of having their job replaced by automation, compared with 32% of those in the two older generations.”The discrepancy is because it’s more likely that older, more experienced workers are generally the ones holding leadership and management positions, or jobs that require discretion and more complex problem solving, says Glassdoor.com’s Scott Dobroski. It’s easier to replace workers early in their careers because they haven’t accumulated as many job skills and the work is simple enough for AI or automation to take over. And it’s not just the jobs you’d think – it affects nearly every role in any industry sector.Gallery: Top Technology Trends For 201710 imagesView gallery“It is not a big surprise to see or hear that many jobs for young people now could be and will be replaced by automation or AI over the next decade if not several decades,” Dobroski said. “All companies, whether technology, healthcare, consulting, retail, are essentially technology companies of some sort right now. What I mean by that is they all have an online presence, a web presence, mobile apps and so on.”The smartest thing workers can do to not get swept under the wave that will surely overtake most industries? If you’re considering a career move, get a beat on what jobs are trending up (software engineer) and which ones are on their way out (reporter). You can boost your skills through a boot camp or with a traditional degree, no matter what your industry is, but know that some companies may prefer a regular degree over a boot-camp certificate or DIY learning.“The bottom line is that Millennials have 40 or even 50 working years ahead, especially since most aren’t on a plan to retire,” said Jason Dorsey, president and Millennials researcher at The Center for Generational Kinetics. “This gives AI advancements more time to disrupt or replace Millennials in the workforce. On the other hand, the jobs at risk of being replaced by AI are not just the entry-level jobs that people typically assume, but rather the repetitive white collar jobs such as in accounting and financial services. The result is that Millennials more than any other generation in today’s workforce are at direct risk of having their careers forever altered by AI. One great irony of this situation is that many of the companies leading the charge to implement AI have Millennials in senior leadership roles. So if you can’t be the software, then you might as well be part owner.”Besides entrepreneurship, Dorsey also suggests being adaptable and open to training. “Be the Millennial that thinks about how AI can impact their industry, and find the jobs within the industry that would be hardest to replace through technology. In general, jobs that have the least amount of repetition are often the hardest to replace.”Mark Skwarek, a digital artist and lecturer at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering, which houses one of the country’s top AI research labs, calls the forecast “scary” but inevitable. “Certain areas will definitely take a hard hit. If you are in technology, be aware of the industry. You will see it coming if you are watching. At the same time, we live in reality and as the game changes we need to adapt,” he said. “Use the AI and automation to your advantage. I do, and take on much, much bigger projects than I would have a few years ago. I can do the work of a small group of people by myself. If employers hire the same number of people, think of the projects they could achieve.”Amanda Koster is a Seattle Gen Xer who started her career as a photojournalist, and then evolved it into many other iterations, including multimedia producer and, most recently, senior content producer at Amazon re-imagining the future of e-books. She said that in her latest round of job searching, she saw one thing come up over and over again: Coding. It was inescapable. Koster realized she needed to keep up or be left behind. “The lines between anything visual – content, web, design and code – are starting to blur, and I thought I would get ahead of the game,” she said. Also, to her great delight, she found that coding was actually fun, and she's looking forward to where her new skills will take her.Though the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) says that programmer and coder jobs will decline 8% due to outsourcing to other countries from 2014 to 2024, there will still be plenty of work, and in many cases, it will be too unwieldily to move massive operations overseas. “The software publishers industry is also expected to grow as the use of software offered over the Internet increases. This new use of software over the Internet should lower costs for firms and allow users more customization. In addition, new applications will have to be developed for mobile technology and the healthcare industry,” the BLS says in its report, adding that the median pay in 2016 for computer programmers was nearly $80,000 per year, or just over $38 per hour.What Jobs Are Safe?Dobroski says that jobs requiring critical thinking, strategy, data science, patients and “case by case scenarios” are less likely to be replaced. So software engineers, data scientists, doctors, nurses, lawyers and financial planners are relatively safe, but those jobs will still be informed by new technologies. “AI will help facilitate those jobs, make them more effective and faster but still, it's not like you're going to be having a robot at any point analyzing someone's broken knee and then fixing it on the spot, at least not in the next few decades,” Dobroski said.A recent article in the Harvard Business Review by Ravin Jesuthasan and John Boudreau says that AI will change organizational structures as we know them today. “The human work that is created or remains after automation will not fit easily into traditional jobs, nor will it always be optimally sourced through employment. Work will need to be freed from ‘jobs within organizations,’ and instead be measured and executed as more deconstructed units, engaged through many sources,” the authors write.How Employers Can HelpIt’s no secret that a calm and confident employee is a more productive one—and in order to streamline transitions, companies need prepare. Researchers say that it’s critical for managers to share plans for their AI implementation across the enterprise. “These leaders look beyond productivity and efficiency; they measure and address employees' emotional states. By understanding employees' needs and demonstrating how AI can assist employees, companies can improve employee engagement and amplify workers' performance.”In addition, companies need to do thorough assessments about their future-readiness. “These audits involve partnering closely with other business leaders to map out future job demands, AI adoption plans and the current state of the workforce in light of these changes,” Gallup says, using the example of a manufacturing company that’s doubled down on training to include data in all aspects of the work day and processes. “It equips its workers to incorporate data and analytics into their natural thoughts, feelings and behaviors. In doing so, this company prepares and equips workers for an AI-driven future, helping to enhance their engagement and performance,” Gallup says. Another Gallup study indicated that 59% of executives believe that data science and analysis will be just as important as communication skills.If you’re not worried about losing your job to AI and automation, you’re not alone. According to the Gallup report, about two-thirds of people aren’t. “We always say that Millennials this day and age should pursue careers in which they follow their passions, number one,” Dobroski said. “They may want to take on a job because they love it so much right now, but if all the signs say that's going to disappear in 20 years, they may want to decide to cross that bridge when they get to it.”Follow me on Twitter.
