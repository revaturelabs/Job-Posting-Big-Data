Some details below outlining each. I thought 1 thread covering all three would be a better bet for traction rather than a thread just for a single one of them. All three are in Early Access/Alpha states. Rollercoaster Tycoon World and Parkitect are available via Steam, while Planet Coaster is only available directly from the Developer for now.Planet CoasterPlanet Coaster is a Theme Park/Roller Coaster Construction and Management Simulation game, currently in development by Elite: Dangerous developers Frontier Developments. The game is available in Early Access at this time. Frontier were the studio behind Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, but have moved out to make their own.Here's the announcement trailer:and a 26-minute long 'first look' video with one of the producers:Roller Coaster Tycoon World\"RollerCoaster Tycoon World™ is the newest installment in the legendary RCT franchise. This next-generation theme park simulation and building game includes fan-favorite features as well as incredible new advancements!\"Parkitect\"Parkitect is a business simulation game that charges you with the construction and management of theme parks!Build the rides and manage the parks, and management is key.The parks need planning - more planning than just where to put that crazy rollercoaster!Lay down the infrastructure to remove trash and deliver supplies to the shops quickly and efficiently.

Does the game have alien models in it?I assume the majority of the models were custom designed/made from in-game assets. I would guess that the pitch black areas were made underground in the same fashion that a Star Wars one done a year or so ago. The encased areas really could be either. I would have loved to see a \"park\" level overview as well to see the size and scope of this 10 minute ride.Here is a video of how a lightspeed effect was created and it was done underground.Battle.net ID: bhchrist#1556\"A kid friendly version of the Kama Sutra.

Does anyone know a good starter guide to not spiral into bankruptcy?I have always found coasters to be cost inefficient (mostly because you need a lot of extras), use the other smaller thrill rides and the vendors to subsidize the coasters. Do not take out a loan for a coaster, it is fine to take them out for smaller rides and vendor areas (but try to avoid them altogether). Then again this may just be my play style.I actually disagree with this pretty strongly. Coasters are absolutely your big money makers, even a medium-small coaster will make a lot more money than the flat rides. The issue is that the startup costs are really, really high, and there is more to go wrong so that your coaster is actually performing at its potential. Because of that you absolutely have to start out with several flat rides and vendors to establish a foundation before you start creating a coaster, but once you have the coasters up and running they shouldn't be operating at a loss.It's really all about throughput, even a small coaster train will hold about as much people as the larger flat rides, and fresh coasters should be coming in more frequently than the run time of a flat ride. If either of those things aren't true then that's important to remedy. On a related note, it's important to look at the run time and occupancy of the flat rides, that's a great first order approximation of their profitability. The rides that only hold a few people for several minutes are not going to keep up with the others.Disclaimer: I haven't played since shortly before the Go-Kart update, I know that they have added several new flat rides since then, and it wouldn't surprise me if that means that there are some much more profitable flat rides available now.SteamBlizzard: Yonder#11589Quintin_StonePosted: January 10, 2018 10:01 PMPermalinkNot Without IncidentCary, NCChaz wrote:I want to know what this looks like from the outside and how it was made.

Does anyone know a good starter guide to not spiral into bankruptcy?Missed this. I've never referenced a starter guide but when I've played the key has been to avoid roller coasters and focus on getting money from adding the carnival thrill rides, I usually have six (with 3 mechanics) and a small vendor area before building my first roller coaster (which should be small).This is basically what I settled on. I had issues where I stagnated and reversed as soon as I tried to get past this point. Any extra rides I made would have hardly anyone walk to them even though they were cheap and new. So I could get a profitable park with about 6 rides, but I'm not having luck getting to the next stage.Battle.Net: Delbin#11365Life is a journey, time is a river, the door is a jar.LondonLooPosted: January 12, 2018 8:01 AMPermalinkOffice LinebackerLondon, UKDoes anyone have any recommendations for beginners guides to building custom buildings?I think my biggest issue so far is I'm lost with so many parts to choose from just to make a basic toilet or coffee shop!Or maybe I suck at architecture...Thanks in advanceomniPosted: January 12, 2018 9:10 AMPermalinkScotch EggScotland, UKI think what helped me was watching some of the Let's Plays on Youtube, just, don't get too disheartened by what they can build compared to what you come up withPeople Like Flabaliki, DeLadysigner, Skye Storme - maybe some of their older videos which tend to be timelapsed, which doesn't really let you see how they form shapes.Other than that, just go mad for a while. You could start a new park with everything unlocked and play about with the pieces. I haven't played in a long while, but back in Alpha I made these just by futzing around for a while:Nothing particularly spectacular, but the end result of even just 10-15 minutes of faffing can be quite pleasing, IMO.kergguzPosted: January 12, 2018 9:45 AMPermalinkZug ZugCymruAs Omni said, just messing about in sandbox mode is probably the best way to see what you can do. I even uploaded something to the workshop once, it's nothing special but TWO PEOPLE subscribed to it, which I was ridiculously proud of.

My son asked me to play Parkitect again, and they've updated the UI massively when it comes to coasters, done some optimizations, and building them is a little less stressful now. Essentially, they're making building rides more like Planet Coaster. This update is just a couple weeks old at this point, so it was a surprise to me for sure.If you haven't played it in quite a while, it might be worth hopping in to see the improvements.Edit: And just for a bit of hilarity since I necro'd the thread, the above Youtube link for the RCT Start Engine Campaign is currently at 143 likes and over 4,000 dislikes.GWJ Steam Key Master ListomniPosted: July 19, 2018 6:48 AMPermalinkScotch EggScotland, UKI haven't looked back into Parkitect since sticking 30 or so hours into it way back near the start of their alpha. I'm glad to see it's coming on with more time in the oven, it was already really charming as it was! Mod support, too, for people to add assets and themes etc - I just hope those keen enough on creating additional items haven't all burned out and moved on to other things. I'll probably just let it simmer until release, at this point, but will continue to read their Steam/tumblr updates to watch things progressRobearPosted: July 19, 2018 12:01 PMPermalinkMain GaucheHiding in between the secondsYeah, picked it up on sale as an investment in future fun.The two sides to every story are true and false, not yours and theirs.
