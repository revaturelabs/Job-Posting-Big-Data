The reasons for banning them are exactly the reason more and more parents are going to these agents instead of getting duped by domestic ones. The worst quote of all comes from the China Daily. \"A woman who is works for an unnamed domestic agency in Beijing gives this new law thumbs up because it will provide more transparency. The woman refused to give her name.\"Wt---?Hypocrisy anyone?It all comes down to racism, nationalism, and restricting investment in China.Back to topkungfumanJoined: 31 May 2012Posts: 1749Location: In My Own Private IdahoPosted: Wed Oct 31, 2012 1:39 pm Post subject:Hold on let me search this topic on Baidu because Google doesn't work too well lately...Back to topLarssonCrewJoined: 06 Jun 2009Posts: 1308Posted: Wed Oct 31, 2012 2:27 pm Post subject:When you say this do you mean international agents who open a school, or agents who assist students into studying overseas?I've been approached by four universities in Xi'an to set them up with 2+2 systems and also to help those current fourth years who wish to study masters abroad, because they were so unhappy with the services provided by domestic companies.Back to topSinamanJoined: 23 May 2009Posts: 85Posted: Wed Oct 31, 2012 2:50 pm Post subject:will it be policed as well as all the other crap they come up with?Back to topThe Great Wall of WhinerJoined: 29 Jan 2003Posts: 4946Location: BlabbingPosted: Fri Nov 02, 2012 5:08 am Post subject:http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-10/31/content_15858536.htmHorse's mouthNew regulations are likely to ban international agencies from providing education-exchange services in China, according to the Ministry of Education.A recently published draft regulation allows provincial-level educational authorities to approve or reject qualifications of intermediary agencies, bans foreign agencies entering the market and strengthens supervision of the agencies.Back to topGeminiTigerJoined: 15 Oct 2004Posts: 999Location: China, 2005--PresentPosted: Fri Nov 02, 2012 6:39 am Post subject:what do you expect from a country that brainwashes students from kindergarten through university with a so called \"philosophy\" course.Back to topwaxwingJoined: 29 Jun 2003Posts: 719Location: ChinaPosted: Fri Nov 02, 2012 11:25 pm Post subject:Just an idle thought, but I wonder if this is in breach of WTO agreements?

They also don't WANT their people believing western education is so vastly superior to their own. Chinese people are flocking to overseas education atm. I look at it from a different POV, ban foreign agencies from offering student exchange programs, then basically control who is allowed to go abroad, AKA rich, government party members.If I was a western school and got kicked out of recruiting, or being forced to go through a Chinese government operated intermediary, i'd just say fine....we're going to ban all Chinese nationals from attending our university. Of course......racism seems to always only go one way.......Back to topJavelin of RadianceJoined: 01 Jul 2009Posts: 1187Location: The WestPosted: Sat Nov 03, 2012 11:31 am Post subject:Ban Chinese nationals from our universities?

As far as I remember, Bush was a strong opponent to China's entry. I bet the former ambassador to China knew what he was talking about.Back to topJavelin of RadianceJoined: 01 Jul 2009Posts: 1187Location: The WestPosted: Sun Nov 04, 2012 2:42 am Post subject:And how did Chinese corrupt American unis? Did the Chinese cause the funding shortfall that these unis are experiencing? A funding shortfall that is being met by having those Chinese students pay double and triple local tuition fees?Back to topNon SequiturJoined: 23 May 2010Posts: 4724Location: ChinaPosted: Sun Nov 04, 2012 5:58 pm Post subject:Chinese education agents operating from my home country ie the education destination, have a bad reputation too.I wonder if there is a reciprocity thing available here? If I can't operate in China, why should Chinese operate here?On a parallel note, Chinese tour operators in my (destination) country were ripping off Chinese tour groups that the government stepped in and curtailed their activities.One example was posting a guard at hotel door to prevent tourists shopping at non approved stores ie those that were kicking back to the tour operators.PS Maybe this thread should be on 'non job-related'.Back to topDisplay posts from previous: All Posts1 Day7 Days2 Weeks1 Month3 Months6 Months1 Year Oldest FirstNewest FirstJob Discussion Forums Forum Index -> China (Job-related Posts Only) All times are GMTPage 1 of 1Jump to: Select a forum Where to Begin----------------General DiscussionNewbie ForumCurrent Events ForumTechnology ForumOnline Teaching Forum Africa Forums----------------General Africa Forum Asia Forums----------------CambodiaChina (Job-related Posts Only)China (Off-Topic)Hong KongIndiaIndonesiaJapanMalaysiaPhilippinesSingaporeTaiwanThailandGeneral Asia ForumVietnam Caribbean Forums----------------General Caribbean Forum Europe Forums----------------Czech RepublicFranceGermanyGreeceItalyMacedonia and the BalkansPolandRomaniaRussia & C.I.S.SpainTurkeyUkraineUnited KingdomGeneral Europe Forum Latin America Forums----------------ArgentinaBrazilChileColombiaCosta RicaMexicoMexico (off-topic)PeruGeneral Latin America Forum The Middle East Forums----------------BahrainEgyptIsraelKuwaitOmanQatarSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesGeneral Middle East Forum North America Forums----------------General North America Forum Oceania----------------Australia/New ZealandYou cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forumThis page is maintained by the one and only Dave Sperling.Contact Dave's ESL CafeCopyright © 2018 Dave Sperling.
