I've been following this message board for a while now. You've been of great help. I have been in TSU for Dulles since 5/22/09. Anyone out there in the same boat?My geo is Dulles as well. I am STILL waiting on my BI & MED to clear. I tested in dec 08 and received a T.O. in March 09. When did you test?There's a few of us on this forum waiting for Dulles. \"Amahastpl,\" recently went to FLETC for Dulles.

When I met with my BI he said he wouldn't go to my work because he knew they don't cooperate anyways (he had done others with people who have worked where I do) so he didn't see any point in ruffling feathers. He asked me for reference of people I work with and he met with those people at their home. Actually he only contacted 2 of the 3 I gave him too.So it's not a give in they will contact your employer depends on your BI investigator and where you work. At where I work ALL they will tell any one is that I work there and the dates I have been employed nothing more.CBPOTest: July 2008TO: 12/26/08VBT 1/21/09-passedMedical - 1/21/09 - cleared 4/28Fitness - 1/21/09 - passedDrug test - 2/5/09- passedBI - ClearedTSU -4/29/09 (Buffalo)BI2 - cleared 8/11ICE Special AgentTest 7/22/09 passedCommentPostCancelironwill727Forum MemberJoin Date: Sep 2008Posts: 111ShareTweet#1536408-05-2009, 10:01 AMMy BI came to my job while I was working to meet me. He interviewed my co-workers and boss at the time. Then he went to my neighborhood. The BI will interview as many people as possible even if you do not list them. So it is best not to hide anything.Of course this is all before my file got messed up and I have been going nowhere ever since.CommentPostCancelLamp LighterForum MemberJoin Date: Jul 2009Posts: 602ShareTweet#1536508-05-2009, 01:12 PMOriginally posted by CBPhOpeful View PostMy geo is Dulles as well.

He mentioned there are quite a few officers who are currently at the academy, but hopefully we see more hiring soon.I tested in November 08 at the OPM Building. I probably could have gotten into TSU sooner than I did if I hadn't had to reschedule my med/fitness on a count of the doctor having an personal emergency. My BI went pretty smoothly and quickly, most likely because I had a clearance with USCIS previously.I am hopeful for us. I have been more or less out of work since March and really would like to get things going.\"He made the night a little brighter where ever he would go.

Does anyone know how long it takes for you to find out your score, the lady on the phone said I will not get my results tomo.You might not get your official results tomorrow but the doctor can tell you if he/she passes you or not. FYI... they won't be able to tell you for 48 hours after you take it because you have to go back to get your TB test checked. I think for DHS to get the results and post them to CASS takes weeks, but I'm sure you're pretty used to the waiting by now anyways lol05/09 Written Test06/01/09 NOR07/15/09 T.O. & Quals (GS-5) Cleared08/04/09 Med. & PT-Passed08/07/09 BI-received08/11/09 Drug Screening Passed08/17/09 VBT PassedCommentPostCancelAlmostDoneForum MemberJoin Date: Oct 2008Posts: 48ShareTweet#1537308-06-2009, 05:55 PMWeek 6 at FLETC.
