Therefore if you apply to our job you must agree to go to any of our locations including Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown WV, Bidgeville, PA and possibly other locations within 50 miles from there. If you are applying with a friend, you must specify it, because otherwise I might separate you within different locations.Additional info:Only for the students from Russia and Eastern Europe. This employer has several fast food locations in Pittsburgh, PA and within 40 miles from there. Since the students will work with the clients of our fast food restaurant we need them to have GREAT ENGLISH level. No intermediate or upper-intermediate English will be accepted. We do not require the students to have special skills and work experiences, since we will be able to train our new staff. In fact the applicants with previous job experience on such positions as order takers, waiters and cookers will have more chances, because they will work with clients in public and the previous experience may be valuable. Great English is the main requirement though!
