But including HSBC’s 35,000 redundancies planned before coronavirus struck, the total is closer to 150,000.Here is a rundown of which UK firms have been hardest hit.Read more: MPs label British Airways a ‘national disgrace’ over job cutsBritish Airways – 12,000 jobsWhen British Airways bought Spanish airline Iberia in 2011, forming parent company IAG, it was in part to make the company more resilient to market shocks.But they did not anticipate a shock this big, or this long-lasting, with the vast majority of flights grounded for months, and little hope of things returning to normal any time soon.As a result, BA announced that it was holding consultations to cut 12,000 jobs, leading MPs to brand it a “national disgrace”.Virgin Atlantic – at least 3,000 jobsRichard Branson’s airline had spent much of the last year campaigning to be recognised as a “second flag carrier,” behind arch-rival BA. Now, the company is fighting for survival, cutting at least 3,000 jobs and pulling out of Gatwick Airport.Chief executive Shai Weiss said: “We have weathered many storms since our first flight 36 years ago but none has been as devastating as Covid-19 and the associated loss of life and livelihood for so many.”Virgin Atlantic is cutting more than one-third of its workforce	(AFP via Getty Images)Virgin Atlantic announced the return of flights to 17 destinations in June and called on the government to scrap its 14-day quarantine for inbound travellers.Read more: Virgin Atlantic to restart flights to 17 destinations in AugustEasyjet – 4,500 jobsEasyjet has been one of the strongest performers in UK aviation in recent years, but like it’s peers, it has had nowhere to fly for nearly three months. As a result, it is cutting about 30 per cent of its staff, equating to 4,500 jobs.Easyjet boss Johan Lundgren said: “We realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term.”Read more: Easyjet boss warns that more jobs could be lost due to quarantine plansRyanair – 3,000 jobsRyanair boss Michael O’Leary has a reputation for not mincing his words, and as he announced that he would be forced to cut 3,000 jobs, he complained that foreign airlines such as Lufthansa have had more support than Ryanair.“Air France and Lufthansa are subsidy junkies hoovering up state aid,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Ryanair employees who survive the round of cuts will be forced to take pay cuts as much as one-fifth of their salaries.Read more: Lufthansa shares slump as bailout battle approaches showdownRyanair boss Michael O’Leary has bemoaned the state aid given to competitors such as Lufthansa	(AFP via Getty Images)Read more: Ryanair set to cut up to 3,000 jobs due to coronavirusAer Lingus – 900 jobsThe Irish airline is also part of IAG, along with British Airways and Iberia. It has cut 900 jobs.

The job losses come on top of a previously announced round of 950 store management roles announced in July.Swissport – 4,175 jobsBaggage handler Swissport has been faced with much the same issues as the rest of the aviation industry, and it announced on 24 June that it would cut 4,175 jobs – about half of its workforce.“This is devastating news. At least 4,000 workers – and possibly many more – will lose jobs which are essential to regional economies,” GMB national officer Nadine Houghton said.“With Swissport now considering job cuts on this scale we have deep concerns about the viability of many of our regional airports and the benefits for regional connectivity that they bring.”Heathrow airport – at least 500 jobsThe UK’s main international airport saw passenger numbers drop to an all time low in May, down 97 per cent on normal levels.It has already cut about 500 managerial jobs, but has launched a voluntary redundancy scheme for the rest of its workforce. About one-third of its 7,000 strong workforce is at risk.John Holland Kaye, Heathrow CEO, told City A.M. last month that as many as 25,000 jobs could go at the airport unless the government relaxes quarantine rules to boost travel.Centrica – 5,000 jobsThe owner of British Gas has been hit hard by the pandemic, and is looking to cut nearly one-fifth of its workforce, or 5,000 jobs.More than half of these will be in management roles, with the company trying to slim down its operation and reduce bureaucracy.

It comes after the coronavirus dramatically reduced global demand for oil.In an email to staff, chief executive Bernard Looney said: “The oil price has plunged well below the level we need to turn a profit.“We are spending much, much more than we make – I am talking millions of dollars, every day.”BP blamed job cuts on plummeting oil prices	(AFP via Getty Images)Read more: Oil prices hit highest levels since early March as Opec+ pledges cut complianceAirbus – 1,700 UK job cutsEurope’s largest planemaker Airbus said that it will cut 1,700 jobs in the UK as part of 15,000 redundancies around the world.The UK’s Unite union said plans by Airbus to cut 1,700 jobs in Britain will affect its operations across the country, including at its two biggest factories.Unite said 1,116 manufacturing jobs would be lost, with Airbus’ largest UK factories in North Wales and Bristol to be affected, along with 611 office jobs.Bombardier – 600 UK job cutsManufacturing giant Bombardier today said it will cut 2,500 jobs in its aviation division as the coronavirus crisis sparks a slump in demand. Its Northern Ireland manufacturing plant will account for 600 UK job cuts.Rolls-Royce – 9,000 jobsThe jet engine maker has long been one of the jewels in the crown of British manufacturing. But that was not enough to stop it cutting 9,000 jobs, of which 3,000 will be in the UK.About 1,500 of these UK job cuts will be at its Derby headquarters, where it is partway through building a massive new engine manufacturing facility.Chief executive Warren East said: “This is not a crisis of our making.

However, it said this plan was “clearly derailed by the impact of the pandemic”.Aston Martin – 500 jobsSince its disastrous Initial Public Offering in 2018, Aston Martin has been struggling, and the coronavirus could not have come at a worse time.The firm is also looking to cut costs in other areas, including contractor numbers, marketing and travel, as it battles its way back to profitability.It comes months after Lawrence Stroll, the billionaire fashion tycoon, took over the firm in January.
