They ensure that vessels are constructed, equipped and maintained according to safety standards and are seaworthy. They check design plans, and make sure the construction of marine vessels complies with marine industry standards.Marine surveyors will also periodically perform inspections to make sure that acceptable standards are maintained throughout the ship's life. They may inspect passenger and cargo ships, cruise liners, high-speed ferries, small boats and crude oil carriers.Working conditionsMarine surveyors spend some of their time based in an office. They also spend considerable time outdoors in harbours or out at sea, in various weather conditions. They may be required to travel for work, and sometimes they need to base themselves at the location of the ship for the duration of their project.Marine surveyors may specialise in the examination of a particular aspect of a vessel such as marine mechanical equipment or the assessment of decks or hulls. With the appropriate training and accreditation, marine surveyors may work in multiple specialisations.Tools and technologiesMarine surveyors may use infrared thermography and multimeters to assess electrical wiring and damage on vessels, moisture meters to check leaks in hulls, waterproof flexible cameras to inspect fuel and water tanks, carbon monoxide detectors to check for exhaust problems, as well as cameras to document evidence. They must also regularly consult maritime standards and codes to establish the seaworthiness of vessels.How do I become one?Education and trainingTo become a marine surveyor, you need to study a qualification in marine surveying.The Diploma of Maritime Operations (Marine Surveying) is offered by the Australasian Institute of Marine Surveyors. This is the only course in marine surveying available in Australia.The course is delivered online. However, there are practical components that require access to a vessel between seven and 35 metres in length.Contact the Australasian Institute of Marine Surveyors for more information.Required registration and licensingTo work as a marine surveyor in Western Australia, you will need to apply for surveyor accreditation with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA).You may also be interested inMaster fisher Ships engineer Ships master Ships officerPage last updated November 30, 2020Back to topQuick clicksReview of Skills, Training and Workforce DevelopmentGet skills ready and job ready with free training, half price courses and more!Search for coursesFind your local Jobs and Skills CentreView our jobs boardAboriginal services jobs boardOut of Contract Register: Find an apprentice or traineeApprentice and Trainee Reengagement IncentiveContact usjobsandskillswa@dtwd.wa.gov.auFind your local Jobs and Skills CentreCall your nearest Jobs and Skills Centre 13 64 64Enquiries and feedbackWe welcome your enquiries and feedback.Use our online formLodge a formal complaintFor feedback or enquiries about this website:website@dtwd.wa.gov.auTwitterFacebookYouTubeThe Department of Training and Workforce Development acknowledges the Aboriginal peoples of Western Australia as traditional custodians of the lands and waters.
