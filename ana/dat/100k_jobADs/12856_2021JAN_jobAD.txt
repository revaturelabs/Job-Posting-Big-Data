In addition to that, there are even more red flags in which are dead in line with other scammy apps like Lucktastic.These are:Lucky DayLucky MoneyLucky GoLucktastic Red FlagsTakes years to earn any moneyPeople have literally been playing Lucktastic for 2-3 years and still haven’t managed to earn enough to cash out.I mean, that’s dedication and you’d think 2-3 years is a very long enough time to at least win SOMETHING.Need to download apps to cash outOne HUGE red flag is that when you have enough tokens to redeem for a gift card, they ask you to download a hell of a lot of apps first.And most of them no one even likes.Then when they’ve completed downloading, low and behold the gift cards are suddenly “out of stock”.What a complete and utter joke.Never any gift cards availableOne common tactic these scammers use is to make their app say “No gift cards available, come back another time”.So they’ll replace the current card with a more expensive card to make you keep playing.For example: If you get accumulate enough tokens for a $50 gift card, it will be replaced with $100.This is because they’re not actually giving anything away, they make it seem like they are so people continue playing.No customer serviceThere is literally no customer service.People are emailing them over and over again because they have questions about their winnings and concerns about how they’re operating things.And they never get a response back.This is because there is no customer service and I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s a one man show, making all this money off of advertising and not paying his members anything!No One Has Any ProofLiterally nowhere on the internet there is anyone coming forward claiming they’ve actually received their winnings into their bank account.Sure there are people with photos of checks but who’s to say those aren’t photoshopped?It doesn’t add much credibility when everyone’s calling it a scam.How the Owner Makes MoneyThe owner makes money with ads.Advertisers pay the owner to put ads on his app and that’s why there is an ad almost every second playing the games.The more ads he can get in front of people, the more money he makes.And that’s why I wholeheartedly believe he is not paying his members the money they are promised or gift cards that they’re trying to get.He wants all the money to himself while making people think they’re winning but really they’re only seeing numbers on their screen, not numbers in their bank account!Signing Up & LimitationsIt is free to download the app and you can begin playing right away.All that’s required is some quick details.They will also ask for your zip code so they can send you targeted ads.However, they only accept US citizens so if you’re not from that country you will have to look for another app.It’s a Scam, it’s as Simple as thatNo one is making millions of dollars, no one is making thousands of dollars, no one is making hundreds of dollars.In fact, no one is making a dime and that’s the cold hard truth.Out of the 15 million downloads, I have yet to see anyone come forward with proof that they’ve been paid their winnings.Lucktastic are just like all the other scams I mentioned in this article.They don’t pay, they have sh*t customer service, they don’t care about their members and they will say anything they can to make you think you’re doing the right thing by playing their app.I’m sorry to say but Lucktastic is a complete and utter SCAM!Making More Money Without Actually Being Scammed?Getting scammed sucks!I have been scammed multiple times and unfortunately for Lucktastic players, they have been scammed of their time which is the most important asset we have.I was scammed from my time and thousands of dollars from systems just like this one promising me quick and easy money.But you know what?Anything that promises rags to riches is a huge liar because no such systems exists and never will.There are no legit push button systems, no real get rich quick schemes and no way to win hundreds of dollars with apps like Lucktastic.Fortunately I did eventually find a system that taught me how to make REAL money online.The kind of money that I allowed me to quit my job and work from home.And I have Wealthy Affiliate to thank for that.Thanks for reading my review.
