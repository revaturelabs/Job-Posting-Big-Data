The period of employment is 3 years.The ambition of the current project “DIGICOAST – Next-Generation Coastal Modeling for Wave, Current and Sediment Transport Impact on Coastal Infrastructure” is to build the next generation of coastal numerical models. We aim at a holistic, consistent and realistic representation of the near-coast and the connected inland waterways. The primary objective of the project is to represent waves, current and sediment transport and their effect on coastal infrastructure and buildings in the vicinity of coastal urban areas. DIGICOAST is based on the open-source framework REEF3D, developed and used at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering by several research groups. Advanced high-performance numerical algorithms are combined with state-of-the-art supercomputer infrastructure to represent the coastal and river processes on large scales while maintaining all relevant details.This PhD position is a part of NTNU’s initiative to establish the “Center for Green Shift in the Built Environment” hosted by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. The Center’s vision is to create value in the society through Digitalisation. This center will utilize and develop expertise, methods, tools and strategies for a sustainable built environment. The research and innovation activities of the center will be directed at a Green Shift and a Digital Future.The position reports to the main supervisor.Duties of the positionAdvance modelling capabilities for near-shore waves, current and sediment transportContribute to the development of open-source softwarePublish in top-ranking journals and conferencesPerform excellent and independent research on topics attached to the positionsCollaborate with the project team from different research groups at the departmentRequired selection criteriaThe PhD-position's main objective is to qualify for work in research positions.
