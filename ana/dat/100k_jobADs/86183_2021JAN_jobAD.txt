Often one of the most innovative sectors for Research Scientists is Synthetic Biology, which has a wide range of applications as well as the potential to impact on society significantly. Examples of the applications are bio production, use of waste feedstocks for the manufacture of high value products, manipulation of virus or mammalian cells to be used within Viral Vector manufacture, and Cell & Gene Therapies.

New technologies such as CRISPR will transform the industry and are now becoming more commonplace, with so many applications yet to be explored and true impact to be measured.Research Scientists tend to have quite standard job titles – Junior Research Scientist, Senior Research Scientist, Lead Scientist, Principal Scientist and so on.Skills and Experience required to become a Research ScientistPhD or equivalent in a relevant fieldPost doctoral experience in a commercial environmentAutomation, statistics, design of experiments and/or programmingMultidisciplinary industrial environmentExcellent communication skillsAbility to use your own initiative to work autonomouslyKnowledge of GMLP / GLP or ISO StandardsInnovative, creative scientist who enjoys problem solvingSalary LevelsResearch Scientists can receive a wide range of salaries depending on their seniority and areas of expertise.
