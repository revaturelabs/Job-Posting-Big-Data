All external candidates will be interviewed over Zoom and we will not be conducting any face-to-face interviews in any of REA’s Australian offices – with no exceptions. The reasons for this are not only to protect the health and safety of our people, but also to assure candidates that there is no expectation from REA to meet face-to-face. A virtual interview will not adversely impact your application.
