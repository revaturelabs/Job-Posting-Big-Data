Analysts attribute this anemic growth to a talent shortage, which means businesses need to be savvier than ever in creating their talent-acquisition strategy to attract the field’s best and brightest.How to attract top IT talentAs demand for talent continues to rise, and supply remains tight, what’s an employer to do when seeking top-flight candidates in an increasingly crowded job market?Here are our top tips for bringing in the best talent the market has to offer.Learn what employees wantEngaged employees are happy employees — and heading into 2020, a hefty salary definitely isn’t enough to attract or retain engaged, happy employees.Compensation will always be a key factor for candidates — after all, ping-pong tables and nightly in-office happy hours don’t pay the bills — but other factors are quickly rising to the top of the best talent’s wish lists when seeking a new role.What benefits did your best employees ask for when they started? Do you know what the market is currently dictating?According to the Society for Human Resources Management’s Employee Benefits 2018 report, a whopping 72% of companies surveyed increased their benefits offerings in the previous 12 months to retain their best employees and snag top talent.Companies that increased their benefits focused on the following:A 2018 Justworks survey of employees discovered the employee benefits that candidates prioritized most when weighing the pros and cons of a job offer:Get cultural buy-in on every roleBefore the hiring process starts, every key player in your organization — from your top brass to direct managers and the HR department — should be in sync with a position’s requirements and duties.Organizational dissonance around the role of a new hire can lead to confusion and delays during the interview process or, worse, bad hires.It’s worth taking the time to solidify what you’re looking for in your top candidates and what they’ll be doing if they join you — even the best hire will sour quickly if they realize you weren’t clear on your expectations of them from the get-go.Prioritize continuing education through upskillingWhen talent shortages loom, businesses that have made big investments in developing a solid team need look no further than their existing workforce to meet their internal demands.Benjamin Franklin said it best:“An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.”Upskilling, the practice of educating current employees on new skill sets, is increasingly prevalent in the tech world — and is a way to more effectively leverage talent that’s already been vetted and hired.Investing in existing employees’ skills is one of the many ways to nurture and retain the talent you already have in place, an imperative when hiring new employees is harder than ever.Upskilled employees will be more prepared to shift gears within their existing roles to do more specialized work, take on new projects in areas of strategic opportunity, and excel in their careers within your company.
