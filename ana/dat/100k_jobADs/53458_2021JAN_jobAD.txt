The respiratory virus killed 4,002 Americans on Thursday alone, just under Wednesday’s record 24-hour toll of 4,008 deaths.Article SidebarShareShare this Story: U.S. wants faster vaccinations as pandemic worsens, job market suffersCopy LinkEmailFacebookTwitterRedditLinkedInTumblrTrendingAdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedThe latest surge has been compounded by the spread of a new, more infectious coronavirus variant first detected in the United Kingdom that has now been found in at least eight U.S. states, including California, Colorado, Florida and New York.Pennsylvania and Texas became the latest two states added to the list on Thursday, but health officials say spread of the UK variant will likely accelerate across the country in the weeks and months to come.RAMPING UP VACCINATIONSWith the pressure on healthcare systems growing by the day, political leaders announced steps to quicken the rate of inoculations.On Wednesday, top health officials announced plans to start distributing COVID-19 vaccines through pharmacies around the country earlier than expected this week as states have struggled to administer supplies they have received.The partnership with 19 pharmacy chains will eventually allow the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed program to deliver vaccines to as many as 40,000 locations around the country, U.S. officials said at a news conference on Wednesday.U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also told governors to not let vaccines go unused due to policies requiring healthcare workers get the shots first.If states are struggling to distribute the vaccine, “then by all means you want to be opening up to people 70 and over or 65 and over,” he said.Public health officials say that about 25 percent of healthcare workers are declining the vaccine.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio have bickered over the best vaccination plan in the state, which has recorded more than 38,000 COVID-19 deaths, by far the most of any U.S. state.On Thursday, de Blasio sharply criticized Cuomo for shutting down the mayor’s plan to start vaccinating a second group of people in the state, which includes people 75 or older and frontline “essential” workers.De Blasio said New York City’s public hospitals have thousands of available shots due in part to healthcare workers declining vaccinations. Cuomo argues that all healthcare workers should be vaccinated first before the state opens up inoculations to other residents.In neighboring New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy said on Wednesday that vaccinations are being offered to police, firefighters and other essential workers.“It is not necessary to vaccinate all individuals in one phase before moving on to the next phase,” Judy Persichilli, the state’s health commissioner, said at a news briefing alongside the governor.(Reporting by Maria Caspani, Barbara Goldberg and Michael Erman in New York, Lucia Mutikani in Washington, Anurag Maan in Bengaluru, Lisa Shumaker in Chicago and Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; editing by Bill Berkot, Dan Grebler, Jonathan Oatis and Raju Gopalakrishnan)Share this article in your social networkShare this Story: U.S. wants faster vaccinations as pandemic worsens, job market suffersCopy LinkEmailFacebookTwitterRedditLinkedInTumblrIn-depth reporting on the innovation economy from The Logic, brought to you in partnership with the Financial Post.Top Stories NewsletterSign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.Email AddressThere was an error, please provide a valid email address.By clicking on the sign up button you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.
