Only thing that could speed you up is a provisional clearance, even then you still have to wait for the poly. I was told in august that I was being referred for a poly and im still waiting. Indio is right the wait is just brutal! If you get on though its well worth it. Although Yoda does have me beat, he waited 4 years. I remember when I first found this forum and read Yodas posts, I thought to myself I hope I dont have to wait that long. I probably jinxed myself haha. He got on though so be patient it can and will pay off.Since I applied in 2008 I believe I have Yoda's time beaten now. If not yet, it's close!!CommentPostCancelFirefoxForum MemberJoin Date: Mar 2011Posts: 851ShareTweet#3591201-08-2013, 10:30 PMOriginally posted by -USER- View PostTell me about it!

I remember Barnaj, I just don't remember his dates or his situation. They're still a few long time candidates here and we only represent a small amount of what's truly out there. I just don't want to end up being an example of one. Compared to pony I've got nothing to complain about, but watching all these 11 and 12 testers fly (relatively speaking) through the process is discouraging. My time will come, just wish I could at least get scheduled for a poly. It's been a year since I've had any movement.NYPD Exam: 3310 9/12Score:9X.XX%List#2XX 5/2013NCPD Exam: 2000 12/12PAPD Exam: 6/13 QualifiedCommentPostCancelRms16Forum MemberJoin Date: Mar 2012Posts: 580ShareTweet#3592001-09-2013, 08:02 AMOriginally posted by 66Pony View PostI was formerly BP.

If I remember correctly Yoda had to repeat a lot of steps as well. Getting caught in the never ending cycle of expiring steps is just brutal. I'm surprised they haven't called you again for another pft1. I don't remember how long a buddy of mine waited but they called him to redo it, I think it was awhile though. He was in the process a while as well, then reapplied for SWB(he was waiting for Champlain) and got on quick. Of course he turned it down, bc moving was no longer an option. When I called MHC last they said the only thing that would expire for me is my medical and it's just a form I'd need to fill out. I don't think they thought I'd be waiting more then two years though.NYPD Exam: 3310 9/12Score:9X.XX%List#2XX 5/2013NCPD Exam: 2000 12/12PAPD Exam: 6/13 QualifiedCommentPostCanceltexanjordanForum MemberJoin Date: Jan 2013Posts: 5ShareTweet#3592101-09-2013, 08:15 AMGood morning! I have been lurking for a while now, but I am now posting because I cannot find the answers I am looking for. I have been in the hiring process for BPA and CBPO since Dec 2010, I am currently at the very end of the hiring process. I have my Polygraph scheduled for next wednesday in Chicago which aside from a urinalysis, is my last step for both agencies. I am currently Active Duty military, and my end of enlistment is October of this year. I have over 14 years in, and my command is on board with my decision to make the transition. I can, under a few programs, be separated early from the miltary, but I will need about 8 weeks to have the separation go thru. Once I get \"the call\" based on other posts, it looks like they give you about a month before you EOD. Does anyone have any experience or knowledge on whether or not they work with you on your EOD date? If I ask for 2 months prior to EOD, does anyone have any direct knowlege how they respond?CommentPostCancelAndEscForum MemberJoin Date: Jan 2013Posts: 6ShareTweet#3592201-09-2013, 10:21 AMAny suggestions or tips for my VBT and SI which is next month.

Even if it was allowed, that would suck... no honeymoonThe caveat to my previous statement would be that with the looming sequestration in March, they might only fill one class or even try to fill one and put it on standby until they have a word on funding (thats what they did with the BP). I know there are a lot of concerns within my current agency regarding future spending.On a side note, if you make the next class there is no chance that you are going to be done with training by July. I was offered the last class and FLETC dates if I remember correctly ended late June.CommentPostCancelpaynielForum MemberJoin Date: Sep 2012Posts: 173ShareTweet#3592401-09-2013, 11:21 AMIn regards to future hiring and spending, its going to be interesting if the sequester happens, but wouldnt it make sense from a financial standpoint to keep bringing in newer people who arent being paid nearly as much, and to offer the people who have been around a long time early retirement, etc. Also, after searching for a while, I found some figures on attrition rates for cbp, which generally hover anywhere from 3% to 6% depending on the year. With a force of 21k, that means losing between 600 to 1000 from attrition alone. And hopefully a need to bring more people on, if ,and its a big if, the agency still has funding for that staffing level. On another note, if sequestration happens they could put a hiring freeze in place and let the attrition lean the force out itself, or hopefully people leave voluntarily by retiring, etc, leaving room for more new faces.And if anyone wants to see how I got those attrition rates, I got the numbers from a GAO document as well as some congressional hearings. But it would also be good to point out that the latest year of data for that was 2009, so it could be much lower given the economic circumstances.CBPO:Test- 05/12NOR- 08/12 (95- w/5 point vet pref)TSL1/2-08/12PFT1/Med-09/12VBT/SI-10/12Poly-11/12BI-12/12TSU-01/24/131st \"Call\"-02/26/13- 30 day referral for a better selectionOCSO:Applied- 06/12PFT-07/12CJBAT- 12/12Panel Interview- 01/13BI- in processFBIPhase two: probably neverCommentPostCancelMTByrdForum MemberJoin Date: Aug 2012Posts: 3ShareTweet#3592501-09-2013, 11:44 AMI took the VBT/SI Friday.
