Penney slashes roughly 360 jobs, misses investors expectationsCharisse JonesUSA TODAYJ.C. Penney said Friday that it has eliminated roughly 360 jobs at its headquarters, and at stores throughout the country.The news came as the struggling retailer reported earnings that missed analysts expectations, sending shares plunging in early morning trading.The company said the job cuts were part of its efforts to get a handle on costs, and streamline the company's operations. Roughly 130 positions in the corporate headquarters were cut, and approximately 230 more were eliminated in regional offices and stores. J.C. Penney says that the cuts will lead to annual savings of roughly $20 million to $25 million.\"As the company continues to make progress on its strategic framework and implement new processes and organizational efficiencies, it is imperative that we maintain a thoughtful approach to managing expenses, while effectively supporting the needs of the business,\" Marvin Ellison, the company's CEO said in a statement.Like many retailers, J.C. Penney had an upbeat holiday season, with sales at stores open at least a year (an industry standard for measuring financial performance) rising 2.6% during the final months of 2017. Shoppers especially scooped up jewelry, beauty products and footwear.But the retailer's $4.03 billion in revenue missed the $4.04 billion expectation of analysts with S&P Global Intelligence. Shares were down 5.36% to $3.71 when the market closed Friday.More:J.C. Penney is closing eight more stores. Is yours on the list?More:J.C. Penney to close Wisconsin facility, cut 670 jobsMore:J.C. Penney sees bright holiday sales as its fortunes riseWhile J.C. Penney's net income was $254 million during the holiday period, or 81 cents per share, up from $192 million or 61 cents in 2016, it reported a loss for the full year.The quarterly bump was largely due to a $75 million benefit from recently passed federal tax legislation. And full-year net income fell $116 million, or 37 cents per share as compared to a $1 million profit in 2016.Hugh Tallents, partner at the management consultancy cg42, says that investors likely compared the strategies of retailers such as Best Buy and Nordstrom who also reported their earnings this week, and found J.C. Penney's lacking.\"They're all trying to get toward . . . a better blend between a physical and digital experience,'' he said, \"and analysts are looking at J.C. Penney as a laggard in the innovation of experience.''J.C. Penney shuttered 141 stores last year, as it tried to shrink its footprint, strengthen its e-commerce experience, and expand its services to attract shoppers at a time when they are increasingly turning to Amazon and other online sites.Last month, the list of closures grew with the retailer announcing that it will shut roughly 8 stores this year, eliminating the jobs of roughly 480 employees. That same week, it said it would be closing a distribution center in Wauwatosa, Wis., this summer, leading to the loss of 670 jobs.In addition to cuts, the retailer has tried to improve its products and services. It's sped up the time it takes to get contemporary fashion offerings on its racks, teamed up with popular beauty retailer Sephora, and boosted its sales of appliances to appeal to shoppers.Some of those moves appeared to pay off in the fourth quarter. While clothing sales lagged, shoppers filled their carts with beauty products, along with fine jewelry, shoes and handbags. The retailer has also invested more in home products, and purchases of appliances experienced a 30% sales spike in the fourth quarter.Going forward, the company says it will open roughly 30 more Sephora shops inside its stores this year, bringing the total to 670 locations. It's re-branding 100 more salons in 2018.And the company is doubling down on the home category, with Ellison saying the company has pinpointed more than 300 malls where it will \"aggressively pursue'' selling products like mattresses, appliances and simple home installations.The retailer is also trying to improve its fashion selection, focusing particularly on women's activewear, and expanding its mix of Adidas and Nike products while launching new sportswear brands like Champion and Puma.But all those moves may still not be distinctive or significant enough to help J.C. Penney stand out from the crowd, Tallents says.\"There's better ways to get all the things that J.C. Penney sells,'' he says. \"Unless you can really define a specific reason for people to come to J.C. Penney, (customers) are going to go to the path of least resistance, which is Amazon.''About Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Corrections Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Terms of Service Your California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info/Cookie PolicyContact Us Help Center My Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop Licensing & Reprints Advertise Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Pinterest YouTube Reddit Flipboard RSS10Best Reviewed Jobs Moonlighting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett ClassifiedsThe City The Wall StorytellersÂ© 2021 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.|styles|[data-g-s=nav_ao] .gnt_n_dd_bt_svg{transform:rotate(180deg);background:currentColor;fill:#303030}.gnt_n_dd_oy{display:none;left:0;right:0;height:calc(var(--gnt-vh,100vh) - 160px - var(--gnt-sh,0px))}.gnt_n_dd{overscroll-behavior-y:contain;overflow:auto;overflow-x:hidden;box-sizing:border-box;display:none;width:385px;height:calc(var(--gnt-vh,100vh) - 160px - var(--gnt-sh,0px));margin:0 0 0 -20px;padding:7px 20px 0 32px;border-top:5px solid #0098fe;background:#303030;color:#fff}.gnt__hnb .gnt_n_dd__sz{height:calc(var(--gnt-vh,100vh) - 80px - var(--gnt-sh,0px))}[data-g-s=nav_ao] .gnt_n_dd__sz{display:block;position:absolute}|styles|.gnt_n_se_fm{display:none;align-items:center;justify-content:center;position:absolute;left:0;right:0;height:180px;padding:0 0 15px;border-top:5px solid #0098fe;background:#303030}[data-g-s~=nav_ao] .gnt_n_se_fm{display:flex}.gnt_n_se_fm_qr{width:492px;height:46px;padding:0 50px 0 0;border-style:solid;border-width:0 0 2px;border-color:#fff;border-radius:0;outline:0;background:0 0;color:#fff;font:700 28px 'Unify Sans','Helvetica Neue','Arial Nova',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif}.gnt_n_se_fm_qr::placeholder{opacity:1;color:#fff}.gnt_n_se_fm_qr:-webkit-autofill{box-shadow:inset 0 46px #303030;-webkit-text-fill-color:#fff}.gnt_n_se_fm_sm{width:60px;height:50px;border:0;margin:0 -15px 0 -45px;padding:0;outline-offset:-8px;fill:#fff;background:0 0;cursor:pointer}.gnt_n_se_fm_sm:hover{fill:#e0e0e0}.gnt_n_se_fm_sm_svg{width:42px;height:42px;margin-top:3px;stroke:#303030;stroke-width:.5px} Access eNewspaper Newsletters Pay Bill Report Delivery Issues Pause Delivery Subscriber Guide Help Center Sign OutHave an existing account?Sign InAlready have a subscription?Activate accountDon't have an account?Create account|styles|.gnt_n_us_a_w{position:relative}.gnt_n_us_dd{display:none;position:absolute;top:28px;right:25px;padding:14px 0 14px 15px;border-top:5px solid #0098fe;background:#303030}[data-g-s~=nav_ao] .gnt_n_us_dd{display:flex}.gnt_n_us_dd_u{display:flex;flex-direction:column;min-width:165px;padding-right:15px}.gnt_n_us_dd_a{margin:3px auto 4px 3px;padding:0 2px;color:#fff;font:700 14px/18px 'Unify Sans','Helvetica Neue','Arial Nova',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-decoration:none;white-space:nowrap}.gnt_n_us_dd_a:hover{color:#e0e0e0}.gnt_n_us_dd_ac{padding:0 15px 0 19px;border-left:1px solid #626262}.gnt_n_us_dd_lbl{margin:5px 0 0;color:#fff;font:700 12px/16px 'Helvetica Neue','Arial Nova',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif}.gnt_n_us_dd_ba{display:block;width:192px;margin:3px 0 19px;padding:9px 1px 8px;border:3px solid #1665cf;outline-offset:-1px;color:#fff;font:700 14px/17px 'Unify Sans','Helvetica Neue','Arial Nova',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;text-decoration:none;text-align:center}.gnt_n_us_dd_ba__hl{padding:12px 4px 11px!important;border:0!important;background:var(--gnt-bc,#1665cf)}.gnt_n_us_dd_ba:hover{padding:8px 0 7px;border-width:4px;--gnt-bc:#0A32A0}.gnt_n_us_dd_a__li{margin-bottom:6px}"
