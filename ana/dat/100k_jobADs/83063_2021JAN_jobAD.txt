"Need a Job? Consider a Career in Cannabis – Mary Jane ContentSkip to contentMary Jane ContentConnecting Canna-Businesses with the Content they DeserveMenuHomeBlogWriter ProfilesNeed a Job? Consider a Career in CannabisPosted on August 27, 2014 June 22, 2016 by Abby	The second ever job fair dedicated to jobs in the cannabis industry has been set for September 16, 2014 at Mile High Stadium in Denver, Co. The event is set up to host many different cannabis industries and include positions in IT, marketing, distribution and cultivation, and could potentially offer hundreds of Colorado residents new employment in the industry.The first event, which took place last February, drew in over 1,000 job seekers — about 30 percent above projection — and filled about 150 cannabis jobs. Given the huge success of this event (and the fact that so many eagerly await their chance at the “green rush”), the second event is expected to be just as, if not more, successful than the first.If you’re interested in joining the fair, either as a vendor or job seeker, then visit the CannaSearch website and reserve your place in line. You can also follow CannaSearch on Facebook to stay up-to-date on the latest CannaSearch Job Fair information and join in on contests to help set you up for the event.I hope to see you there!//Share this:TwitterFacebookRedditPinterestLike this:Like Loading...RelatedPosted in cultureTagged cannabis careers, cannabis industry, job fair, marijuanaPost navigationCould Marijuana Donations Help Medicate the Poor?(Not All of Colorado is High) Crime, Teen Marijuana Use and Suicide Down After Marijuana LegalizationOne thought on “Need a Job?
