Here is one skill that 90% of job seekers typically ignore.What is this ignored skill? Writing.“If you are trying to decide among a few people to fill a position, hire the best writer. Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else’s shoes. They know how to omit. And those are qualities you want in any candidate.” – Jason Fried, author of ReworkClear Writing Means Clear ThinkingSimply put, employers seek strong writers. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, 73.4% of employers look for candidates with strong writing skills.[1]AdvertisingKyle Wiens also remarks in I Won’t Hire People Who Use Poor Grammar. Here’s Why [2],“Good grammar makes good business sense – and not just when it comes to hiring writers. Grammar signifies more than just a person’s ability to remember high school English. I’ve found that people who make fewer mistakes on a grammar test also make fewer mistakes when they are doing something unrelated to writing – like stocking shelves and labeling parts.”Wiens in fact uses grammar as his litmus test. He made his employees to prove whether they were detail-oriented with the grammar test.People typically do not write well and this impacts future career potential. If you do not possess the skills necessary to write well, why would a prospective employer put trust and faith in your ability to be an effective communicator? Try the following exercise if you do not believe me.

But fewer know how to measure productivity, or even what exactly we are talking about when using the term “productivity.”In its simplest form, the productivity formula looks like this: Output ÷ Input = Productivity.For example, you have two salespeople each making 10 calls to customers per week. The first one averages 2 sales per week and the second one averages 3 sales per week. By plugging in the numbers we get the following productivity levels for each sales person.For salesperson one, the output is 2 sales and the input is 10 sales: 2 ÷ 10 = .2 or 20% productivity. For salesperson two, the output is 3 sales and the input is 10 sales: 3 ÷ 10 = .3 or 30% productivity.Knowing how to measure and interpret productivity is an invaluable asset for any manager or business owner in today’s world. As an example, in the above scenario, salesperson #1 is clearly not doing as well as salesperson #2.Knowing this information we can now better determine what course of action to take with salesperson #1.Some possible outcomes might be to require more in-house training for that salesperson, or to have them accompany the more productive salesperson to learn a better technique. It might be that salesperson #1 just isn’t suited for sales and would do a better job in a different position.How to Measure Productivity With Management TechniquesKnowing how to measure productivity allows you to fine tune your business by minimizing costs and maximizing profits:1. Identify Long and Short-Term GoalsHaving a good understanding of what you (or your company’s) goals are is key to measuring productivity.For example, if your company’s goal is to maximize market share, you’ll want to measure your team’s productivity by their ability to acquire new customers, not necessarily on actual sales made.2. Break Down Goals Into Smaller Weekly ObjectivesYour long-term goal might be to get 1,000 new customers in a year. That’s going to be 20 new customers per week. If you have 5 people on your team, then each one needs to bring in 4 new customers per week.Now that you’ve broken it down, you can track each person’s productivity week-by-week just by plugging in the numbers:	AdvertisingProductivity = number of new customers ÷ number of sales calls made3. Create a SystemHave you ever noticed that whenever you walk into a McDonald’s, the French fry machine is always to your left?This is because McDonald’s created a system. They have determined that the most efficient way to set up a kitchen is to always have the French fry machine on the left when you walk in.You can do the same thing and just adapt it to your business.Let’s say that you know that your most productive salespeople are making the most sales between the hours of 3 and 7 pm. If the other salespeople are working from 9 am to 4 pm, you can potentially increase productivity through something as simple as adjusting the workday.Knowing how to measure productivity allows you to set up, monitor, and fine tune systems to maximize output.4. Evaluate, Evaluate, Evaluate!We’ve already touched on using these productivity numbers to evaluate and monitor your employees, but don’t forget to evaluate yourself using these same measurements.If you have set up a system to track and measure employees’ performance, but you’re still not meeting goals, it may be time to look at your management style. After all, your management is a big part of the input side of our equation.Are you more of a carrot or a stick type of manager? Maybe you can try being more of the opposite type to see if that changes productivity. Are you managing your employees as a group? Perhaps taking a more one-on-one approach would be a better way to utilize each individual’s strengths and weaknesses.Just remember that you and your management style contribute directly to your employees’ productivity.5. Use a Ratings ScaleHaving clear and concise objectives for individual employees is a crucial part of any attempt to increase workplace productivity. Once you have set the goals or objectives, it’s important that your employees are given regular feedback regarding their progress.Using a ratings scale is a good way to provide a standardized visual representation of progress. Using a scale of 1-5 or 1-10 is a good way to give clear and concise feedback on an individual basis.	AdvertisingIt’s also a good way to track long-term progress and growth in areas that need improvement.6. Hire “Mystery Shoppers”This is especially helpful in retail operations where customer service is critical. A mystery shopper can give feedback based on what a typical customer is likely to experience.You can hire your own shopper, or there are firms that will provide them for you. No matter which route you choose, it’s important that the mystery shoppers have a standardized checklist for their evaluation.You can request evaluations for your employees friendliness, how long it took to greet the shopper, employees’ knowledge of the products or services, and just about anything else that’s important to a retail operation.7. Offer Feedback FormsUsing a feedback form is a great way to get direct input from existing customers. There are just a couple of things to keep in mind when using feedback forms.First, keep the form short, 2-3 questions max with a space for any additional comments. Asking people to fill out a long form with lots of questions will significantly reduce the amount of information you receive.Secondly, be aware that customers are much more likely to submit feedback forms when they are unhappy or have a complaint than when they are satisfied.You can offset this tendency by asking everyone to take the survey at the end of their interaction. This will increase compliance and give you a broader range of customer experiences, which will help as you’re learning how to measure productivity.8. Track Cost EffectivenessThis is a great metric to have, especially if your employees have some discretion over their budgets. You can track how much each person spends and how they spend it against their productivity.Again, this one is easy to plug into the equation: Productivity = amount of money brought in ÷ amount of money spent.Having this information is very useful in forecasting expenses and estimating budgets.9. Use Self-EvaluationsAsking your staff to do self evaluations can be a win-win for everyone. Studies have shown that when employees feel that they are involved and their input is taken seriously, morale improves. And as we all know, high employee morale translates into higher productivity.	AdvertisingUsing self-evaluations is also a good way to make sure that the employees and employers goals are in alignment.10. Monitor Time ManagementThis is the number one killer of productivity in the workplace. Time spent browsing the internet, playing games, checking email, and making personal calls all contribute to lower productivity[1].The trick is to limit these activities without becoming overbearing and affecting morale. Studies have shown that most people will adhere to rules that they feel are fair and applied to everyone equally.While ideally, we may think that none of these activities should be done on company time, employees will almost certainly have a different opinion. From a productivity standpoint, it is best to have policies and rules that are seen as fair to both sides as you’re learning how to measure productivity.11. Analyze New Customer AcquisitionWe’ve all heard the phrase that “It’s more expensive to get a new customer than it is to keep an existing one.” And while that is very true, in order for your business to keep growing, you will need to continually add new customers.Knowing how to measure productivity via new customer acquisition will make sure that your marketing dollars are being spent in the most efficient way possible. This is another metric that’s easy to plug into the formula: Productivity = number of new customers ÷ amount of money spent to acquire those customers.For example, if you run any kind of advertising campaign, you can compare results and base your future spending accordingly.Let’s say that your total advertising budget is $3,000. You put $2,000 into television ads, $700 into radio ads, and $300 into print ads. When you track the results, you find that your television ad produced 50 new customers, your radio ad produced 15 new customers, and your print ad produced 9 new customers.Let’s plug those numbers into our equation. Television produced 50 new customers at a cost of $2,000 (50 ÷ 2000 = .025, or a productivity rate of 2.5%). The radio ads produced 15 new customers and cost $700 (15 ÷ 700 = .022, or a 2.2% productivity rate). Print ads brought in 9 new customers and cost $300 (9 ÷ 300 = .03, or a 3% return on productivity).From this analysis, it is clear that you would be getting the biggest bang for your advertising dollar using print ads.12. Utilize Peer FeedbackThis is especially useful when people who work in teams or groups. While self-assessments can be very useful, the average person is notoriously bad at assessing their own abilities.	AdvertisingJust ask a room full of people how many consider themselves to be an above average driver and you’ll see 70% of the hands go up[2]! Now we clearly know that in reality about 25% of drivers are below average, 25% are above average, and 50% are average.Are all these people lying? No, they just don’t have an accurate assessment of their own abilities.It’s the same in the workplace. Using peer feedback will often provide a more accurate assessment of a person’s ability than a self-assessment would.13. Encourage Innovation and Don’t Penalize FailureWhen it comes to productivity, encouraging employee input and adopting their ideas can be a great way to boost productivity. Just make sure that any changes you adopt translate into higher productivity.Let’s say that someone comes to you requesting an entertainment budget so that they can take potential customers golfing or out to dinner. By utilizing simple productivity metrics, you can easily produce a cost benefit analysis and either expand the program to the rest of the sales team, or terminate it completely.Either way, you have gained valuable knowledge and boosted morale by including employees in the decision-making process.14. Use an External EvaluatorUsing an external evaluator is the pinnacle of objective evaluations. Firms that provide professional evaluations use highly trained personnel that even specialize in specific industries.They will design a complete analysis of your business’ productivity level. In their final report, they will offer suggestions and recommendations on how to improve productivity.While the benefits of a professional evaluation are many, their costs make them prohibitive for most businesses.Final ThoughtsThese are just a few of the things you can do when learning how to measure productivity. Some may work for your particular situation, and some may not.The most important thing to remember when deciding how to track productivity is to choose a method consistent with your goals. Once you’ve decided on that, it’s just a matter of continuously monitoring your progress, making minor adjustments, and analyzing the results of those adjustments.The business world is changing fast, and having the right tools to track and monitor your productivity can give you the edge over your competition.More Productivity Tips50 Ways to Increase Productivity and Achieve More in Less Time35 Quick and Simple Tips for Better Productivity40 Powerful Productivity Quotes From Highly Successful PeopleFeatured photo credit: William Iven via unsplash.comReference[1] ^ The Balance: 11 Time Management Tips That Work[2] ^ Association for Psychological Science: When It Comes To Driving, Most People Think Their Skills are Above AverageSharePin itTweetShareEmailAdvertisingAdvertisingRead NextEffective Decision Making Process: How to Make Wise DecisionsHow to Set Long Term Goals and Achieve Success8 Differences Between a Leader and a ManagerAdvertisingAdvertisingMore by this authorDavid CarpenterLifelong entrepreneur and business owner helping others to realize the American Dream of business ownershipHow to Live up to Your Full Potential and Succeed in LifeHow to Change Your Life at 60 Years Old and Feel Proud of Yourself14 Ideas on How to Measure Productivity to Make ProgressHow to Become an Entrepreneur (A Serial Entrepreneur’s Advice)10 Simple Yet Powerful Business Goals to Set This YearAdvertisingTrending in Productivity1 4 Effective Ways To Collaborate With Your Team 2 Why Your Habits Hinder You From Reaching Your Goals 3 We Do What We Know Is Bad for Us, Why? 4 13 Bad Habits You Need to Quit Right Away 5 How to Reprogram Your Brain Like a Computer And Hack Your HabitsRead Next14 Ideas on How to Measure Productivity to Make Progress11 Things You Can Do to Increase Employee ProductivityWhy Is Time Management Important For Peak Productivity?7 Benefits of Bullet Journaling and Why It’s Great for EveryoneAboutWrite for UsContact UsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy Policy© 2005 - 2021 Lifehack · All Rights Reserved."
