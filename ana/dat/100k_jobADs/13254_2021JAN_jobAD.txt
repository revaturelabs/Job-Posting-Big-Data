Its implications are severe because of the devastating fall in income and economic security for a family. It has an impact on the parents’ mental and physical health. In addition, it affects family relationships and can result to marital conflicts.When a person is laid off, economic concerns come up. He starts to ponder on how he will be able to sustain his family without any job. In a case where an individual has savings, his main worry will be how long the savings will sustain the family.An individual is also affected emotionally when he or she loses a job. The parent will first experience shock, disbelief and denial. Afterwards, anxiety and fear come in due to the unknown future. People experience fears of: paying bills, sustaining their families, finding another job and maintaining their current living standards. In addition, an individual gets depressed. This may result to a parent stopping doing his daily activities. Similarly, anger and frustration are experienced in some parents. In some cases, these parents may direct their anger to other persons in the community or family. Finally, some people experience shame after a layout.Social impacts are evident after a job loss. The relationship that people have changes after a layoff. This leads to the feeling of isolation and loneliness by the parent affected. In addition, a layoff affects the personal identity of a person. This mostly affects those parents who identify themselves with the jobs. These parents usually feel empty after a layoff and question whom they are. Consequently, they have an impact on the families. It could lead to a reversal of roles and a change in the living standards. In addition, the children are greatly affected in terms of school performance, and the support they get from parents. The children usually are the ones that pay the price of a layoff. Also, it can lead to less support and conflicts in marriages. In some circumstances, a layoff can lead to divorce.Valentin was a renowned man in the Juna village. His great stature was due to the wealth he had accumulated over the years. He was one of the lucky fellas who had been employed by the Kingsley Company. Kingsley Company dealt with selling and repair of electric appliances. Every person in the village envied him and wished to be like Valentin. Pearl, a beautiful charming lady in the village, worked her way and got married to Valentin. She had been attracted to Valentin because of his wealth. She did know life is like a box of chocolates; one never knows what to get.In the Juna Village men who had many children were highly respected. Valentin did not want to miss among that list. They had five children in quick succession. They were able to raise their kids well and took them to good schools.After some years, an economic crisis affected Kingsley Company, and it was forced to lay off some workers. Unfortunately, Valentin was among the workers laid off. Upon hearing the news, he drowned into a sea of grief. He entered into a state of shock, disbelief and denial. He could be heard gabbling statements like: “this cannot be happening”. When her wife heard about the news, she broke into tears. She knew that their main source of finance to the family had been cut off. The family had now to rely on a few pennies they got from Pearl’s business. She had started a business of selling foodstuffs to the village.Depression engulfed Valentin Completely. It did not take time for the whole village to know what had befallen their man of great stature. The job loss affected Valentin emotionally, and his pride tremendously reduced. In addition, it affected the performance of their children in school. After a while, the parents were forced to transfer them to cheaper schools where they could afford school fees. In addition, they had to sell some of their belongings and cars in order to sustain their lives.Quarrels and fights became the order of the day. Pearl could not find Valentin lovable again. They fought like cats and dogs when they disagreed slightly. After untenable disagreements, they divorced and agreed on a scheme supporting their children. Pearl’s love that was as deep as the ocean existed no more.Valentin could not believe how the world had turned upside down. He spent his time in the house pondering his next move. Also, he did not want to intermingle with people. He had sold almost all his belongings, and his stature in the village was no more. After a year, he suffered from high blood pressure. This was a result of the high stress he was experiencing.Their children were affected in their school performance. This was due to the scorns and insults they got from their fellow children at school. The school fees, though minimal, was sometimes difficult to get, and they were often sent out of school. Valentin is now selling second-hand clothes to make ends meet.A job loss of a parent has negative impacts not only on the parent but also the family. It affects the parent emotionally, economically and socially. In addition, it deprives the parent’s personal identity. Therefore, a job loss has depressing effects on the parent’s family.Works Cited;McNaught, Denise. When a Parent Loses a Job: A Workbook About My Parent's Job Loss.
