Puyallup continues to serve its residents and neighbors with a strong, diversified economy. Puyallup is famous for hosting the Washington State Fair twice every year. Traffic volume of the City has been on a rapid and steady growth. To serve the residents with better traffic operations and to manage the increasing congestion level, the City has been pursing the installation of the most advanced traffic signal control system to operate the major corridors of downtown Puyallup.​​The Puyallup Adaptive Project will implement ASCT at seventeen (17) intersections on two arterial streets. These streets are Meridian (SR 161) from River Rd to 23rd Ave SE; and the bypass corridor ( 3rd St SE/2nd St NE) from Meridian to River Rd. Additional intersections will be added to the selected Adaptive Signal System in the future. The ASCT will operate on the existing type 170 traffic signal controller or new type 2070 signal controller.​​The purpose of the project is to provide safe, reliable, sustainable, smooth multimodal traffic operation through the downtown corridor.​​The Project map and study intersections are shown in the figure below.5th St SW/NW Adaptive Signal Controls9th & 9th Traffic Circle31st Ave SE & 5th St. SE Signal InstallationAdaptive System ImplementationEast Main & 5th Ave Signal InstallationNeighborhood Traffic Safety CalmingRiver Road and 9th St SW Safety ImprovementsReport or AskNotify Me®Maps / GISAgendas & MinutesOnline PaymentsContact UsPuyallup City Hall333 S.
