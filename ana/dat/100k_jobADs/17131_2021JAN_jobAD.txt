At EY, we are helping organisations transform, to continually improve the way they ‘do business’ and lead in the market. We are doing this by challenging the norm, by taking on the ‘too hard’ problems and by helping organisations become insight driven .Whilst Analytics and AI are driving the transformation, we all know that success isn’t possible without someone taking care of the hard stuff, that is, the difficult platform and data engineering work…and let’s be honest, most of the work needed when creating and deploying analytical solutions is in the ‘data space’.We have a fast-growing Data & Analytics practice within Advisory, where Platform & Data Engineering expertise is key for driving growth.
