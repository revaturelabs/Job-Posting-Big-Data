Our region is proud of our many thriving communities and local businesses who have been supported on the back of mining.But times are changing. Many of our once vibrant communities are becoming ghost towns. Big business is trying to make a quick buck by cutting secure jobs for locals. As a result, schools have less teachers, small businesses are shutting and locals are moving away.We want our kids to have the same opportunities as we did. We want them to grow up in flourishing communities. The only thing that will secure our communities’ future is local, secure jobs.With the uncertainty of insecure jobs, which continue to be harmful to the livelihoods of many people and the stability of our communities, we the undersigned call upon elected members and governments to mandate protections for a stable and ongoing consistency for the workforce and a return to job security.Who's
