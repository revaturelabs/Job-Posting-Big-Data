On top of hosting job ads, JobStreet.com also offers a comprehensive and dedicated service to help you find the most time-efficient and cost-effective recruitment process.Since its launch in 1995, JobStreet.com has grown to become one of the leading online recruitment sites in Southeast Asia. Founded in 2012, JobStreet.com Vietnam (VN) was established to build on the success of JobStreet.com, and within the first few months of opening they hosted thousands of active job ads.Jobboard Finder’s opinionSummary: In 1997, Jobstreet was created by Malaysian businessman, Mark Chang Mun Kee, who also created the e-payment enabler website, MOL.com. In 2014, SEEK bought the aggregator to extend their Asian reach (they already owned 60% of JobsDB and 78.2% of Zhaopin). Powered by Jora, this Jobstreet is slightly different to the others. Despite the “Jobstreet” logo, it has the same layout as Jora sites. An impressive 2.27 million visits a month, mostly from Vietnam, are recorded by SimilarWeb each month but, unlike the other Jobstreets, there is no social media. The Jobstreet group is present in Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam and has an extensive list of partners.Design: As an aggregator, this site has a rather minimalistic design. On the homepage, there is just a search engine (keywords and location) and the logo. To browse the companies, you can click on ‘company profiles’ at the top of the page. The pages have an attractive layout, including photos, a map, a description and key information (the site, company size, vision, language used, work hours, dress code, etc.). You can even see similar companies. Once you access the job listing, the filters (publication date, type of hours, title, company, location) indicate the number of jobs for each category. Users will appreciate the UX writing, helping navigate the site. If the job offer has been posted through Jobstreet, it is indicated in gray just under the short description. If it isn’t, you’ll only see the publication date. No logos are visible but “new” offers are listed as such. The offer has no particular branding, and you can click on a blue button for more information at the bottom of the description. For those posted directly through the site, the layout is far more structured: experience, location and salary at the top of the page, a description on the left, the company profile on the right.The job board objective: Jobstreet helps centralize the job opportunities around Vietnam.Recruiter observations: To post a job offer, recruiters must fill out an inquiry form on the recruitment page, which requires a phone number, state, country and how you found the site. Only the recruiter page is available in English.Jobseeker observations: Jobseekers must create an account to apply to job offers posted directly to Jobstreet.The job offers: There are currently 121 499 job offers on the site. Most of the jobs are for full time jobs.Reactivity: The team answers within a day.Special features: The blog (career advice); job alerts.Verdict: Clearly, Jobstreet guaranties high visibility for job offers in Vietnam. It’s a shame that this site is more of an aggregator than a national site, like the other Jobstreet. Jobseekers will be happy to have all of the offers in one easy-to-browse online space.Written by Ali NeillAs the job board tester and blog editor for the Jobboard Finder, Ali works on job boards from all around the world and keeps a close eye on the recruitment trends thanks to a number of sources, including the website's social media pages.Login here for FREE to unlock access to the traffic audience, content and pricing section for more information on Jobstreet.Sign up to access this feature, it’s FREE!You already have an account?
