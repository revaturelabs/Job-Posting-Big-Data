The one in CA is for an MRU (Military Radar Unit, aka, Range Control) but at GS-12 who would complain.....SSgt YoungStuckMic Marine Corps LiaisonJan 21, 201038611840ArizonaFeb 28, 2011#2Any idea what they are posted under? I can't seem to find them with my searches.Roddy_PiperResident KnuckleheadJun 15, 20083,3391838Vegas babywww.myspace.comFeb 28, 2011#3SPORT (Space Positioning Optical Radar Tracking Control facility) is a DOD MRU making GS12/13 pay. i'm sure this is the job listed at Edwards. it's a sweet gig, cuz u don't do much and u make good money.VVM_AIRBOSSSenior MemberDec 28, 2009185016Melbourne, FLMar 2, 2011#4SSgt Young, try this little trick and see if it doesn't list a few more announcements that you can't seem to find on USAJOBs. Go to the USAJOBs Homepage, and type in Air Traffic Control, and don't bother to type in a location, because I assume that you want to look at them all. Once the page loads and lists all the announcements, look over to the upper right and you will see a Current Search box, with two radio button tabs.....click the one that says all, and watch the list change with all the ones I mentioned, but you can't find..... Good luck!SSgt YoungStuckMic Marine Corps LiaisonJan 21, 201038611840ArizonaMar 2, 2011#5Top you are awesome, thanks!!!!VVM_AIRBOSSSenior MemberDec 28, 2009185016Melbourne, FLMar 2, 2011#6No worries, I am just doing for you what someone did for me, and I am sure you will do for another.....that is what this is all about, paying it forward, passing it along, and helping eachother out.....Obviously it worked for you....lol!JJayTangoJunior MemberFeb 21, 2016110016Aug 3, 2019#7I’m going to bump this thread back from the dead. Anyone have any contacts at SPORT MRU? I’d love to get a job there. I’m already living in SoCal and a LA native if that matters.RRamfan402NewcomerMar 17, 20171301Aug 6, 2019#8I work at SPORT. At least till the 16th. Heading to Anchorage. Really not easy to get into without knowing the right folks. My spot will be the only opening for a while and if you're FAA eligible they're not likely to hire you. I was a rare exception.AATCFLORESNewcomerMar 11, 2019301Dec 10, 2019#9Ramfan402 said:I work at SPORT. At least till the 16th. Heading to Anchorage.
