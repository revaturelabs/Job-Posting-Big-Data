He won silver for light-heavyweight weightlifting and went on to become a wrestler named Tosh Togo.But, of course, his favorite role was “Odd Job” and that name stuck to him beyond the Goldfinger movie. He went on to play in other movies and commercials.Sakata died of cancer on July 29, 1982.Harold Sakata as Odd JobRate this:Share this:FacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailPrintPinterestMoreRedditTumblrPocketLike this:Like Loading...RelatedThis entry was posted in Olympics, Other and tagged Goldfinger, Harold Sakata, James Bond, Odd Job, Tosh Togo.
