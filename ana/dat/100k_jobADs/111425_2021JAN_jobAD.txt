Soccer has one break at halftime but that's it. American sports may be more exiting when something is happening but soccer is more exiting on average.Soccer is not popular in the US because there are not enough commercial breaksAbsolutely. The prime sports channels won't show it because there are no endless breaks to show the endless commercials. It's better to show basketball or baseball, where you get to show a one minute commercial for every one minute of game.3 years ago # QUOTE 2 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist64bcI am an American and a soccer convert. I love it. I don't know how you could watch a game like yesterday's Dortmond/Rel Madrid match and not think it is exciting.I think a lot of the anti-soccer sentiment in the U.S. is subtle anti-globalism, usually by older men. It isn't a U.S. product, and so it must be inferior.This reads like a parody of the American hipster pose of pretending to find soccer wildly entertaining as a way to signal sophistication and cosmopolitanism.Op has admitted that baseball is objectively boring but people consume it for cultural reasons. Why can't u soccer tards have enough self-awareness to do the same?3 years ago # QUOTE 3 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist4983baseball >>>>> basketball >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> soccer3 years ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 2 No Jab !Economist1897I am an American and a soccer convert.

Why can't u soccer tards have enough self-awareness to do the same?Don't act like the anti-soccer nuts aren't social signaling as well. Including you. But why someone would want to signal that they are chauvanistic, xenophobic, insular, narrow minded, and driven by fear is beyond me. Truly anti-soccer tards. Good thing is the bulk of your type are literally dying off. We got rid of one just last month. I guess Fran deford choked to death while having soccer rammed down his throat. Lol.3 years ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 1 No Jab !Economist1897Americans will usually admit that baseball is boring. Because it is. There's not much actual action and the scoring is random. Baseball is liked because it's an American historical/cultural thing and some people just enjoy the structure of the game... But if you don't just kind of innately enjoy it you wont ever enjoy it.Soccer is also boring as s**t where 90% of the game is irrelevant passes that lead to nothing and the other 10% is attempts at kicks that fly wide right of the massive ass goal*.*That's another thing, why is everyone so f**king bad? The goal is f**king huge. How do they fail so damn horribly all the time? It'd be like if every other shot in basketball was a horrible airball.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN8GVYhsXC8Soccer players aren't \"bad\" you idiot. It's just harder to execute a good shot on goal than, say, shoot a basketball. Basketball is WAY too easy. The sport violates the scarcity principal of value. A basket just isn't worth s**t. And the more of them scored reduces their value proportionately. Thats why anti-soccer tard frank deford said \"there is a real lack of proficiency in the Game (soccer)\". He was always a basketball ass and viewed everything else through that prism. Moreover, isn't it inconsistent that 'merica hacked anti-soccer tards are always praising baseball because it's so damned hard to hit that stupid little ball. \"It's the hardest single thing in sports to do\" these idiots constantly say. Why isn't that an example of a Game with a real lack of proficiency?3 years ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 1 No Jab !Economist8ef6I hate flopping. Therefore, I hate basketball and soccer.

The game actually involves strategy which is completely missing in many other sports.2 years ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economistf459Basketball is the most boring sport for me because nothing of significance can happen and so there is no tension. A player can do the most amazing play in the world and its still only worth 2 or 3 points over the course of the game, and the next team will score another basket 30 seconds later. There are no highs or lows, its just flat.Football (soccer) is good because goals mean so much - there is a huge amount of tension when the ball is around the box, because a single goal will completely change the game. Sports which have scorelines like 46-42 dont have this and they are dull, in my opinionOnly a moron finds zero action MORE exciting. Soccer is the sport with no clothes.1 year ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 1 No Jab !« Previous1…56ReplyPost	Send Post »Markup: a blockquote code em strong ul ol li.Economics Job Market Rumors | Job Market | Conferences | Employers | Journal Submissions | Links | Privacy | Contact | Night ModeDefault Personality Textbook In the Club Rouge Mod Old Krug New Krug Kentucky NuSchool UKAP Sturmy Weather Not Brogues The Real Cambridge Lee Kuan Blue Beethoven Honkers Tokyo Drift Concert Hall Don't Pluck with the Chuck Troll Farm"
