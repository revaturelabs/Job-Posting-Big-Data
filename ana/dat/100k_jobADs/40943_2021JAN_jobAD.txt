(B.C. government)B.C. Indigenous rights overhaul first job of 2020, John Horgan saysPremier speaks to Assembly of First Nations in Ottawa next weekTom FletcherNov. 29, 2019 12:00 p.m.BusinessGiving royal assent to B.C.’s latest batch of laws this week, Lt. Governor Janet Austin singled out one for special mention – the world’s first official adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.That’s unusual, and it is for good reason, Premier John Horgan told reporters after the fall session of the B.C. legislature adjourned.“It will transform how we do business in B.C. for the better,” Horgan said. “Unanimous support in the legislature, business interests around the province, in fact around the country, looking to B.C. as a leader in how we better make all of the people of British Columbia benefit from the extraordinary bounty we have here.”Work begins in January to start amending B.C. laws to meet the dozens of objectives of UNDRIP, and the first set of changes is expected in the spring session that begins in February, Horgan said.Premier @jjhorgan says @scottfraserndp begins work on #UNDRIP in January, after “200 years of colonial activity” #bcleg #bcpoli pic.twitter.com/5xsvoDNoqY— Tom Fletcher (@tomfletcherbc) November 29, 2019RELATED: B.C. environmental law overhauled to comply with UNDRIPRELATED: B.C. to transfer $100M from gambling to Indigenous people“I think the patience of Indigenous communities has been well demonstrated over the 200 years of colonial activity here in B.C. and across Canada,” Horgan said. “I’ve been invited to speak to the Assembly of First Nations in Ottawa next week about what we’ve been able to accomplish here, and I’m sure I’ll get some advice from elders and others about how we proceed in the new year.”Horgan praised the B.C. Liberal and Green Parties for joining his government’s support for the change, after detailed questioning of its implications over the past two weeks.“I want to ensure that the public understand that this is not just the NDP who’s doing this,” Horgan said.B.C. Liberal MLA Mike de Jong, a former minister of finance, Indigenous relations and justice, led the opposition questioning on Bill 41, described as a “framework” bill committing the province to dozens of clauses in the UN document.De Jong asked about UNDRIP Article 39, which states: “Indigenous peoples have the right to have access to financial and technical assistance from states and through international cooperation, for the enjoyment of rights contained in this declaration.”Indigenous Relations Minister Scott Fraser said UNDRIP “does not create a positive obligation on the part of the state, but there will be conversations about funding from the provincial government.”B.C. has already signed an agreement to share seven per cent of B.C. Lottery Corporation net income, which the province estimates will amount to $100 million over the 23-year term of the deal.Environment Minister George Heyman has completed a rewrite of B.C.’s Environment Assessment Act, after a consultation tour including mining, forest industry and union representatives.@tomfletcherbctfletcher@blackpress.caLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.BC legislatureGet local stories you won't find anywhere else right to your inbox.Sign up herePrevious storyTrain the Trainer event raises $13,00 for Peace Arch HospitalNext storyB.C. craft cannabis growers wind through layers of governmentJust PostedChamber director hopes Cloverdale area not forgotten when new charging stations installedNew charging stations need be built in Cloverdale, Clayton, and Campbell Heights: Scott WheatleySurrey start for ‘Global Day of Action’ car rally to support farmers in IndiaDeparture from Strawberry Hill on Tuesday, Jan. 26South Surrey/White Rock Learning Centre art show highlights ‘diverse perspectives’With COVID-19 protocols in place, youth art show underwayThere’s help for South Asian men wrestling with drug addiction in SurreySouth Asian deaths related to toxic drugs increased by 255 per cent between 2015 and 2018Surrey councillor says city needs more accessible housingLinda Annis expected to introduce notice of motion to that end at tonight’s council meetingVIDEO: Vintage military plane gets towed from Chilliwack to Greater VictoriaGrumman CP-121 Tracker’s eventual home the British Columbia Aviation Museum on Vancouver IslandMan sentenced to 20 months for sexual offences involving a minor in MissionWill Laws Clark was 22 and victim was 13 at time offences began2nd COVID vaccine doses on hold as B.C. delivery delayed againNew COVID-19 cases slowing in Fraser Health regionIs it time to start thinking about greener ways to package cannabis?Packaging suppliers are still figuring eco-friendly and affordable packaging options that fit the mandates of Cannabis RegulationsB.C. now has three cases of South African COVID-19 variant, six of U.K. strainBoth variants are thought to spread faster than earlier strainsGreat Canadian Gaming CEO resigns after being accused of sneaking into Yukon for vaccineRod Baker and Ekaterina Baker were charged with two CEMA violations eachDoorman of makeshift ‘booze-can’ in Vancouver apartment fined; police look to court orderThis marks the fourth complaint about social gatherings inside the apartment in JanuaryKelowna couple welcomes baby girl from Hotel Zed Nooner campaignNicole and Alex will now have 18 years of free stays at the hotelAbbotsford Tulip Festival is closing, with plans to rebloom in ArmstrongEvent organizer says pandemic and sale of land were factors in decisionMost ReadGreat Canadian Gaming CEO resigns after being accused of sneaking into Yukon for vaccineRod Baker and Ekaterina Baker were charged with two CEMA violations eachDial-in phone program keeps Surrey-area seniors connectedSeniors’ Centre Without Walls has February calendar filled with eventsKamloops Blazer paralyzed in snowboarding accident sparks fundraiser for familyAs of Jan. 24, more than $68,000 had been raised to help Kamloops Blazers’ forward Kyrell SopotykB.C. drivers caught crossing, merging over solid white lines face hefty fineTicket for $109, two penalty points issued under Motor Vehicle Act for crossing solid linesAbbotsford Tulip Festival is closing, with plans to rebloom in ArmstrongEvent organizer says pandemic and sale of land were factors in decisionTrial of Hedley frontman Jacob Hoggard pushed to 2022 in light of COVID-19Pre-trial motions that were scheduled to be heard Monday will now take place in AprilThe end of hugs: How COVID-19 has changed daily life a year after Canada’s 1st caseToday marks the one year anniversary of COVID-19 landing in CanadaExplore Cloverdale ReporterNEWSSPORTSTRENDING NOWBUSINESSENTERTAINMENTLIFECOMMUNITYOPINIONVIDEOSWEATHEROBITUARIESTRAVELMARKETPLACECONTESTSCONTACT USBLACK PRESS MEDIASurrey Now LeaderLangley Advance TimesMaple Ridge-Pitt Meadows NewsPeace Arch NewsNorth Delta ReporterContact UsOur TeamPrivacy PolicyTerms of useSite MapCloverdale NewsCloverdale WeatherCloverdale Classifieds© 2021, Cloverdale Reporter and Black Press Group Ltd.Close ad"
