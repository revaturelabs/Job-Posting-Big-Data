It’s such a relief for them as the uncertainty around income and paying their bills was very stressful.\"We’d like to thank our MP for escalating this issue with the Treasury.\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to play Tap to playThe video will auto-play soon8CancelPlay nowHolbrook Community Society rescued the closed Spotted Cow pub from property developers in 2017, reopened it, opened a separate café and took over the local Post Office business.derbyshireliveFollow @derbyshire_liveMore OnPoliticsEmploymentPubsNewsallMost ReadMost RecentBolsoverDerbyshire police officer bursts into tears while quizzed over WhatsApp photoPC Thomas Warsop is at the centre of a police misconduct hearingHolidaymaker in dark on refund after closure of beauty spot Derbyshire hotelPeak DistrictShe's hundreds of pounds out of pocketHow to apply for £605 monthly benefit linked to stress and anxiety during Covid crisisUK & World NewsPersonal Independence Payment is designed to help towards some of the extra costs of having a long term ill-health condition or disabilityTwo Derbyshire branches of HSBC among dozens facing axe nationallyBelperThey are both due to close this yearPeople warned to avoid Nottingham Road cemetery in Derby because of floodingWeatherAn investigation has started into the causeCoronavirusDerbyshire coronavirus death toll rises by 15 as UK records worst daily death figures so farHere is the latest official dataCorsa driver arrested after trying to 'sneak past police back to his car'SwadlincoteHe thought he'd given police the slip, he was wrongRobber threatens Esso cashier in Chesterfield at knife-pointLocal newsCan you help officers?Derby builder who strangled partner in dream 'was not trying to kill her'CourtsBradley Souto said he was dreaming about cage fighting'Excellent' Derbyshire police officer avoids sack over WhatsApp photo breachBolsoverA panel felt dismissing PC Thomas Warsop would not be necessaryMost ReadMost RecentBolsoverDerbyshire police officer bursts into tears while quizzed over WhatsApp photoPC Thomas Warsop is at the centre of a police misconduct hearingHolidaymaker in dark on refund after closure of beauty spot Derbyshire hotelPeak DistrictShe's hundreds of pounds out of pocketHow to apply for £605 monthly benefit linked to stress and anxiety during Covid crisisUK & World NewsPersonal Independence Payment is designed to help towards some of the extra costs of having a long term ill-health condition or disabilityDerby County making plans amid fears takeover is about to collapseDerby CountyThe Rams were on course to be sold to Deverntio Holidings but the deal has yet to go through with the Rams facing a race against time to complete sale before transfer window closesTwo Derbyshire branches of HSBC among dozens facing axe nationallyBelperThey are both due to close this yearDerby CountyDerby County making plans amid fears takeover is about to collapseThe Rams were on course to be sold to Deverntio Holidings but the deal has yet to go through with the Rams facing a race against time to complete sale before transfer window closesWayne Rooney reveals full effect of Derby County's transfer embargoWayne RooneyThe Rams manager has his target for this January window but he is unable to bring them in as things standWayne Rooney reacts to latest Derby County takeover reportsDerby CountyThe Rams beat Bournemouth 1-0 at Pride Park Stadium amid fresh claims over the protracted takeover'Footballing god' -
