I too had to color my car because of the micro scratches, that occured because of using poor quality car polish sealant. I didn't want to waste money on the garage guy and so after having it colored, I used one of TopCoat F11's kit. They're kinda cool in removing micro-scratches and swirl marks. Just spray on, rub it in and buff it.
