The Service Center will assist Missions with these core elements of the programming cycle, incorporating a host of new policies and procedures instituted by USAID/PPL. These will include, but are not limited to: USAID’s Project Design Guidance, CDCS Guidance, and the Evaluation Policy.The Program Cycle Service Center promotes the view of strategic planning, project design, and evaluation not as discrete, disconnected activities, but as essential components of an integrated programming cycle that allows missions to learn from experience. The PCSC Center helps create the conditions for development success by: (1) facilitating collaboration internally and with external stakeholders; (2) feeding new learning, innovations, and performance information back into the strategy to inform funding allocations, program design and project management; and (3) translating new learning, as well as information about changing conditions, into iterative strategic and programmatic adjustments. Field support is particularly focused on training Junior Foreign Service Officers recruited under the Agency’s Development Leadership Initiative (DLI) in strategic planning, project design, and evaluation.The PCSC is staffed by a team of five persons that are Key Personnel who are subject to USAID review. One of these is the Project Design and Strategic Planning Specialist.In early 2011, USAID updated the Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) Guidance by releasing Version 3. USAID’s CDCSs continue to improve upon the Agency’s long tradition of strategic Planning to define development objectives and maximize the impact of development cooperation. The CDCS process implements the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) and the Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development (PPD-6) which states: “USAID will work in collaboration with other agencies to formulate country development cooperation strategies that are resulrs-oriented, and will partner with host countries to focus investment in key area that shape countries’ overall stabilitiy and prosperity.Also, in December 2011, USAID issued Project Design (PD) Guidance to revitalize the Agency’s commitment to project design fundamentals and maximize the impact of limited resources. Project Design should be informed by evidence, supported by analytical rigor, and consistent across USAID Missions. The Project Design Guidance recognizes that development is highly complex, requiring that the design process itself be responsive to Mission‐specific circumstances, and stresses the need to adapt project implementation based on continual assessing and learning. While the majority of the requests are for CDCS and Evaluation support, demand is starting to shift toward Project Design as more countries with approved CDCS’s turn their attention to operationalizing their new strategies.Primary Duties and ResponsibilitiesThe Project Design and Strategic Planning Specialist will oversee the following support for Project Design and Strategic Planning as part of the Service Center’s Services:• Assisting PPL to market PCSC services to Missions undergoing strategy and project design processes;• Conducting workshops in Washington to USAID staff members in the Program Cycle, particularly as it relates to strategy and project design;• Assisting PPL Analysts, Geographic Bureau, Technical Backstops and Missions to develop the scopes of work for project design and/or strategic planning consultants;• Assisting DLIs and their mentors to develop learning objectives for their experience;• Identifying and supporting consultants approved by PPL for part time, as-needed, project design and/or strategic planning consultancies;• Providing trainers, presenters, and facilitators presentations and handouts for workshops in the field at Missions and/or regional hubs, on how to apply the project design and strategic planning guidance, etc.;• Providing the logistical support for these consultants;• Arranging debriefings for consultants and USAID team members to catalog lessons learned, best practices in design, and design problems that still require solutions, tools and other resources;• Reporting this learning online, often on ProgramNet, in ways accessible to project designers and strategic planners;• Referring remaining needs and problems to PPL for resolution;• Tracking the numbers of USAID staff and DLIs trained and the amount and kind of training and/or mentoring that each has received; and• Deploying to Missions to provide direct assistance in strategy and/or project design.Additional Responsibilities:General• Provide technical and budget reporting as needed, for contract management and Service Center daily operations.• Support the Service Center Manager in collecting best practices and lessons learned and work with USAID’s Compliance and Oversight of Partner Performance (COPP) Division to share these with other partners and Missions.
