Whatta job!!!LikeLikeReplyCarl D'AgostinoApril 6th, 2012 at 21:28Sometimes I have to take orders from them. Hey, no problem !LikeLikeReplySylver BlaqueMarch 31st, 2012 at 22:17Okay, I’ve been watching Ancient Aliens for answers, but now I see that you’re the one to ask! So, what do aliens look like, Officer D’Agostino (what’s your official title?)? Do they look like us?LikeLikeReplyCarl D'AgostinoMarch 31st, 2012 at 22:51For a title I like “your royal majesty” but actually I’m just a captain. Since we are the peculiar ones, the aliens consider us the aliens esp we inhabitants of Miami.LikeLikeReplyHoaiPhaiMarch 31st, 2012 at 06:47Ha-ha! That’s great! I made up space consultant business and ID cards (laminated and everything) for me and my three brothers. We went for a weekend in cottage country and at the general store we put the business cards up on the board right next to the cards offering firewood and stump-pulling services. Funny, we never did get any calls.LikeLikeReplyCarl D'AgostinoMarch 31st, 2012 at 08:11That’s a great gag. Maybe print some as a ghost buster firm.LikeLikeReplyHansiMarch 29th, 2012 at 09:56You look right at home, but a five-some???

Currently I one of my favorite series, too. Kirk, Spock, Smithy, Uhura… I prefer the old ones but the new chapters are Ok.Thanks, Carl.LikeLikeReplyCarl D'AgostinoMarch 28th, 2012 at 13:29Yes each series and cast was special. I always felt that who the actor was for a character was perfectly cast and no one could fit the role as each did in their unique way.LikeLikeReplyCarol Ann HoelMarch 28th, 2012 at 12:42May your first voyage through the Milky Way be hilariously joyful! Keep us posted, Carl.LikeLikeReplyCarl D'AgostinoMarch 28th, 2012 at 13:27This is one job wherein you really have to pay attention.

Being able to discuss poetry and classical literature helps and reading the editorial section and not the sports section is also impressive. I use coconut butter for after shave.LikeLikeReplyMaxiMarch 28th, 2012 at 07:52I have long suspected you were a lady-killer, Carl … you ol’ fox.

Yes they seem to leave it out on cards and account statements and billing and such as it reduces error. They goof and print Carl D. Agostino,Carl D*Agostino, Carl D-Agostino so omitting stops that. On the other hand it helps when they goof up your name on the next arrest report and doesn’t match your prints or record and you get away with it. You have a sharp eye. Can you drive fast? I need a “wheelman” for the next bank job.LikeLikeReplyThe Conservative Hill BillyMarch 28th, 2012 at 11:34I see you have all the galatic gals around you!
