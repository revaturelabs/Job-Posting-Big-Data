Candidates should have a substantive background and active research interests in the social sciences (other than economics), and be domain scientists in that sense. Candidates should also have interest and experience in Data Science methodology, broadly defined, and be using that knowledge to further their research agenda. Examples of techniques and areas with which candidates will be familiar might include supervised and unsupervised learning, pattern recognition, data mining, statisticalmodeling, natural language processing, high performance computing, and using ‘text as data’. A PhD either in one of the social sciences or in a field related to Data Science (such as Computer Science or Statistics) is required, and an ideal candidate would have advanced degrees in both subjects.When discussing their teaching experience, candidates should identify courses they could teach both within and outside their specialty. We expect a high degree of English fluency and clarity of articulation, as for many students who attend NYU Shanghai, English is not their native language. We consider the desire and ability to teach to be as important as research promise.Candidates must have completed a Ph.D. by the time of appointment. Review of applications will begin October 5, 2016, and will continue until the position is filled. The appointment could begin as soon as September 1, 2017, pending administrative and budgetary approval. The terms of employment in NYU Shanghai are comparable to those in U.S. institutions. Faculty may also spend time at NYU New York and other sites of the global network, engaging in both research and teaching opportunities.Applicants should submit curricula vitae, statements of research and teaching interests, electronic copies of up to five recent relevant publications, and the names and addresses of three or more individuals willing to provide letters of reference.
