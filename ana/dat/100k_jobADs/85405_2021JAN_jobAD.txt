And now, that’s exactly what I do.I run a six figure (moving towards seven) business from my laptop. I now have financial, personal and locational freedom.For the first time ever I don’t have to worry about money. I can work to my own schedule and I can be anywhere in the world. And I help people just like me.I’m not saying this to boast, but rather to help you realise I understand exactly where you are and I can take you through the process I’ve been through to help you achieve your own business and dream life.What is Business Bootcamp?Bootcamp came about from my own struggle with so much information and trying to distill what was really important and necessary to get my business flying.You can spend an awful lot of time on things that are all positive, but don’t actually bring in the leads and money – and I did initially.As my business took off, I sat down and considered what the key components for my success were, what were the techniques and tools that made a real, financial difference. And Business Bootcamp was born.Business Bootcamp is an 8 week program with 8 modules and 40 micro- lessons designed to help you develop and grow your business.If you’d like a full outline of what is included download it here.The course opens in July, but I am offering an early bird offer with access to my copywriting makeover included now.
