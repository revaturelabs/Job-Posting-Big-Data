The communication from Sonas throughout the process was excellent. I’d definitely go to Derek again in the future if considering moving on. I have confidence that they would do their best to ensure that the options available are the most suited to me.Richard – Civil Engineer, UKI would recommend Paul and the team at Sonas wholeheartedly. The level of support that they offer from initial contact to final signing of contracts was second to none and made the often daunting task of a successful job application relatively painless. Similarly the practical advice they gave in terms of resume presentation and interview tips was of great benefit.James – QS, LondonI was very impressed with the proactive approach taken by Paul at Sonas from the moment I submitted my application. As I was travelling from overseas for interview he was able to assist me planning travel to and met me just prior to going for the interview to provide some final guidance. A few hours after the interview, Paul had spoken to the employer and was able to offer initial feedback as to how the interview went. Four weeks later and I have started in this excellent role back home with great long-term opportunities.Patrick – Quantity Surveyor, DublinSONAS NEWS // January 19, 2021 An Expected Rise in Irish House Prices of 4% as Residential Properties are in High DemandSONAS NEWS // January 12, 2021 Advanced Building Solutions to be delivered in the midlands between 2021-2024SONAS NEWS // January 7, 2021 “CIF optimistic that the industry is uniquely positioned to return to work safely on 31st January”SONAS RECRUITMENTDUBLIN +353 (0)1 443 3917LONDON +44 (0)20 3286 9422info@sonasrecruitment.comPrivacy Policypic.twitter.com/rz3rtcetSrYesterday at 4:31 pm@sonas_tweetsCOPYRIGHT © 2021 SONAS RECRUITMENT.
