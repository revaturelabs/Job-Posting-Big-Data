Cutting staff will send out entirely the wrong signal to potential students. Axing educators is obscene at any time, let alone during the current uncertainty when we need our universities firing on all cylinders.\"The University of Reading is one institution that has emailed staff to inform them that a voluntary redundancy scheme was being drawn up.The latest financial results for the university show that it made a loss of £20m for the financial year.Meanwhile, the vice-chancellor at Cardiff University, Colin Riordan, has written to staff telling them they will be offered voluntary redundancy from January.Other universities considering cost cutting include Birkbeck College in London, which has a \"voluntary exit scheme\", open for staff, and Bangor University in Wales, which is looking to save £5m.However, some institutions continue to thrive, with the University of Oxford reporting income of more than £1.5bn for the first time, with an overall surplus of £150m for 2017-18.DfE Confirms Tuition Fee Freeze22nd Jan 2021Barings Forward Funds PBSA Schemes21st Jan 2021UCLan Offers Partial Refunds20th Jan 2021NUS Calls for Rent Refunds18th Jan 2021Student Portfolio Up for Sale15th Jan 2021Student Digs Earmarked for Durham14th Jan 2021Student Roost Offers 6 Week Discount12th Jan 2021Student Roost Offers 6 Week Discount12th Jan 2021Tuition Fee Petition Surpasses 200k Signatures11th Jan 2021ResearchNewsList a PropertyTerms & PrivacySite Map© 2021 StuRents Ltd.
