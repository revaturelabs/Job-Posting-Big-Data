Those stories? “They inspire you to do your best every day,” she says. Because Reverb’s userbase is extremely passionate, Carroll and her team are able to gain regular insights from those fans to create solutions that have a tangible impact on musicians around the world.Our users are all connected by a shared love of music, and they’re extremely passionate about what they’re buying and selling.Tasia CarrollUX DesignerGeoff MassanekDirector of EngineeringIMPACT MEASUREDCreating a more musical worldWhether they’re experimenting with search algorithms to help a musician quickly locate the perfect vintage Fender or adjusting Reverb’s “offer” functionality to drive more sales for sellers, Massanek’s team makes sure that the potential impact of their day-to-day work is regularly measured. They follow a pragmatic approach working closely with other teams, deploying dozens of times a day, and routinely testing new ideas.We have the opportunity to understand our users’ behavior, quickly iterate, ship code often, and continuously learn and improve. This helps us get closer to our goal of getting more music gear in the hands of more musicians.Geoff MassanekDirector of EngineeringLydia TrippEngineering ManagerBAND TOGETHERBetter in pairsWhen Tripp’s child was sick recently, she didn’t hesitate to take a few days off to stay home. Reverb embraces a positive work-life balance that extends to its engineering team — no single person is responsible for any single project. Instead, team members pair up on new tasks and learn from what everyone is working on so that if someone is sick or on vacation, another teammate can step in.Work-life balance is built into the culture — employees might need to leave early to record an album or take a week off to tour in Japan. That balance translates to all of us, whether you’re a parent or have passions outside of work.Lydia TrippEngineering ManagerPreviousNextWhat are Reverb Perks + BenefitsReverb Benefits OverviewBeyond free lunches and ping pong tables, we love working at Reverb because we’re making an impact.
