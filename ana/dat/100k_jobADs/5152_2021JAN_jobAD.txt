Too good to be true? One company is working to make it happen.Published6 years agoonApril 7, 2015ByTaylor Leddin, Staff WriterShareTweetOooh, employment – how yummy!The only thing better than a free lunch is ordering your dream job for dessert. While this idea may sound too good to be true, there is a new company working to blend these two facets.Lunchcruit is a brand new company that seeks to match currently recruiting companies with qualified individuals and set them up for conversation over a free-to-the-job-searcher lunch. The set-up provides face-to-face interaction without the pressure of a daunting interview.Read also: Career tip – who you MUST chat with while waiting to interviewThe concept was developed by William Hsu and Dom Patrick and it launched a little over a month ago. Patrick had been working on HackerX which was a speed-dating style platform that introduced startups and developers. During this time, Hsu was working on career analytic sites CodeEval, which he co-founded, and HireVu.However Hsu and Patrick felt that these types of sites, and others including LinkedIn, do not provide the benefits of face-to-face interaction. They explain that the leading way that companies hire, and that people obtain jobs, is through relationships and referrals.Taking the pressure off“It’s just lunch, not recruiting,” according to the Lunchcruit website. The goal is to connect people with organizations with no strings attached. The site writes, “Lunch is an organic opportunity to create meaningful relationships and we think that’s how hiring should be done.”Currently, the system is available for people in Austin, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The website operates by a user typing in their job title and selecting their city. You can filter results by items including: mobile developers, project managers, sales/business, etc.The entire concept is a three-step process:Step one: Find a lunch. As previously stated, you search through the website using your title and city to find a company that sparks your interest.Step two: Request a lunch. After you find a company that catches your eye, you can fill out an application form to plan a lunch. This will then be sent to the company of interest and they will respond back to schedule a date and time.Step three: Go to lunch. Attend your scheduled, no-commitment lunch and hear what the company has to say. Generally, they will explain their organization and new projects they are working on. That way you can get a feel of where you could fit in.On the site’s FAQ page, when asked if it’s really a free lunch, the creators state, “Yes! Companies love throwing free lunches at talented people. Most provide lunches in their office or will take you out!” True or not, the companies using the site appear to be in agreement that they’ll foot the food bill (or have you on site and provide a Happy Meal or whatever).It is an interesting concept that could catch attention if it is well reviewed. Being that Lunchcruit is so new, it’s fate could go either way. Whether or not the idea pans out, you can’t beat a free lunch!#LunchcruitShareRedditSharePinEmailTweet1 SharesRelated Topics:employmentHiringMarketingUp NextCrazy employment ad on Craigslist will probably end in a jail sentenceDon't MissCan your website pass the “drunk user” test?Taylor Leddin, Staff WriterStaff Writer, Taylor Leddin is a publicist and freelance writer for a number of national outlets.

Whatever the reason, some retailers are giving customers a refund and letting them keep the product, too.When Vancouver, Washington resident, Lorie Anderson, tried returning makeup from Target and batteries from Walmart she had purchased online, the retailers told her she could keep or donate the products. “They were inexpensive, and it wouldn’t make much financial sense to return them by mail,” said Ms. Anderson, 38. “It’s a hassle to pack up the box and drop it at the post office or UPS. This was one less thing I had to worry about.”Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Inc., and other companies are changing the way they handle returns this year, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ). The companies are using artificial intelligence (AI) to weigh the costs of processing physical returns versus just issuing a refund and having customers keep the item.For instance, if it costs more to ship an inexpensive or larger item than it is to refund the purchase price, companies are giving customers a refund and telling them to keep the products also. Due to an increase in online shopping, it makes sense for companies to change how they manage returns.Locus Robotics chief executive Rick Faulk told the Journal that the biggest expense when it comes to processing returns is shipping costs. “Returning to a store is significantly cheaper because the retailer can save the freight, which can run 15% to 20% of the cost,” Faulk said.But, returning products to physical stores isn’t something a lot of people are wanting to do. According to the return processing firm Narvar, online returns increased by 70% in 2020. With people still hunkered down because of the pandemic, changing how to handle returns is a good thing for companies to consider to reduce shipping expenses.While it might be nice to keep the makeup or batteries for free, don’t expect to return that new PS5 and get to keep it for free, too. According to WSJ, a Walmart spokesperson said the company lets someone keep a refunded item only if the company doesn’t plan on reselling it. And, besides taking the economic costs into consideration, the companies look at the customer’s purchase history as well.Continue ReadingBusiness NewsGoogle workers have formed company’s first labor union(BUSINESS NEWS) A number of Google employees have agreed to commit 1% of their salary to labor union dues to support employee activism and fight workplace discrimination.Published2 weeks agoonJanuary 7, 2021ByVeronica Garcia, Staff WriterOn Monday morning, Google workers announced that they have formed a union with the support of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the largest communications and media labor union in the U.S.The new union, Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) was organized in secret for about a year and formed to support employee activism, and fight discrimination and unfairness in the workplace.“From fighting the ‘real names’ policy, to opposing Project Maven, to protesting the egregious, multi-million dollar payouts that have been given to executives who’ve committed sexual harassment, we’ve seen first-hand that Alphabet responds when we act collectively. Our new union provides a sustainable structure to ensure that our shared values as Alphabet employees are respected even after the headlines fade,” stated Program Manager Nicki Anselmo in a press release.AWU is the first union in the company’s history, and it is open to all employees and contractors at any Alphabet company in the United States and Canada. The cost of membership is 1% of an employee’s total compensation, and the money collected will be used to fund the union organization.In a response to the announcement, Google’s Director of People Operations, Kara Silverstein, said, “We’ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our workforce. Of course, our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we’ve always done, we’ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.”Unlike other labor unions, the AWU is considered a “Minority Union”. This means it doesn’t need formal recognition from the National Labor Relations Board. However, it also means Alphabet can’t be forced to meet the union’s demands until a majority of employees support it.So far, the number of members in the union represents a very small portion of Google’s workforce, but it’s growing every day. When the news of the union was first announced on Monday, roughly 230 employees made up the union. Less than 24 hours later, there were 400 employees in the union, and now that number jumped to over 500 employees.Unions among Silicon Valley’s tech giants are rare, but labor activism is slowly picking up speed, especially with more workers speaking out and organizing.“The Alphabet Workers Union will be the structure that ensures Google workers can actively push for real changes at the company, from the kinds of contracts Google accepts to employee classification to wage and compensation issues. All issues relevant to Google as a workplace will be the purview of the union and its members,” stated the AWU in a press release.Continue ReadingBusiness NewsTicketmaster caught red-handed hacking, hit with major fines(BUSINESS NEWS) Ticketmaster has agreed to pay $10 million to resolve criminal charges after hacking into a competitor’s network specifically to sabotage.Published3 weeks agoonJanuary 5, 2021ByVeronica Garcia, Staff WriterLive Nation’s Ticketmaster agreed to pay $10 million to resolve criminal charges after admitting to hacking into a competitor’s network and scheming to “choke off” the ticket seller company and “cut [victim company] off at the knees”.Ticketmaster admitted hiring former employee, Stephen Mead, from startup rival CrowdSurge (which merged with Songkick) in 2013. In 2012, Mead signed a separation agreement to keep his previous company’s information confidential. When he joined Live Nation, Mead provided that confidential information to the former head of the Artist Services division, Zeeshan Zaidi, and other Ticketmaster employees. The hacking information shared with the company included usernames, passwords, data analytics, and other insider secrets.“When employees walk out of one company and into another, it’s illegal for them to take proprietary information with them. Ticketmaster used stolen information to gain an advantage over its competition, and then promoted the employees who broke the law. This investigation is a perfect example of why these laws exist – to protect consumers from being cheated in what should be a fair market place,” said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney.In January 2014, Mead gave a Ticketmaster executive multiple sets of login information to Toolboxes, the competitor’s password-protected app that provides real-time data about tickets sold through the company. Later, at an Artists Services Summit, Mead logged into a Toolbox and demonstrated the product to Live Nation and Ticketmaster employees. Information collected from the Toolboxes were used to “benchmark” Ticketmaster’s offerings against the competitor.“Ticketmaster employees repeatedly – and illegally – accessed a competitor’s computers without authorization using stolen passwords to unlawfully collect business intelligence,” said Acting U.S. Attorney DuCharme in a statement. “Further, Ticketmaster’s employees brazenly held a division-wide ‘summit’ at which the stolen passwords were used to access the victim company’s computers, as if that were an appropriate business tactic.”The hacking violations were first reported in 2017 when CrowdSurge sued Live Nation for antitrust violations. A spokesperson told The Verge, “Ticketmaster terminated both Zaidi and Mead in 2017, after their conduct came to light. Their actions violated our corporate policies and were inconsistent with our values. We are pleased that this matter is now resolved.”To resolve the case, Ticketmaster will pay a $10 million criminal penalty, create a compliance and ethics program, and report to the United States Attorney’s Office annually during a three-year term. If the agreement is breached, Ticketmaster will be charged with: “One count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, one count of computer intrusion for commercial advantage, one count of computer intrusion in furtherance of fraud, one count of wire fraud conspiracy and one count of wire fraud.”Continue ReadingAdvertisementOur Great PartnersTheAmerican Geniusnews neatly in your inboxSubscribe to our mailing list for news sent straight to your email inbox.Thank you for subscribing.Oh boy...
