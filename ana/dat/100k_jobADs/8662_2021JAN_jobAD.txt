At that time, it was said that the Hobart staff would grow from 680 to 1430.But the sackings announced today will cut the number of workers from 400 to 300.Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman said Vodafone's decision was devastating and a terrible blow.He has, however, to take back any public funds if Vodafone is found to have broken any of the funding agreements.Vodafone chief strategy officer Dan Lloyd said in a statement said the decision had been taken due to a fall in call volumes and complaints and customers' preference for online self-service.\"We have invested around $200 million in our Hobart contact centre since 2013, and the centre will continue to be a key part of our business,\" he said.A Vodafone Australia spokesperson added: \"On federal funding, this agreement expired in July last year. We returned some funding due for unmet targets.\"We have not received federal or state funding since July last year.\"There is an audit process in place and if any state funding needs to be returned, we will, of course, do that.\"Subscribe to ITWIRE UPDATE Newsletter hereGRAND OPENING OF THE ITWIRE SHOPThe much awaited iTWire Shop is now open to our readers.Visit the iTWire Shop, a leading destination for stylish accessories, gear & gadgets, lifestyle products and everyday portable office essentials, drones, zoom lenses for smartphones, software and online training.PLUS Big Brands include: Apple, Lenovo, LG, Samsung, Sennheiser and many more.Products available for any country.We hope you enjoy and find value in the much anticipated iTWire Shop.ENTER THE SHOP NOW!INTRODUCING ITWIRE TViTWire TV offers a unique value to the Tech Sector by providing a range of video interviews, news, views and reviews, and also provides the opportunity for vendors to promote your company and your marketing messages.We work with you to develop the message and conduct the interview or product review in a safe and collaborative way.
