Marie, recently spoke in the House of Commons to support Motion M-102. The Motion will protect the health of Canadians and support local jobs.Motion M-102 addresses formaldehyde emissions from composite wood products that are sold, provided, or supplied for sale in Canada. Formaldehyde is an irritant, and exposure to high concentrations of the emission has been known to cause burning sensations in the eyes, nose and throat, respiratory problems and cancer.Motion M-102 ensures that foreign composite wood products, that have low environmental standards and high probabilities of formaldehyde, are unable to be liquidated in Canada. Such a scenario would not only place Canadian manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage, but could also significantly impact the health of Canadians.“Arauco-NA is pleased that the Canadian government recognizes the need for a stringent formaldehyde emission standards for engineered wood products being manufactured and or consumed in North America. Arauco-NA already adheres to the highest emission standards in the world (CARB II) and these same emission limits have been adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. This will be a very positive and constructive move by our government and one that will protect our Canadian manufacturing platforms. Without these regulations in place, off shore manufacturers will continue selling non regulated products into the Canadian market place. ” said -Dominic Niro, Plant Manager, ARAUCO – North AmericaOver the last year, MP Sheehan has met with representatives from ARAUCO in Sault Ste. Marie. They discussed the importance of meeting high regulatory standards when manufacturing composite wood products.“I was proud to stand up in the House and fight for the health of Canadians and for the protection of local jobs. ARAUCO in Sault Ste. Marie does an exemplary job of ensuring the health of Canadians and product sustainability remains paramount.” said MP Sheehan.TAGSHealthJOBSsheehanShareFacebookTwitterLinkedinEmailPrintPrevious articleAngry shoveler chases plow for driveway dumpNext articleWanted Wednesday: Shayna Renee NadjiwonContent TeamHi, we're the content team for SaultOnline.
