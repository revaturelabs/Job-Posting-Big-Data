The mounting costs of housing and basic necessities can quickly add up, leaving you scraping to make ends meet rather than saving and building wealth. And depending on where you call home, that situation can be considerably worse.That’s why GOBankingRates conducted a study to identify the annual living wage needed to live comfortably in each of the 50 states, revealing that even if you’re comfortably middle class in one region, that doesn’t mean you won’t be living paycheck to paycheck in another.Not to be confused with the minimum wage, we define the “living wage” as the income you need to cover necessary and discretionary expenses while still contributing to savings. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the 50/30/20 budgeting rule — which allocates 50% of your income to necessities, 30% to discretionary expenses, and 20% to savings — the study found what you would need to earn to comfortably cover your basic needs while still saving for the future. But the results reveal that the average salary in your state might not be enough to do just that.AlabamaAlabamaAnnual Living Wage: $60,016Alabama is among the least expensive places in America to live — in part thanks to median housing costs of just $8,612 a year — but earning a median wage in the state would still leave inhabitants of the Yellow Hammer State $13,544 short of a living wage.The city of Sitka, Alaska at dawn.AlaskaAnnual Living Wage: $91,996Life near the Arctic Circle comes at a cost, with the cost of necessities in Alaska clearing $45,000 a year. That means you would need nearly $92,000 a year to still have half your wages left over for savings and luxuries.Tucson, Arizona, USA downtown skyline with Sentinel Peak at dusk.ArizonaAnnual Living Wage: $68,504Arizona’s cost of living is just 2.3% below the national average so that living wage is very close to what the average rate is nationwide. That said, the median household income in Arizona remains just under $15,000 short of that.Little Rock ArkansasArkansasAnnual Living Wage: $59,461Arkansas is another state where your dollar can stretch the furthest, with a cost of living that’s over 10% under the national average. Many residents of the Razorback State, though, are still struggling to hit that as the average household income is just $43,813 — the second-lowest in the country and nearly $14,000 less than the average American income.Los Angeles California skyline at sunsetCaliforniaAnnual Living Wage: $99,971The nation’s most populous state is also among the most expensive, with a living wage translating to just about six figures if you’re planning on following the 50/30/20 rule. Even for a state with an average annual income of $67,169, those are costs that are hard to bear.Snow covered Longs Peak, part of the Rocky Mountains stands tall in the background with green trees and the Downtown Denver skyscrapers as well as hotels, office buildings and apartment buildings filling the skyline.MoreColoradoAnnual Living Wage: $74,215Life in the Rockies is just a little more expensive than elsewhere — about 4.5% more, to be specific — but the state’s residents appear to be in better shape than most to deal with it. The difference between the median income and the living wage is just $8,757, making it one of just 17 states where that gap is under $10,000.Hartford ConnecticutConnecticutAnnual Living Wage: $90,278Connecticut’s relatively high cost of living means you would need to earn at least $90,000 to cover the average cost of necessities with half your salary. A big chunk of that ends up going to housing, with an average annual bill of $18,485 for Connecticut residents.beach in Lewes Delaware at sunsetDelawareAnnual Living Wage: $71,254While Delaware residents enjoy costs that are generally very close to the average nationwide, they are paying 12% more for their groceries than the average American, translating to an annual bill of nearly $5,000.Jacksonville, Florida, USA downtown city skyline.FloridaAnnual Living Wage: $67,614Although the cost of living in Florida is actually a hair under the national average, the median income in the Sunshine State isn’t quite so sunny at just over $50,000 a year. That leaves a gap of over $16,000 between the typical annual salary and a living wage. Still, Florida has considered one of the best states for the middle class.GeorgiaGeorgiaAnnual Living Wage: $62,074Georgians likely have an easier time making ends meet than most. Their cost of living is below the national average, and while the median income is also relatively low, it’s still “just” $9,097 away from a living wage.Honolulu, Hawaii.HawaiiAnnual Living Wage: $136,437Hawaii is the most expensive state in the country, mostly due to housing costs that run more than triple the national average at about $36,000 a year. As such, despite a median income of nearly $75,000 a year, the typical Hawaiian is still over $61,000 short of a living wage — the largest such gap in this study.Boise downtownIdahoAnnual Living Wage: $66,486Idaho is another state that comes in under the national average for its cost of living, but also has a relatively low median salary for residents to create a large gap between what you need to earn and what people are actually earning. The end result is a median salary that’s more than $15,000 short of a living wage.Chicago IllinoisIllinoisAnnual Living Wage: $66,847Not only are costs lower than the national average in Illinois, but residents there are also earning a median salary of $61,229. That puts the average income just $5,618 below the living wage, among the 10 lowest levels in the study.Indianapolis IndianaIndianaAnnual Living Wage: $62,086Indiana is a relatively cheap place to live, with a cost of living that’s just short of 10 percent below the national average. And while that still leaves them with a higher living wage than what the median Hoosier is earning, Indiana is among those states where the gap is under $10,000.Davenport Iowa cityscape at sunsetIowaAnnual Living Wage: $63,397Iowa can boast relatively low costs of living — including housing costs that are almost 11% below the national average at just $9,552 per annum. That adds up to a median salary that’s just $6,827 short of the annual living wage for the state.Wichita, Kansas, USA downtown skyline at dusk.KansasAnnual Living Wage: $62,090Kansas wraps up a trio of Midwestern states where low median salaries are offset by the low cost of living and puts a living wage in reach for many. With a median salary of $55,477, the typical Jayhawk falls just $6,613 short of a living wage.Louisville, Kentucky, FHA, insurance, real estate, homebuyers, foreclosure, single-family, home median price, mortgage, down paymentKentuckyAnnual Living Wage: $63,086While Kentucky has a low cost of living that’s largely in line with states like Kansas, Illinois, and Iowa, the median salary of just $46,535 is much lower, leaving a $16,551 gap to a living wage despite below-average costs.New Orleans LouisianaLouisianaAnnual Living Wage: $63,842Much like Kentucky, Louisiana has low costs but also lower wages. A median salary in the state is just $46,710, so while residents might be paying almost 15% less for housing than the average American, they’re also more likely to be struggling to afford it.Kennebunkport MaineMaineAnnual Living Wage: $80,336Residents of Maine are much more likely to be struggling with higher costs than the rest of the country. The annual living wage of over $80,000 is among the highest in the country, but the median income there is on the lower side at just $53,024. That leaves a whopping $27,312 gap between a median salary and a living wage, one of the largest in the study.Baltimore, Maryland, USA skyline on the Inner Harbor.MarylandAnnual Living Wage: $92,227Maryland’s living wage of over $90,000 is among the highest in the country. However, many Marylanders can likely take solace in having the earnings to cover it: With a median annual salary of $78,916 — the nation’s highest — the typical earner is just over $13,000 short of a living wage.Boston, MassachusettsMassachusettsAnnual Living Wage: $93,895Massachusetts residents can expect that the cost of their basic necessities will run a full third higher than the national average when totaled, leaving a sky-high living wage of $93,895. And while it’s a state of high earners, the median income of $74,167 is still nearly $20,000 short of being able to fit those costs into a standard 50/30/20 budget.Downtown Detroit skyline reflection on the Detroit River.MichiganAnnual Living Wage: $67,712Michigan is another state in the “low costs but low wages” category, with a cost of living that’s about 10% under the national average but a median annual salary of just $52,668. That means that earning a midlevel salary in Michigan still puts you just over $10,000 a year short of a living wage.Aerial Shot of Downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota at SunsetMinnesotaAnnual Living Wage: $68,944The term “Minnesota Nice” generally refers to its cordial residents, but it could also be talking about the nexus of decent wages and affordable costs in the state. While the cost of living there is slightly higher than the national average — by just 1.5% — the median annual salary of $65,699 is just $3,245 short of a living wage.Biloxi MississippiMississippiAnnual Living Wage: $58,321Mississippi has the lowest cost of living in the country. But before anyone starts throwing any reasonably-priced parties, it also has the lowest median income in the nation at just over $42,000 — that results in a gap of over $16,000.iconic Gateway Arch at sunset in St. Louis MissouriMissouriAnnual Living Wage: $60,858Residents of the Show-Me State might earn less — with a median annual income of $51,542 — but they’re also living somewhere where a dollar goes further. With a cost of living more than 10% under the national average, your typical Missourian is just less than $10,000 a year short of a living wage.Livingston MontanaMontanaAnnual Living Wage: $70,719Some residents of the Big Sky State might grumble that it could just as easily be called the “Big Cost of Living State,” with average annual housing costs that exceed $13,000. That leaves a nearly $20,000 gap between the median annual income of just over $50,000 a year and the average annual living wage.Lincoln NebraskaNebraskaAnnual Living Wage: $65,162While the median annual salary of $56,675 might mean that the typical Cornhusker isn’t exactly rolling in the dough, it’s closer to a living wage than in most states because of a lower cost of living. With annual average housing costs just over $10,000 — about 12% under the national average — a median earner is just $8,847 short of a living wage.Nevada Las VegasNevadaAnnual Living Wage: $75,902Nevada is a relatively expensive state where residents don’t appear to be earning enough to cover costs. All told, that living wage of $75,902 means Nevada is one of the eight states where the median income is $20,000 or less than the living wage.Portsmouth is a city in Rockingham County, New Hampshire.New HampshireAnnual Living Wage: $74,415While the cost of living in New Hampshire drives up its living wage to nearly $75,000 a year, the state also has a lot of residents with higher incomes, leading to a median salary of over $70,000 a year. The resulting gap between the two of just $3,110 is among the lowest in the study despite those high costs.Large group of sailing yachts at the Manhattan Yacht Club marina, off Morris Canal Basin, at Marin Boulevard, Jersey City, New York State, USA.New JerseyAnnual Living Wage: $86,244The annual cost of living in the Garden State is more than 20% higher than the rest of the country as a whole, but that also comes with higher wages in the state, where a median income is a whopping $76,475. So, despite a living wage of over $85,000 a year, the typical resident is still within $10,000 of that mark.dusk city shot in Santa Fe New MexicoNew MexicoAnnual Living Wage: $63,629It doesn’t cost as much to get by in New Mexico, but the state’s very low median income — just $46,718 — means most residents are still probably struggling to make ends meet. That median salary is nearly $17,000 short of a living wage.New YorkNew YorkAnnual Living Wage: $95,724After Hawaii and California, no state is as expensive to call home as the Empire State. And while the median salary there is a healthy $62,765, the $32,959 gap from there to a living wage is second only to Hawaii and Oregon.Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA skyline at dusk.North CarolinaAnnual Living Wage: $64,406Tarheel State residents have significantly lower housing costs than most — costing them under $10,000 a year on average. However, despite this, a low median income in the state leaves the typical resident earning $14,086 less than they need for a living wage.Fargo, North DakotaNorth DakotaAnnual Living Wage: $69,085The annual cost of living in North Dakota is just slightly below the national average, but with a median annual salary north of $60,000 a year, the state’s typical resident is just $7,800 short of a living wage.Downtown Cleveland, Ohio, glows in setting sunlight as the full moon prepares to rise under the pink clouds at center-left.OhioAnnual Living Wage: $63,204Ohioans are facing a similar story as many other states in the study: low costs, but not low enough based on what most residents are earning.

The gap from the median salary to the living wage is still over $10,000 a year.aerial view of Portland OregonOregonAnnual Living Wage: $93,285While Hawaii’s astronomical gap of over $60,000 between its median salary and its living wage is No. 1, the state of Oregon comes in second at $37,166.

The itemized costs of living evaluated were housing, groceries, utilities, healthcare, and transportation, collectively termed “necessities.” Based on each state’s respective cost of living index for each item, sourced from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center’s 2018 Cost of Living Data Series, the study calculated the annual cost of each necessity and summed them up for total annual expenditure on necessities. Using the 50/30/20 budget rule, which allocates 50 percent of income for necessities, the study doubled the total annual expenditure on necessities in order to determine the “living wage” in each state. “Living wage” is defined as the income required to be able to cover 50% necessities, 30% discretionary/luxury spending and 20% for savings.ReactionsYou may like these postsPost a Comment0 CommentsPagesHomeCareer ChangeCollege GradsCover LettersFuture of WorkGender Gap and DiversityGet HiredPersonal FinanceProductivityRecruiting and HiringSide HustlesSkilled At WorkWageWork From Home JobsMust Read3/recent/post-listJust Added3/recent/post-listWhat People Read3/random/post-listStop searching.Start matching.Discover new job opportunities that fit who you are — and who you want to be.
