Jewelry business owners and managers shared these unusual situations.TIL DEATH DO US PART. We made a customer’s “death ring” that she planned to take to her grave because “no one else deserves it but me.” It was a 1-carat heart-shaped diamond with a penguin hugging each side of the heart.GAZE INTO THESE EYES. A London blue topaz and diamond pendant for a cat. I had to match the topaz to the color of the cat’s eyes.LET’S JUST MATCH THE FORK, SHALL WE? We created a piece to hold some ashes from a young couple that were murdered on Christmas Eve. The mother brought in sterling flatwear that were theirs. We made the piece with a design like what was on the flatwear. The challenge was getting the ashes in the piece. I got them in and my jeweler was to solder the opening. He could not get it entirely closed and a tiny bit of ashes would spill out! He finally came down from the shop and declared this is creeping me out! The hole was tiny so we epoxied it!A CANINE’S CANINE. Casting a dog’s tooth for a necklace, but I bet a lot of people have done that one.A NUTTY LOCKET. Most unique of 2019 was a custom 18K gold “life-sized” peanut; think Planters logo, locket that holds two family photos on one side, and nearly 100 pavé diamonds on the other side with a magnetic closure. Gift from husband to wife whom he always called his “peanut.”AdvertisementSTAFF SAYS IT’S ONE OF A KIND. I had a woman come in the store with her boyfriend. She showed me a pendant she wanted that had a couple engaging in sex. She wanted me to make it and said that it had to be moveable with a small lever. I made it and still have the mold. My staff won’t let me make it again. The guy came back and bought an engagement ring as long as the diamond was 0.69 carats. After that purchase, I never saw them again.AND THE PRIZE GOES TO THE MONKEY SKULL. I have done so many weird pieces, it’s hard to say which is weirdest. I have set human teeth (for two different customers), puppy teeth (three different customers, same dog), Tyrannosaurus Rex teeth, pieces of the Berlin Wall (with a barbed wire motif), 10 pieces of rock from the top of Mt. Everest, made a necklace out of pieces of metal removed from a customer after they saved her leg, and appraised a damaged ceremonial monkey skull. Is that enough? I could probably come up with more.A TROPHY. The granny that killed an alligator, who wanted an alligator tooth necklace.TATTOO YOU. We were commissioned to make an engagement ring for which we engraved the sides with an intricate design showing a seedling and vines. It turned out to be a replica of the bride-to-be’s tattoo!LIFE-SIZE REPLICA. Years ago we made a life-sized replica of a guy’s manhood. Cast it in sterling silver. He furnished the wax model. We weren’t interested in making the mold for him.BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. A possum hat pin with ruby eyes.LOFTY GOALS.

Third generation jeweler and owner Rob Briman says the decision wasn’t easy, but the sale that followed was — all thanks to Wilkerson. Briman had decided a year prior to the summer 2020 sale that he wanted to retire. With a pandemic in full force, he had plenty of questions and concerns. “We had no real way to know if we were going to be successful or have a failure on our hands,” says Briman. “We didn’t know what to expect.” But with Wilkerson in charge, the experience was “fantastic” and now there’s plenty of time for relaxing and enjoying a more secure retirement. “I would recommend Wilkerson to any retailer considering a going-out-of-business sale,” says Briman. “They’ll help you reach your financial goal. Our experience was a tremendous success.”You may likeThis Customer Asked To Use The Restroom, Then Cleaned ItBeware Swedish Customers Bearing Goodie BagsThis Customer Exposed an Absence in the StorePromoted HeadlinesRetirement Made Easy with WilkersonWilkersonJewels For Ringing In The New YearGabriel & Co.Holiday Gift Gifting TrendsGabriel & Co.AdvertisementLatestTrendingVideosPress Releases17 hours agoWJA Announces Susan Chandler as the 2021 President-Elect of the International Board of DirectorsPhoto Gallery18 hours agoDe Beers and Blue Nile Collaborate with 10 Women Designers on 10 New Engagement RingsBenchmarks23 hours agoJewelers Shine a Light on Distinctive Fixtures in StoresColumns1 week agoMaria Sharapova Reveals Her Emerald-Cut Diamond Engagement RingShane Decker4 days ago93 Responses To Common Jewelry Sale ObjectionsHeadlines1 week agoPandora Temporarily Closes 25% of Stores Due to COVID-19Sponsored Content2 days agoRetirement Made Easy with WilkersonJimmy Degroot2 weeks agoVideo: January Is the Time to Reflect on Your Jewelry Business and Set GoalsJimmy Degroot4 weeks agoVideo: Sell More Jewelry by Staying in the Moment and Asking This QuestionAdvertisementSubscribeBULLETINSINSTORE helps you become a better jewelerwith the biggest daily news headlines and useful tips.(Mailed 5x per week.)Latest CommentsMost PopularColumns1 week agoMaria Sharapova Reveals Her Emerald-Cut Diamond Engagement RingShane Decker4 days ago93 Responses To Common Jewelry Sale ObjectionsHeadlines1 week agoPandora Temporarily Closes 25% of Stores Due to COVID-19Headlines7 days agoMan Rams Rental Car Into Store, Steals Jewelry, Runs AwayHeadlines1 week agoTiffany Gets New CEO as Acquisition by LVMH ClosesProducts1 week ago56 Percent Of Jewelers Surveyed Report Sales Gains In DecemberCommentary: The Business3 days agoIllinois Store Owner Talks Christmas COVID Bingo, Funny Customer Questions and a Record-Breaking DecemberManager's To Do7 days agoValentine’s Day, Planning Ahead for Spring, and More Manager’s To-Do Items for FebruaryADVERTISE IN INSTORESUBSCRIBE TO INSTOREGET OUR BULLETINSJOIN THE BRAIN SQUADEVENTSCopyright © 2021 Instore Mag.
