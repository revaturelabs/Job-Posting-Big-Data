However, it looks like the summer of 2010 go down in the history books as the recovery that wasn’t.In a June 17th report to Obama from Joe Biden, Biden lays out the activities of the “Summer of Recovery”. This report was vague at best. Noticeably lacking in the report was any hard numbers on expected job creation—a key part to the recovery of the economy.Oddly, the recovery summer fact sheet claims that the impact from the Recovery Act will continue to climb through the end of the year, aided by the “Recovery Summer” projects. However, the predictions outlined in this “fact sheet” fall far short of reality.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 142,221,000 employed Americans in January of 2009 and as of July 31st, 2010, there are 138,960,000 Americans employed. That is a net loss of 3,261,000 employed Americans—an amazing fall in employment over the course of a year and a half!But if you look to Biden’s report on “Recovery Summer”, he claims that the Obama administration plans to create 3.5 million jobs by December 31st, 2010. Compare Biden’s estimate to the trend on the above graph, and what you’ll see is quite different. In fact, it appears that the “recovery” stalled and even began to fall backwards by May of 2010—hardly a good sign of a “Recovery Summer”.Even further, a quick examination of the now all-too common lingo from the Obama administration when they spin their job creation estimates is important to pay close attention to. Far too often they push the “jobs created or saved” line, which amounts to, “we have no idea if what we did resulted in any positive change to the employment situation for Americans.”Economist Veronique De Rugy points out the myth behind the “created or saved” exclamations from the Obama administration in the below chart:As you can see, even where jobs were “created or saved”, the jobs that were lost far offset the administrations’ flashy press releases claiming otherwise. The fact of the matter is that jobs are not being created or saved, jobs are being lost.The “Sumer of Recovery” theme that the White House pushed in June has fizzled. Americans realize that the jobs are not coming. And if the Obama administration thinks that they can keep telling the American people that they are spending their taxpayer dollars to save their jobs, they will need some hard evidence to back up such claims. To date, no such evidence exists.As “Recovery Summer” comes to a close, it is important to remember what has happened. More Americans are out of work now than before the summer “recovery” season began.NRD Editor’s Note: Read more on the Recovery Summer Exposed here.Adam Bitely is the Editor-in-Chief of NetRightDaily.com.SubscribeEmail:FacebookParlerArchivesArchives Select Month January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 July 2008YouTubeSearchLatest StatementsThanks to Operation Warp Speed, 100 million doses in 100 days is a ‘slam dunk’ January 21, 2021Biden Restores Liberal Slush Fund Payouts, Rather than Paying Victims January 20, 2021Trump & Canada Tighten Restrictions on Chinese Investments January 14, 2021Voting to impeach is not heroic January 13, 2021ALG joins Sen.
