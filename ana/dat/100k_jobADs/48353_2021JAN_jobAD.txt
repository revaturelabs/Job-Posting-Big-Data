They are especially careful not to say negative things about a rival’s product or technology when they are working on something along the same lines. Looks like Apple CEO, Steve Jobs, is not that kind of a person and has absolutely no problem making himself and his customers look stupid.Today I came across this article on CNN.com. Apparently, during a 2008 earnings call, Jobs said that Apple could not make a $500 computer that is not a “piece of junk”. This January, Apple came out with the $499 iPad, their answer to the netbook. Now since the netbook is actually a computer (I have successfully managed to install and use SolidWorks 2010 on my Dell Inspiron Mini 10v, among a host of other CAD systems), I am beginning to wonder whether Apple has finally been able to create a piece of junk. Either that or Apple does not consider the iPad to be anything close to a computer.Looks like Jobs has an uncanny habit of pissing on his competition and then dishing out the same piss to his customers. In 2008 he had this to say about Amazon’s Kindle, “It doesn’t matter how good or bad the product is, the fact is that people don’t read anymore. Forty percent of the people in the U.S. read one book or less last year. The whole conception is flawed at the top because people don’t read any more.” And a year later he pulls out the iPad.Hardware takes years to develop, test and get into production. When Jobs was making these statements, he knew exactly what his engineers were up to. So the next time Jobs pisses on something, that should serve as a good indication on the direction Apple is headed.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Related← Is the iPhone an Idiot Phone?The Cloud After The CAD →Recent PostsLeveraging Additive Manufacturing to Reduce Costs3D Printed Mobile Phone StandFDM vs DLPSoldering with Figure 4 HI TEMP 300-AMB MaterialFigure 4 Direct Digital Molding PresentationRecent CommentsPrashant on A Conversation With Vineet Sethjosefa fout on Solid Edge ST4 For Free3D Rendering Company on Design Optimization Using SolidThinking InspireGeorge Ham on SpaceClaim’s Versioned APIPiper St. George2 on How To Get DWG Solids Into Inventor?ArchivesArchives Select Month August 2020 (2) July 2020 (5) June 2020 (4) May 2020 (3) April 2020 (5) March 2020 (3) February 2020 (3) December 2019 (12) November 2019 (6) October 2019 (1) August 2019 (1) July 2019 (1) January 2019 (1) December 2018 (1) November 2018 (5) October 2015 (1) September 2015 (3) November 2014 (2) October 2014 (1) September 2014 (1) August 2014 (1) June 2014 (1) January 2014 (2) November 2013 (3) October 2013 (10) September 2013 (1) August 2013 (6) July 2013 (2) June 2013 (6) May 2013 (4) April 2013 (11) March 2013 (4) February 2013 (2) January 2013 (3) December 2012 (4) November 2012 (10) October 2012 (9) September 2012 (13) August 2012 (9) July 2012 (10) June 2012 (9) May 2012 (6) April 2012 (7) March 2012 (14) February 2012 (11) January 2012 (13) December 2011 (7) November 2011 (14) October 2011 (23) September 2011 (20) August 2011 (16) July 2011 (10) June 2011 (20) May 2011 (32) April 2011 (33) March 2011 (13) February 2011 (7) January 2011 (33) December 2010 (35) November 2010 (44) October 2010 (74) September 2010 (45) August 2010 (68) July 2010 (30) June 2010 (30) May 2010 (32) April 2010 (94) March 2010 (51) February 2010 (53) January 2010 (34) December 2009 (38) November 2009 (31) October 2009 (28) September 2009 (14) August 2009 (15) July 2009 (15) June 2009 (14) May 2009 (23) April 2009 (33) March 2009 (16) February 2009 (14) January 2009 (9) December 2008 (6) November 2008 (14) October 2008 (11) September 2008 (6) August 2008 (4) July 2008 (11) June 2008 (6) May 2008 (11) April 2008 (12) March 2008 (3) February 2008 (8) January 2008 (10) December 2007 (13) November 2007 (5) October 2007 (14) September 2007 (9) August 2007 (13) July 2007 (5) June 2007 (9) May 2007 (3) April 2007 (2) March 2007 (8) February 2007 (16) January 2007 (15) December 2006 (6) November 2006 (5) August 2006 (1)Categories3D PrintingEventsFeaturedInterviewsNewsOpinionsOthersPersonalReviewsMetaLog inEntries feedComments feedWordPress.orgCopyright © 2021 Deelip.com.
