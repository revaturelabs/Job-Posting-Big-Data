That's naturally going to lead to an almighty backlash.However, with the Sports Direct dictatorship coming to a long-awaited end, Bruce has a chance to make amends with fans. Instead of being Ashley's puppet on a tightly-wound string, he can be the boyhood Newcastle fan who will give his blood, sweat and tears for the club he loves.Admittedly, Newcastle have been pretty terrible to watch this campaign. In fact, no team has scored fewer goals (25), while they are 17th out of 20 for total shots in the ​Premier League this season. But if you scratch the surface then you'll quickly realise that Bruce hasn't done all that bad with what he's got at his disposal.Bruce has been incredibly unlucky with injuries this season, often having a horde of his best and brightest in the treatment room at any given time.Allan Saint-Maximin - who has proven to be one of the most chaotic and exciting players in the Premier League this term - has suffered persistent setbacks just as he starts to get up to speed, while almost every single member of Bruce's defence has been missing for significant periods, including another astute Bruce summer loan signing Jetro Willems who suffered a season-ending injury in late January.Meanwhile, Bruce has also had to put up with four strikers who have been utterly woeful at finishing their chances this season - most notably Joelinton, who seems to be genuinely just awful at football.Yet, Newcastle sit 13th in the Premier League table, eight points off the relegation zone, and have taken points off Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United this season.It could be a whole lot worse, eh?Now, don't get us wrong, it's still unlikely that Bruce will be the Newcastle manager for the next ten years or so, especially considering the likes of Max Allegri, Mauricio Pochettino and Lucien Favre have already been linked with his job. But the man deserves a chance to change his ways at the very least.Maybe with some serious investment in some top-quality players Bruce can ditch his negative tactics and regressive philosophy, instead forging a new path for Newcastle with improved resources.Give the former Hull manager some money to spend, as well as a free pick of some world-class players, and there's little doubt that results - and performances - will improve significantly.While casting poor Bruce aside may be the easy and convenient option, it certainly doesn't guarantee success.Related Topics:Premier LeagueNewcastle UnitedTop StoriesFanVoiceTransfer NewsDavid Moyes keen to overhaul West Ham's transfer strategy in bid to awaken 'monster club'Frank Lampard reveals his long-term plans for Ruben Loftus-CheekBayern Munich turn to Eder Militao as possible David Alaba replacementMinute Media 2019 90min © All rights reservedTerms & Conditions"
