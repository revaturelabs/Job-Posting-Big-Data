I can handle all mixing / mastering, etc... All I ask is that the recordings be as high quality as possible. Generally the way I do this is let the artist (you) come up with some ideas and do some demo recordings and then I usually ask for a few tweaks here and there based on what I hear. I can offer assistance with writing as well. Please reach out with any questions! Thanks, James Are you looking to pay or is this a collaboration?
