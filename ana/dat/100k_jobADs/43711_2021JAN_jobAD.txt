It offers fantastic value for money. While we didn’t have many applicants we found the the CV database an excellent facility. You simply pick the candidate you think might be suitable and send them an e-mail. It is early days yet but we are hopeful that the person we have hired will turn out to be our best salesperson yet!!!I hope I won’t have to go back for a while but I would definitely use salesjobs.ie again.Michael CullinanFinancial ControllerSF EngineeringPrevious ArticlesPlease click here to view all news articlesLatest JobsLatest Sales JobsHealthcare Development Manager - Advanced Wound Care Competitive *Healthcare Development Manager - Advanced Wound Care - Republic of Ireland* Our client is a highly regarded Healthcare company that specialise in the Wound Care/Negative Pressure marketpla...Design Consultant (Sales) Kitchen Industry - to €100K OTE - Galway Galway Competitive Salary Offered - see below Alex Jane Bespoke living are now recruiting for a hardworking, enthusiastic candidate to join our growing company and become part of the vision.Are you a career driven design consultan...Design Consultant (Sales) Kitchen Industry - to €100K OTE - Cork Cork Competitive Salary Offered - see below Alex Jane Bespoke living are now recruiting for a hardworking, enthusiastic candidate to join our growing company and become part of the vision.Are you a career driven design consultan...Design Consultant (Sales) Kitchen Industry - to €100K OTE - Kildare East Ireland Competitive Salary Offered - see below Alex Jane Bespoke living are now recruiting for a hardworking, enthusiastic candidate to join our growing company and become part of the vision.Are you a career driven design consultan...Agri Counter Sales (Cavan) East Ireland DOE FRS Recruitment is partnering with a leading Agri Retailer for the role of 'Agri Counter Sales' based in North, Co.
