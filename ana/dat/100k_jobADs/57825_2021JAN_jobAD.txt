Those short-term are aimed at addressing the supply aspect of the economy, whilst the long-term will focus on attracting and boost investment. As a Government we will stand should to shoulder with our business community. We are aware of the challenges that the community is facing, bearing in mind that despite that shops are now open for business, their activity certainly is not at the same level as was experienced prior to the pandemic. With our finger firmly on the pulse of businesses, as a Government we will guide businesses through this new phase in order to reduce their burdens as much as possible and safeguard jobs whilst creating new ones, a stance which complements our drive to seek opportunity in adversity and lead the way to re-experience economic growth,’ said Minister Schembri.Minister Schembri said that the wage supplement will be provided for the month of June and Malta Enterprise will continue with its routinely process in assisting businesses.It was explained that an amount of €55 million has been disbursed so far as part of the COVID-19 Wage Supplement.
