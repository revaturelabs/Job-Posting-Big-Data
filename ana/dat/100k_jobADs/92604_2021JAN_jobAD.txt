Some said jobs could be filled by migrants, while others warned that approach was naive. A new study has the facts, reports Marion MacGregor/InfoMigrants.Large numbers of working migrants in Germany are in skilled jobs, according to a new study.The Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW), a German employer group, looked at employment figures for new migrants from eight main countries of origin – Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria.The study found that about 14,000 of this category of migrants are in formal work. Of those, around 60 per cent have skilled jobs. More than 9 per cent work in professions that generally require at least a diploma or master’s degree.420,000 migrants seeking jobsThe study is based on data from the German employment agency, the Bundesagentur für Arbeit. At the end of November 2017, 420,000 refugees were registered there as job-seekers. 175,000 were registered as unemployed. The remainder were enrolled in integration or language courses or were completing courses through the employment agency.The data show that a large proportion – three quarters – of migrants in work is employed by small and medium-sized businesses, rather than with bigger firms.The study also found that most of the migrants in work are Syrians, followed by Afghans, Iraqis and Iranians. Of those from Afghanistan, more than half are working in high-skilled professions.As of the end of March 2017, IW figures show that nearly a fifth of working migrants in lower-skilled jobs were employed in the service economy – as security guards, building supervisors, gardeners and landscapers. Nine per cent were with temporary work agencies, around 17 per cent worked in hospitality, 12.4 percent in business, and over 10 percent in health and social services.IW researchers say they expect the proportion of migrants who can only find unskilled jobs – now 40 per cent of those from the main countries of origin – to grow in the future.ShareFacebookTwitterGoogle +LinkedInPrevious Donald Trump’s Presidency and Africa, One Year OnNext George Weah: From international football superstar to an African presidentRelated Articles2,170 people die trying to reach Spain – NGOJanuary 4, 2021Ghana: Maisha holds awareness workshop for women and girls on irregular migrationDecember 29, 2020Germany: President Steinmeier’s Christmas message of hope, solidarityDecember 24, 2020Mama Prosper laid to rest amid wailing in FrankfurtDecember 14, 2020Germany: Most women in protective shelters have migration backgroundDecember 11, 2020Senegal: Fathers sentenced to jail for pushing their sons to migrateDecember 10, 2020Germany: Nigerian embassy sacks official over sex-for-passport video scandalDecember 8, 2020Book: Ghanaians in Germany – Past, Present and FutureDecember 5, 2020Germany: New laws and regulations in December 2020December 4, 2020Nigeria’s anti-human trafficking agency gets new headDecember 2, 2020Germany: Bundesrat approves increase in unemployment and child benefitsDecember 1, 2020Court: Deportations to Nigeria and Gambia breach European ConventionNovember 30, 2020Give us your opinion about hair and skin care products and win €80 worth of care products!November 27, 2020France to reduce visas for countries refusing to take back their nationalsNovember 23, 2020Germany: Report corrupt officials – Nigerian Embassy chargesNovember 20, 2020Deportation: Germany risks spreading coronavirus in Nigeria – Group allegesNovember 19, 2020Germany: Persons to be deported cannot be arrested in the night – Court rulesNovember 19, 2020Switzerland should not deport Gambian homosexuals – European court rulesNovember 19, 2020Germany: Sex-for-passport scandal engulfs Nigerian Embassy in BerlinNovember 18, 2020Libya: UN condemns killing of asylum-seeker in TripoliNovember 14, 2020UN appoints Nigerian as chair of anti-human trafficking bodyNovember 14, 2020Netherlands cracks down on Ugandan asylum seekers over ‘fake’ LGBT claimsNovember 11, 2020Bundestag approves new requirements for German identity cardNovember 9, 2020Lead Academy: Application closes on 15 November, Apply now!!November 9, 2020Libya: 1,000 migrants intercepted at sea and returned to Libya in 3 daysNovember 7, 2020The Unbearable Predicament for LBGT Asylum-Seekers in the UK and EuropeNovember 6, 2020Germany to remove the word “race” from the Constitution – Justice MinisterNovember 2, 2020140 Senegalese migrants drown after Spain-bound boat sank in deadliest accidentOctober 30, 2020Coronavirus: “Please stay at home,” Merkel pleads again amid record infection numbers in GermanyOctober 25, 2020Young African professionals making it big in GermanyOctober 22, 2020Berlin offers financial aid to churches and mosques over corona crisisOctober 21, 2020Coronavirus pandemic hitting immigrants in Germany hard – Integration Minister warnsOctober 21, 2020Controversial court verdict over Pegida attack on Pakistani in DresdenOctober 18, 2020Check AlsoGermany’s highest court rules in favour of African asylum-seekerThe BVerfG ruled that the woman's asylum request, which she submitted in 2016, was \"patently well-founded\" considering her status as the descendant of members of the slave casteFind us on Facebook	SUBSCRIBESign up to get our free weekly Newsletter!EmailMarketing CommunicationHumanitarian Project: Promo­­ting Safe Migration in AfricaSeeking Asylum in GermanyNews, information and analysis about the situation of asylum-seekers in GermanyAfrika kommtRecent PostsAfrica faces huge hurdles to obtain Covid-19 vaccineALM: WHO’s Tedros Ghebreyesus, Ghana’s Akufo-Addo, Mo Ibrahim Emerge WinnersGerman eLearning platform reaches 1 Million African youth in first yearCOVID-19: New entry rules for travellers to GermanyUganda: International personalities back Bobi Wine, call for free elections© 2021 by African Courier MediaFlankenschanze 4 │ D-13585 Berlin │GermanyTel.: +493023007440 │ Fax: +493023007441 │ info@theafricancourier.de"
