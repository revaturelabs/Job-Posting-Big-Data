Late payment2. Late filing3. Inaccurate tax return4. Unpaid taxes5. Not filing at all6. Underreporting income7. AuditsThese issues are considered major inconveniences, but you can also be summoned due to minor problems. These include unsigned returns, improper forms sequence, overpaying, missing W2 forms, wrong line entries, misdirected tax forms, missing or incorrect Social Security Numbers, incorrect address, and math errors.Being summoned for multiple violations is also possible, and you could be given penalties as well, which is an additional burden.

This way, you can rest assured that your taxation matters will be resolved as efficiently as possible.Some of the options to settle your dispute with the IRS is through the following:Offer in compromise. Most taxing authorities tend to accept this kind of offer as a resolution to your tax problem. However, this only happens when the total amount you proposed to settle your tax problem is equivalent to or surpassing your Reasonable Collection Potential.Full payment. Especially with issues like underpayment or non-filing, it is necessary to pay the full amount indicated on your tax notice to avoid any more trouble. When doing this, it is important to stay calm and professional. Working with an IRS lawyer is even more recommended since they know how to exactly prepare the necessary legal papers and actions.Payment plan. If full payment is not feasible for your financial situation, don’t hesitate to negotiate with the IRS to set up an effective payment plan. Terms and conditions may apply. It is best to get an IRS attorney’s service since they can handle the negotiations and give you the most appropriate payment plan for your situation.Double-check tax details. This solution applies to minor issues like incorrect address, math errors, and the likes—double-check whenever you fill-up necessary information to avoid the same mistakes. Simple or honest mistakes may even prove to be burdensome if you are required to submit the same pile of documents or an investigation occurs.File a bankruptcy. This resolution is not for everyone. There are qualifications that you should meet for you to be able to file for bankruptcy. When you are qualified, the unbearable amount of your back taxes, penalties, and interests that you’re worrying about will be eliminated.Keep a copy of your IRS record. This is crucial to ensure that you won’t be scammed for an alleged tax violation. This will also be useful in analyzing all your available options in solving your current tax issue. Doing this will also help in preventing future tax problems.Best El Jobean IRS LawyerSometimes, tax allegations cannot be resolved with the aforementioned options.
