It would have risen were it not for half a million people who were away from work and receiving no pay - but who said they believed they still had a job, and thus count as employed according to international guidelines.A rise in people who were not looking for work also pushed down on the jobless rate.Most economists polled by Reuters had expected the rate to rise to 4.2%.Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the data represented \"the calm before the storm... but as the Job Retention Scheme unwinds in coming months, the full impact of the recession on unemployment is likely to be revealed.\"Finance minister Rishi Sunak plans to phase out the scheme by the end of October. Last week he announced 30 billion pounds of new measures to stem an expected surge in unemployment.Since then a string of companies have announced layoff plans ranging from private security firm G4S to retailers Boots and John Lewis.A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce showed 29% of companies expected to lay off staff in the third quarter.\"It's clear that we're in the middle of a severe economic downturn,\" Sunak said after Thursday's data. \"As I said last week, we will never accept unemployment as an unavoidable outcome.\"Story continuesBritain's budget forecasters say the unemployment rate could rise as high as 13% this year, exceeding a previous post-war high of 11.9% set in 1984.The ONS said the number of people in employment in the three months to May fell by the most since 2011, down 126,000, driven mostly by self-employed people.But the fall was only about half as severe as the median forecast in a Reuters poll.The number of people claiming Universal Credit welfare unexpectedly fell in June by 28,100 to 2.631 million, but remained more than double its figure in March. The figure includes people who are in low-paid work.The number of vacancies fell in the three months to June to the lowest level since records began in 2001 at 333,000.But a monthly breakdown showed a slight increase in vacancies in June alone.Similarly, hours worked slumped to a record low average in the March-May period, reflecting the job retention scheme. But weekly data showed signs of a slight pick-up recently.The data also showed a hit to pay reflecting how most people on job retention scheme receive 80% of their pay.Average total pay, including bonuses, fell by an annual -0.3%, the first negative figure since 2014 and its biggest fall since 2009.(Reporting by William Schomberg, editing by David Milliken and Hugh Lawson)TRENDINGPinkNewsGenerous Phillip Schofield offers to pay pensioner’s huge energy bill after money troubles leave her unable to eat or sleepPinkNews·3-min readThe GuardianDonald Trump isolated and enraged ahead of Biden inaugurationThe Guardian·6-min readCosmoThe Queen and Prince Philip are moving houseCosmo·2-min readThe IndependentKayleigh McEnany leaves White House after final two-minute press briefing following deadly Capitol riotThe Independent·2-min readEvening StandardSon of Only Fools and Horses actor Nicholas Lyndhurst died of rare brain condition, his family revealEvening Standard·2-min readLatest storiesEvening StandardUK Coronavirus LIVE: New Brazilian variant ‘likely’ already in the UK as Keir Starmer suggests stronger lockdownThe highly-infectious new Brazilian variant of coronavirus is likely to already be in the UK, a Government scientist has warned. While the UK is set to face short-term delays in delivery of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine as the pharmaceutical company upgrades its production capacity, it has been announced. It comes as the UK's aviation sector says it will need \"urgent\" government support if it is to survive another long period of travel curb, after the UK announced all travel corridors will be suspended from 4am on Monday.8 hours agoThe IndependentTrump news - President wants ‘military’ sendoff as top Democrat says ex-staff cannot salvage reputationsAll the latest from the White House and beyond on 16 January 20213 hours agoThe TelegraphBritain will be able to vaccinate nation against new Covid strains within months after new super-factory opensBritain will be able to vaccinate the entire nation against dangerous new Covid strains within four months after a £158m super-factory opens later this year, The Telegraph can disclose. Dr Matthew Duchars, chief executive of the Vaccines Manufacturing Innovation Centre (VMIC), revealed the Oxfordshire facility will be capable of producing 70m doses of an emergency vaccine manufactured entirely on British soil. The news comes amid fears that a new Covid strain from Brazil may prove resistant to current vaccines. All travel corridors into the UK were scrapped this week to prevent new variants entering the country. “We’ll be able to make 70 million doses within a four to five month period, enough for everyone in the country, when we open late this year,” Dr Duchars told The Telegraph. “New Covid variants are absolutely part of the thinking. We probably will need to make seasonal vaccine variants because there may well be mutations in the virus, as well as vaccines for other diseases. You never know what’s coming next.” Currently under construction at the Harwell Science & Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire, the VMIC was first conceived in 2018 and originally planned to open in 2022. When the Covid pandemic struck, the UK government pumped a further £131 million into the not-for-profit company to bring the project forward by a year. The centre is already helping to manufacture the Oxford vaccine by lending expertise and giant bioreactors to the AstraZeneca team and its partners. This week Sir Mene Pangalos, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at AstraZeneca, told MPs that the UK’s lack of manufacturing capacity had been a major stumbling block in the development of the Oxford vaccine, and urged ministers to “urgently address” the issue. Much of the Pfizer and Oxford vaccine doses currently being rolled out in the UK are made in factories in Belgium and the Netherlands. Dr Duchars said the VMIC would be equipped to produce different types of vaccines including MRNA varieties like the Pfizer jab and adenovirus-based technology like the Oxford AstraZeneca jab. “Covid came a year early for us, unfortunately,” he said. “But when we open we’ll have a sovereign capability to manufacture different types of vaccines and still be able to make a large number of doses. “It is a challenge. But that's what we're shooting for. If you don't set yourself a tough target, then there's no chance you can reach it.” He added how the company and its new super-factory could also be used to help developers of numerous other vaccines - not just those targeting Covid-19 - from private and public organisations, whether academic institutions or foundations or private laboratories. Explaining how he believes it is “absolutely remarkable” the vaccine has been developed so quickly, he said: “We may not have a facility that's built and ready to go. But we do have people who understand how to develop and manufacture vaccines. “So, we've essentially lent them out to organisations to help them with the scale up and manufacturer of COVID-19 vaccine.” “And we've been working with lots of those different organisations to help really accelerate and speed up and provide surety and expertise around how to get this vaccine made quickly.” He said the new centre is “technology agnostic”, meaning it can be adapted to different methods for different types of vaccine and viruses. “What we didn't want to do was make a facility that would be great for making the AstraZeneca vaccine, for example, but then next year a different MERS [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome] or SARS [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome] comes along.” he added. “That's a different type of platform and a different vaccine. So we've got to have a flexible facility that is able to make in an emergency a large amount of doses from different types of processes.”9 hours agoYahoo News UKDoctors told to bin leftover vaccines instead of administering second dosesGPs have reportedly been warned by local health authorities that they cannot use extra doses on staff or any patients who have already received their first jab.9 hours agoReutersForty seven players quarantined after COVID-19 cases on Australian Open flightsForty-seven players have been forced into two weeks of hotel quarantine in Melbourne after three coronavirus infections were reported on two chartered flights carrying them to the year's first grand slam, the tournament organisers said on Saturday.

Prof John Edmunds, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the virus tends to mutate in areas where many people have had it. The South African and Brazilian variants emerged among populations who had already developed some resistance to the virus, he said, and it may be evolving in order to \"evade the immune response\". \"In parts of South Africa where the South African variant arose, there was probably quite a high level of immunity in the population at the time,\" said Prof Edmunds. \"That's also true of the Brazilian variant that we're really concerned about. There's good data to suggest that in Manaus there was high levels of immunity at the time it arose.\" The South African variant was first spotted in Britain in December. There are two Brazilian variants. One – known as P.1 – was detected circulating in Manaus, northern Brazil, by scientists in December. This is the one the government is most concerned about. A second one - known as P.2. - has been spotted 11 times in Britain and carries a mutation which can bypass antibodies.15 hours agoThe TelegraphAll over 18s could have vaccine by 'end of June'Every adult in Britain will be vaccinated by the end of June, senior Government figures hope, as they grow increasingly optimistic they will be able to accelerate the rollout. The Telegraph can reveal Whitehall sources believe this target could now realistically be achieved as they plan to vaccinate four to five million people a week within months. A further two vaccines in the pipeline, from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, could help Britain speed up the process to vaccinate all 54 million adults. A source said: \"All over-18s by June – yes.\" They added: \"It is delivery, delivery, delivery.” While senior Government figures are now privately working to this target, the Department of Health – which said it hoped to have vaccinated \"tens of millions\" of Britons by April – are reluctant to publicly acknowledge a deadline. Separately, the chief executive of Britain's new £158 million Government vaccine factory in Oxfordshire told The Telegraph it will be able to vaccinate the entire nation against dangerous new Covid strains within four months when it opens in full by the end of the year.5 hours agoEvening StandardSon of Only Fools and Horses actor Nicholas Lyndhurst died of rare brain condition, his family revealThe mother of teenage actor Archie Lyndhurst has revealed he died from a brain haemorrhage while he slept at his family home in west London.
