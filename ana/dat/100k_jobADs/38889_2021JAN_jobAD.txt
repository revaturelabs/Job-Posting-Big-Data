We interviewed 5 other applicants and he was the most qualified, interesting, and knowledgeable.

Thank you so very much!\"Donna - Manager, Diamond Bar Auto - \"You provide a great service and we still have plenty of resumes to go through to hire another technician like we already have from your service. It is a very important mission you fulfill, since the industry is in such a flux. To predict the future and what changes we need to start making right now to keep profitable and still provide an affordable, quality service would put us at the top of the heap. My opinion is that employees are the resource to really invest in right now - education, benefits, great working environment, etc. How to provide that as an independent and not go bankrupt is the trick.
