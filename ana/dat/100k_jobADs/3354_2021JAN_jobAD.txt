And our unemployment figures are the worst in Australia.“The Premier is more focused on delivering a Budget surplus in October. Only the Liberal Party has a plan for creating jobs.“If elected we will ensure this major project proceeds because it will deliver local jobs, local investment and road safety benefits at minimal cost.“Unlocking the full potential of Wangara estate will create jobs and provide valuable road safety outcomes for the local community.“Population increases in suburbs such as Pearsall, Madeley, Darch, Landsdale and surrounds are adding extra pressure to the local road network and creating major safety concerns.“Wangara is one of Perth’s busiest industrial areas – home to more than 1000 businesses and employing more than 8000 people – so busting congestion there is vital.”Ms Harvey said the McGowan Labor Government had neglected this valuable area of the northern suburbs.Gnangara Road re-alignment for local jobs and fixing congestionMy team's plan to create local WA jobs means getting on with congestion busting road projects like Gnangara Road re-alignment and roundabout in partnership with the City of Wanneroo.This project will unlock the full potential of Wangara industrial estate, creating jobs and improve road safety for the local community.Local residents and businesses will benefit from safer and less congested roads, which is also good for jobs and the economy.Posted by Liza Harvey on Friday, 3 July 2020Authorised by S.Calabrese, Liberal Party, 2/12 Parliament Place, West Perth WA 6005.Share ThisFacebookTwitterLinkedInPrint Friendly"
