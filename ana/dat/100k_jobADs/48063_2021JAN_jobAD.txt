Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, the company is still on track to match the turnover it saw in 2019. An increase of tangible assets aside, it also gained intangible ones in the shape of the Muovo Job Board and Employer Director and a new website which is to be launched in 2021. Broadwing also boasted an increase in new clients and candidates as well as increased web and social media traffic and engagement.A HOT new Job Board & Employer Directory – Muovo by Broadwing RecruitmentUtilising extensive industry research, competitive analysis and a marriage of the different skills and expertise brought to the table, the Broadwing team was able to build a successful recruitment business and a strong brand from scratch in a short period of time.
