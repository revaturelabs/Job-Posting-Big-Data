However, most of these ask for at least a few years of relevant accounts experience, which I don't have. Is it worth continuing with Level 3 or should I take a break?0CommentsKoopaCooper London, UKMAAT, AATQB Posts: 227December 2019Hi @Jammydodger, I was in a very similar position to you - when I started looking for work in this field I had no relevant work experience and only completed level 2.My advice - yes, it's completely worth carrying straight on into level 3; by maintaining my momentum, I showed potential employers that I was committed to my career plan, and actually I found that interviews came a lot more easily once I completed level 3 as well. When you don't have any relevant experience, you need something to make up for it, and qualifications are the best way I can think of doing that!(Actually, I got hired the same week I started level 4, it was already paid for and everything. If I hadn't been hired I would still have gone ahead with it anyway to show that I was sticking to my career plan)I wish you all the luck for 2020!Accounts Executive, ғɪᴀʙ ᴍᴀᴀᴛQBO & Xero certified advisorAATLevel 2 Certificate in Accounting - 17 Jun 2015Level 3 Diploma in Accounting - 22 Jan 2016Level 4 Diploma in Accounting - 19 Dec 2017MAAT - 27 Mar 2018ACCAAdvanced Diploma in Accounting and Business...F4 Corporate and Business Law - 4 Jun 2019F5 Performance Management - 15 July 2019F6 Taxation (United Kingdom) - 3 Dec 2019F8 Audit and Assurance - 2 Mar 20200accountaholics Registered Posts: 10January 2020My best advice for you is to go to an accounting firm and have a solid experience for 3 year. As I remember, they do not require any experience to those who are applying and they even recommend fresh grads to apply to their firm. Happy new year to you.0Pian32 MAAT Posts: 303January 2020My situation was similar. I finished my level 2 and started my level 3. Didn't get much response to applications for about 5 months. I ended up asking a local accountancy firm if I could get some work experience as I was worried about being over qualified and under experienced.Did the week and then was immediatly hired as a temp which changed to full time at the end of that year.Get your foot in the door when you hit about 6 months of experience you'll start to be contacted as long as your CV is visable.AAT Level 4, MAATACCA in progressF4- Passed Aug 2020F5- Planned for Dec 2020F6- Passed Sep 2020F7F8F90amurray Feels At Home Registered, MAAT, AATQB Posts: 304January 2020Hi Jammydodger,I agree with the comments raised above in continuing with your Level 3 studies, showing a continued commitment to your studies would be very attractive to any potential future employer.
