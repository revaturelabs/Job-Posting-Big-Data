"Steve Jobs, 1955 – 2011Skip to contentWishing you all kinds of goodness…Menu	welcome to DuffyBrook.comrecent workphotographyabout & contactPosted on October 5, 2011 October 5, 2011 by duffySteve Jobs, 1955 – 2011Wired wrote a great article. And I love these quotes:“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life,”Jobs said. “Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the resultsof other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinionsdrown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage tofollow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what youtruly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”“No one wants to die, even people who want to go to Heaven don’t want to die to get there,” he told the Stanford graduates [Stanford Commencement Speech, 2005]. “And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It’s life’s change agent; it clears out the old to make way for the new … Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.”I can only add my gratitude. He changed my life for the better with everything he did.CategoriesApplePost navigationPrevious PostPrevious Buddy TimeNext PostNext An iPad – iCloud – iMac WorkflowHi.You can read more about me here, but this is pretty much all you need to know.I...provide strategic web consulting.design and build websites.am an Apple Mac geek.enjoy taking pictures.*live in (& love) Durango, CO.like to ride my bicycles.enjoy helping people.sail whenever possible.If you want to work with me, give me a call. 970-403-5433.Thanks for stopping by.*I took all the photos on this site unless otherwise noted.life rocks© 2009-2020 duffybrook.comAll rights reserved.All photography by me, Duffy.If you like something you see, please don't steal.
