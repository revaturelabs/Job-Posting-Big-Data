So, a year later, at the start line of this years Abbey Dash, I did take a moment to wonder where it had all gone wrong and how I'd ended up dong this run again!!! With nearly 10,000 other runners, Emma and I challenged ourselves to dash to Kirkstall Abbey and back to Leeds as fast as we could. Emma was looking for a new PB (personal best to all you non-runners out there) and I wanted to raise money for a charity project I have been working on all year. I have done a couple of charity events through the year, to support Hope HIV who help children in Africa who have been orphaned by AIDS. It was certainly a tougher run than I remember it being last year (maybe down to my reduced training regime!) and there was definitely more 'never again' declarations at the end. However, our speedy Emma (Tommo) 'smashed' her PB by 20 seconds, finishing in just 56.33 and I raised another £110 for the HopeHIV project - www.the12in12.com, so it was smiles all round. A MASSIVE thank you to those who continue to support me in this very worth while cause. Also, thanks to our Teejay Jones from our sister company Network Marketing who got up early on a Sunday (with a ghastly hangover I am told!) to stand at the side of the road and give us some encouragement. Here's a little 'before' picture...(you weren't expecting one 'after' were you?)Bring on the Abbey Dash 2013!
