"Nathan Humbert's Blog: Make scheduled jobs in heroku safer for your wallet.Nathan Humbert's BlogPseudorandom thoughts, mostly on programming and web application development.Thursday, March 15, 2012Make scheduled jobs in heroku safer for your wallet.I recently checked my current usage on Heroku to find that I had used a much higher than expected number of dyno-hours. The project CheckTheSock.com is a RC aviation website that provides some weather data. The forecast data is pulled every hour via FTP by a rake task that is run with a scheduled job in Heroku. Normally this takes around a minute to run and uses about 13 or 14 dyno-hours in a month. Less than half way through this month I found that it had already burned through over 200 dyno-hours.After digging into the problem I found that the FTP connection was hanging for some reason. After a little research I came up with a solution that works pretty nicely and for more than just hanging FTP connections.It turns out that ruby's standard library includes a library named Timeout which provides a way to terminate the execution of a thread. Using this library it is very simple to set a time limit for a block of code in a rake test.task :task_that_takes_a_long_time_sometimes do  Timeout.timeout(30) do    #The code that takes a long time to run sometimes  endendThat will raise a Timeout::Error if the code takes longer than 30 seconds to run. The error will cause the rake task to exit, preventing unexpected dyno-hour usage.Posted by Unknown at 8:51 PMLabels: heroku, rake, ruby34 comments:Anna Schafer said...So what do you think of what we are hearing here?
