Lenny Andrews, local greedy uncle, was added to the renowned staff at Alumni Fundraising.According to Andrews, working at Alumni Fundraising has always been a dream of his. “Growing up, I always dreamed of taking money from people. I looked up to the greats like Ponzi and Madoff my whole life,” says Andrews.Rather than pursuing a life of nationwide fraud, though, Andrews chose a life better suited to his family. “We love living in a college town. It’s quiet and beautiful, and Whitman is a perfect outlet for my money-grubbing tendencies,” says Andrews.Since joining Alumni Fundraising on Monday, Andrews has already successfully swindled ten thousand dollars from Whitman alumni, a Whitman College record. His meteoric rise in the Alumni Fundraising department has even caught the eye of President Kathy Murray.“Someone like Lenny is vital to the college’s day-to-day function. I’ve always wanted a swimming pool inside my house, and Lenny is making that dream into a reality for me. If he keeps up the good work, he has a bright future in college administrating,” says Murray.Andrews’ nephew, Carl, knew that Andrews would find his feet quickly in his new role. “Uncle Lenny was born for this job. I was just hoping that this job would make him stop stealing my money, but I guess that was just wishful thinking,” says Carl.President Murray has lauded Andrews, but she understands that he is now a hot commodity. “We know Wall Street is making him offers, but when you find love like we have with Lenny – something so easy and pure – you don’t let it go. You squeeze every last penny out of it,” says Murray.Share this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...RelatedTagged #comedy, #fakenews, #fundraising, #funny, #greed, #greedy, #humor, #money, #satire	Published by flushfactoryView all posts by flushfactory	Post navigationPrevious Post Op Ed: It’s Not Even That ColdNext Post Big Tobacco drowns smokers to decrease lung cancer deathsLeave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
