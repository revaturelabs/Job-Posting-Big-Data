The majority of blue-collar workers, 86 percent, say they are satisfied with their job, with 33 percent saying they are very satisfied. Nearly 85 percent believe their own life is headed in the right direction because of their work.The survey included workers employed full-time, part-time or are self-employed in a job that requires manual labor in the construction, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, automotive services, maintenance, agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting or utilities industry.Financial responses showed a mixed bag of results. Nearly 84 percent of blue-collar workers say they can make ends meet, but nearly half of the workers say it is difficult to make those ends meet, and a tenth say it is very difficult to do so.Fourteen percent of the workers polled say they have currently no money saved in case of emergency, while 24 percent said they had less than $1,000 saved.Despite the financial difficulty, 67 percent are satisfied with the lifestyle they have and 40 percent felt they were better off than their parents were at their age, and 88 percent believe their children will have a better future than they do currently.Nearly 94 percent of those surveyed were able to identify positive things they like about their job, including making a good living wage, being challenged by their work and having flexible hours.What they didn't likeHowever, there were several results from the survey that indicated dislike in the workplace, though these were reported at lower rates than many of the positive traits. Some workers reported dangerous working conditions, limited advancement opportunities, little flexibility in working hours and not making a good living wage.About 58 percent of surveyed workers agreed having a blue-collar job is respected more now than it was 10 years ago, but a similar rate said society looks down on blue-collar workers and 48 percent said at times they feel like a second-class citizen because of the work they do.Despite the challenges, nearly 74 percent say there is a good career path in their line of work. About 65 percent say more men should pursue careers in their field and 52 percent say more women should pursue careers in their field.The political outlook of blue-collar workers revealed a split on several issues, but overall only 30 percent said they trust elected government officials. Only 51 percent believe the federal government is pro-business.President Donald Trump received a 44 percent approval rating in the poll, with 40 percent saying they disapproved. About 36 percent believe Trump has helped their industry, 28 percent believe he's hurt it and 37 percent said the president hadn't helped or hurt their industry. Approximately 39 percent of those polled felt the Republican Party did a better job helping blue-collar Americans while 36 percent felt the workers were better served by the Democratic Party.(Story continued below...)David DishmanBusiness Writer David Dishman has worked as a journalist in Oklahoma since 2014 covering business, education, local government, healthcare and more.
