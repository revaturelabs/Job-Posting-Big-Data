Since 1992 Petrie Recruitment has striven to provide the highest levels of service through a culture of integrity and honesty. Operating from a central Cardiff office, the small but highly experienced team of recruitment professionals aim to provide the right people with the right jobs in the right time scales. Privately owned by Paul and Deborah Harris since 2004 when they successfully completed a management buy out from the founder Lillian Petrie upon her retirement. Since that date the owner-managers have worked hard to instil a culture of “sales through service”. Petrie Recruitment does not follow the industry norm of “sales, sales, sales” rather the belief that if you satisfy your existing customers then growth will come naturally. As a company we can service all industry sectors from highly regulated multi-nationals through to new start-ups. Geographically we believe it is important to know the area being serviced in order to truly understand candidates backgrounds and factors such as commuting times, for this reason we work exclusively in the South Wales area. In summary Petrie Recruitment is the small, but perfectly formed, partner of choice for recruitment within South Wales.View jobs >>Taff HousingTaff was established in 1975 to purchase and refurbish inner city homes that had fallen into poor condition.
