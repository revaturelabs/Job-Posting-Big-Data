In fact, recent and pending legislative mandates are expected to continue to increase Electric service costs into the future, likely by an additional estimated 11-15% over the next 10 years.Low Electric and Water RatesNevertheless, Anaheim residents still enjoy electric rates that are the lowest in Orange County and water rates that are among the lowest of all Orange County water agencies – and that is no coincidence. Our focus is to maximize customer benefits and to minimize any negative impacts that proposed legislation may have on your rates. Our agency is owned by the Anaheim ratepayers and our budget and policies are controlled by the Anaheim City Council. We are not motivated by profit margins or stock dividends to increase your rates.However, more and more legislative and regulatory mandates, as well as their associated costs, remain beyond the control of our local policy body. Instead, they are controlled by state and federal policymakers, and even though many of our local Orange County legislators urge their peers to consider the costs when implementing new legislation, many bills are still passed through the legislature that will ultimately raise the cost of both electric and water services.Legislative ResourcesElected OfficialsCost Impacts of Recently Enacted Electric LawsCost Impacts of Recently Enacted Water Laws2020 State Legislative SummaryLegislative Resource LinksState Legislative InfoCARB’s AB 32CEC’s RPSCity CouncilPublic Utilities BoardPublic Utilities Board Agendas, Minutes & AudioLegislative Impact on UtilitiesUtilities Board Meeting DatesSubcommittee AgendaDepartment OrdersCustomer ServiceWays to SaveBill AssistanceCustomer Alerts & NewslettersWater & Power Outage InfoAnaheim AnytimeAnaheim Public Utilities • 201 South Anaheim Blvd • Anaheim, CA 92805 • Phone: 714-765-3300 • Dial 311 • Emergency: Dial 911Sign In • Home • Site Map • Accessibility • Privacy • Disability & Civil Rights ProgramGovernment Websites by CivicPlus®Arrow Left Arrow Right[]Slideshow Left Arrow Slideshow Right Arrow"
