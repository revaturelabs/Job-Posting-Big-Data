But life is too short to waste on doing things you don’t like.Plus, there are several part-time jobs out there that not only pay sufficiently well, but also let you enjoy yourself while fulfilling your responsibilities at the same time.Wondering where such great opportunities lie?Well, you are about to find out.The following is a list of fun part-time jobs for adults where happiness, work, and money go together hand in hand.1. LifeguardWhile you take a dip in the cool water and soak in the sun lounging on the poolside chair, you might not think of the lifeguard as the guy who gets to have much fun at a swimming pool. But think about it from a worker’s perspective.Being a lifeguard, for the most part, is not a strenuous job. The setting is really nice (your workplace is a pool, duh!), and you usually don’t require any special skills (other than knowing how to swim and CPR). Of course, you will have to stay highly alert and keep a hawk’s eye on the pool, but at the end of the day, you get the chance to be a real-life hero too.According to data collected by PayScale, you can earn an average of $9.27 per hour by working as a lifeguard with no prior experience.2. Dog TrainerWho doesn’t love dogs?If you are a pup parent, you would already know the joys of having a furry friend by your side. Why not increase the fun multifold by surrounding yourself with pooches, and in the meanwhile, stash some extra dollars in your pocket?Dog trainers are expected to have an average income of $20 per hour. However, depending on certain factors such as specialized training courses, you can earn as much as $150 an hour or even more.Who doesn’t love dogs?If you are a pup parent, you would already know the joys of having a furry friend by your side.

TutorTutoring is, by far, one of the most common and highly sought-after part-time jobs for adults. And for all the right reasons too.The work hours are extremely flexible, the pay is good, and you can easily find a student near you, thereby reducing the commuting time and making the side job completely hassle-free.The amount of money you can make will vary according to the number and type of subjects that you teach, the level of education, and of course, the total number of hours dedicated to tutoring.Based on survey results, private part-time tutors in the US have an annual income of $40,297, which equals to approximately $14 per hour – that’s almost double the minimum wage rate in the country!4. School Bus DriverIf you are an early bird, you might enjoy driving a school bus as a fun part-time job for adults. School bus drivers normally have to work less than 20 hours per week, and typically rake in $16 for each hour behind the wheel.It’s a good choice to consider if you love spending time with kids, enjoy driving, or are trying to develop road confidence. Need we say it’s the perfect job for young adults who are not too keen about completing a four-year degree yet still want to earn a decent income?5. Travel AgentIf you love traveling, you will love working as a travel agent, be it a part-time job or not.Channel your wanderlust into making the dream vacation a reality for your customers – the experience will be equally, if not more, rewarding.Based on Glassdoor reviews, part-time travel agents make at least $13 an hour, although many of them have no trouble earning upwards of $20. Most companies pay agents on the basis of commission. So, the better you perform, the more money you can collect within a given time period.If you love traveling, you will love working as a travel agent, be it a part-time job or not.Channel your wanderlust into making the dream vacation a reality for your customers – the experience will be equally, if not more, rewarding.Based on Glassdoor reviews, part-time travel agents make at least $13 an hour, although many of them have no trouble earning upwards of $20.

Private Fitness InstructorAre you a health and fitness enthusiast?If yes, consider becoming a private fitness instructor and make money by helping others achieve their fitness goals. It goes without saying that you will have to get the relevant license before you can start giving private lessons. But rest assured that the time and efforts spent in becoming a certified trainer are well worth it.The hourly rate for part-time fitness instructors varies according to the region, type of training, total sessions, and so on. But based on survey reports, the national average amount to about $25, although making as much as $32 per hour is no big deal.7. Makeup ArtistWith all the makeup tutorials flooding social media feeds these days, we won’t be too surprised if you have learned plenty of tricks of the trade yourself.However, the truth is that despite the follow-along videos and innumerable makeup hacks, many still struggle to flaunt their looks in the right manner. If you feel that you have mastered the art of doing makeup, consider joining a local beauty salon, or perhaps even starting your own services at home.Women flock to makeup artists as proms, wedding ceremonies, anniversary parties, and other similar events come up. So, leverage the high demand and earn some extra dollars through your makeup skills.Do you know how much money part-time makeup artists are reported to earn in South Carolina?According to Indeed, they make $48.67 every hour. That’s almost seven times the minimum wage rate and 75% above the national average income!Amazing, isn’t it?8. Appointment SetterAn appointment setter might not come across as a fun job to many, but it’s a great option for anyone who’s got good communication skills and wants to boost their income without tiring themselves out in the process.As is evident by the name, appointment setters are tasked with contacting potential clients and arranging sales calls. You don’t necessarily have to sell a product or get people to subscribe to your services. In most cases, you will be paid for generating leads as well.The actual amount of money you can generate by setting appointments for a company depends on factors like the type of goods or services being promoted and the commission rate. The normal rate is around $14 per hour. But the best part is that if you deliver exceptional performance, you can expect to make as much as $40 or higher.9. Brand AmbassadorIf you are a real people person with sufficiently good marketing skills, being a brand ambassador might be the ideal job for you. Working as a brand ambassador is a lot like working as an appointment setter, but only more fun.Brand ambassadors are tasked with representing a product or the company at large, in a positive light. They increase brand awareness and in turn, sales revenue for the company by sharing product benefits with prospective customers, giving away free samples and so on.Part-time brand ambassadors in the U.S. typically make between $12 and $20 per hour although some agencies pay over $25 for the same duration.10. Home GardenerGardening can be a really profitable activity for retirees. But you don’t necessarily have to be so old to put your green thumb to work and earn some extra cash in the process.If you are looking for a no-strings-attached side hustle, yield some fruitful results from your backyard (pun intended).Selling home-grown herbs, fruits or vegetables at the local farmers market or on a roadside stand can be a good way to keep yourself busy. All you need is a sufficiently large backyard and to look after your plants well.It might not help you earn too much, but it is a really relaxing activity that you might just fall in love with.Just make sure to check the rules and regulations in your state before you begin.11. CrafterHow can we talk about fun part-time jobs for adults and forget to include crafting on the list?Crafting can be a really addicting hobby. If you love making handmade items, why not put them up for sale and kill two birds with one stone?Customized goods always sell out fast so you can expect to earn a significant amount of money as long as you create something that’s unique and attractive.From jewelry, cards, quilts, and wooden furniture to handmade candles, soaps and whatnot – the sky’s the limit and creativity is your best friend when it comes to earning money through crafting.12. Data Entry SpecialistData entry jobs have become all the rage these days. People are hugely favoring it over other part-time jobs because of the flexibility that it offers.You can work as a data entry specialist both online and on-site. Plus, the work hours can easily be adjusted according to your schedule, and the pay is quite attractive too.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, data entry keyers receive an average hourly wage of about $16. However, experienced works can get up to $22 per hour.Getting this part-time job will be a piece of cake if you can type quickly and accurately, and are well aware of the basic terminology used in the given field.Keep in mind that online data entry scams have become a norm too. So, do thorough research before applying for this job.13. Customer Service RepresentativeFacing the wrath of unsatisfied customers is a part of this job – don’t say we didn’t warn you. But if you have a knack for dealing with angry people and know how to create a win-win situation in scenarios that would have otherwise led to not-so-good results, then this job is definitely worth a try.As a customer service representative, you will have to handle customer complaints and other queries from the current as well as prospective clients. Most of the jobs require you to work over the phone but in some cases, you might have to visit in person too.Indeed reports the hourly wage of these part-time professionals to be around $13. Since customer service jobs are typically part-time by nature, you will be qualified to receive benefits like health insurance, 401 (k) plans and so on. This is one of the biggest perks of this job that sets it apart from others.14. Event PlannerAre you a Type A list-maker with a keen eye for detail? Do you love organizing parties or leading your own team? Or perhaps enjoy bossing everyone around a bit too?If you answered yes to any of these questions, then working as an event planner is a fun part-time job that won’t disappoint.This part-time gig brings in a lot of thrill and excitement. You get to create beautiful events and bring your inner perfectionist to life.The amount of money you can earn majorly depends on the type of event being planned, but based on the listings at Indeed, raking in upwards of $13 is guaranteed.15. Baby SitterWe can’t simply exclude babysitting from the list of fun part-time jobs for adults, can we?It’s the go-to option for those who love kids. It’s an easy-going yet well-paying job that can help you make the most of your free hours without putting in any extra effort.A simple chit chat with your neighbors will probably land you an opportunity to collect a handful of dollars by watching over a kid for a few hours.According to survey results, the babysitter in the U.S makes over $16 an hour.
