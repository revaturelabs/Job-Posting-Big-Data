This curriculum is integrated and highly experiential, and clinical educators with interest in small-group teaching and active learning are encouraged to apply. Faculty in the DVM 2+2 program will be expected to “cross-over” and teach in multiple courses to reinforce content related to their subject matter interest across the 2+2 program.Texas A&M University is the oldest public institution of higher education in Texas and one of the nation’s largest and most dynamic universities.
