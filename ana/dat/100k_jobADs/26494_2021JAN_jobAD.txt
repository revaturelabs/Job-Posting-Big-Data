Some stand-out places I’ve been fortunate to visit over the years are: Mokihinui Forks, Kahurangi Point, Resolution Island, Siberia Valley, Heaphy River Mouth.The awesome-est DOC moment I’ve had so far is:Flying in a helicopter across Fiordland National Park, from Te Anau to Resolution Island.The DOC (or previous DOC) employee that inspires or enthuses me most is:Kim Forbes – he was great at getting things done. You’d often hear him saying to people JFDI (I’ll let you work it out).My wife Carol and I on Buckland Peaks about to start track cutting workOn a personal note…Most people don’t know that:I can speak Welsh fluently. I grew up near Conwy in North Wales. My Father was a Welsh speaker, but my mother wasn’t. Fortunately my Dad decided that I should go to the local Welsh language primary school.It was very useful later in life when I met Carol (my wife) who’s Father didn’t speak much English. It came in handy again whilst working for the Forestry Commission in Dolgellau on the west Wales coast, where 70% of the locals were Welsh Speakers, including my work colleagues.Waiting for The Foo Fighters to come on stage in ChristchurchThe song that always cheers me up is:Seaside Rendezvous – QueenIn my spare time I enjoy:Fly fishing. My interest in fishing started whilst backpacking around New Zealand in 1990. I hired a spinning rod in Queenstown and caught a tiny trout at Bob’s Cove, I was hooked, and I rushed out and bought my first fishing rod.On returning to Wales my brother in law taught me how to fly fish, which has been my passion ever since. I now live in Wanaka and enjoy fishing Lake Wanaka, the Clutha River and a few other rivers that I’m not at liberty to talk about.Landing a rainbow trout at a secret location near WanakaIf I wasn’t working at DOC:If I was financially independent, I’d like to go on a big fishing trip; fishing for salmon in Alaska, bonefish in the Bahamas, and marlin in Costa Rica (we’re all allowed to dream).My hero is:Nelson Mandela. I read his autobiography ‘Long Walk To Freedom’ and was amazed at the way he was able to work with the people that had treated him and his people so badly to bring about positive change in South Africa.Me and Anna (my daughter) at Speargrass HutDeep and meaningful…My favourite quote is:“I told you I was ill” – Spike Milligan’s epitaphThe best piece of advice I’ve ever been given is:Don’t eat the yellow snow (Frank Zappa didn’t personally give me this advice, but I do think its excellent advice).Me and Fred on our way to The Roaring Lion for some huntin’ and fishin’In work and life I am motivated by:Passionate people. If someone is passionate about something, they’re usually interesting to listen to and spend time with.My conservation advice to New Zealanders is:Conservation is everyone’s job; do your bit.Share this:FacebookTwitterPinterestPrintIn Jobs at DOC	career, Inspector, jobs, Staff	One response to Jobs at DOC: Gareth Roberts, Inspectorhttps://naturalbugeliminator.wordpress.com 13/03/2016 at 7:01 pmCurrently it sounds like Drupal is the top blogging platform out thereright now.
