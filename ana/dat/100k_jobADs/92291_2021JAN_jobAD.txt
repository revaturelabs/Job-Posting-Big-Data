In those situations, going to a traditional lender can often be frustrating, especially if you are currently unemployed. You can waste the time of being denied by traditional lenders, or get approved for a car title loan without a job today with Loan Cheetah. Traditional lenders such as banks and loan associations always want the following as a minimum:Collateral: Most traditional lenders require you to submit proof of collateral, such as a car, boat, land deeds, or other proof of value. They do this so that they can be assured they will be paid if you are unable to pay back the loan.Proof of income: Traditional lenders also usually require proof of income before lending you money. This is because they have to have a way of protecting their investment (their loan to you) in the event you cannot pay them at the end of the loan or to make monthly installments. They also require this proof because they want to weigh it against your credit rating to see what your income-to-debt ratio is. This is one of the primary factors involved in deciding whether or not you are someone they want to take a financial risk with.Co-signers (sometimes): In the event that your credit rating is not high enough, the bank may ask you for a co-signer who has better credit. This is so they can get the money owed to them from the second party co-signer, in the event you are unable to pay. This places the co-signer in a state of financial responsibility if you cannot pay back the loan.Creditworthiness: Your credit rating and your debt-to-income ratio is the primary factor that traditional banks use to determine whether or not they can give you a loan. If you are very young and do not yet have a credit rating, or if your credit rating is bad, this will pretty much negate the deal. They must believe you can pay your bills or they will not loan money to you.For those who have had trouble with credit in the past or have not had time to build up a good credit rating, this can cause roadblocks when it comes to getting the money you need. In these difficult times, you may have to look for other options. Also, going through traditional channels can take a great deal of time as well. When you need cash fast, you don't have time to wait. So what can you do in these circumstances when a bank has turned you down?Title Loans: Another Option to get a title loan without a jobDo you own your car and have proof of ownership? One way that you can get money fast is to secure a title loan. If you have never done this before, rest assured it's not a difficult process. Title loans are loans you get for the value of your car. You are not required to get a cosigner, or have your credit rating run through to see if you have good credit. But can you get a title loan without a job?Answer: Yes, You Can Get a Car Title Loan with No IncomeThe good news is, yes, you can get a title loan without a job or even proof of income! That's one of the great things about this option. The only thing they require is your title (proof that you own your car). Your car serves as its own collateral and, unlike the other more traditional institutions, you can get your title loan in a matter of hours in most cases. Think about starting a loan process that only takes a few hours to complete, as opposed to a bank loan that could take days or even weeks to approve.Requirements for Obtaining a Car Title Loan with No JobThere are very few requirements for obtaining a car title loan.
