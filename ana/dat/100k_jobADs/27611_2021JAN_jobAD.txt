I know for me it’s kind of touchy, I’m literally cringing as I write this but it needs to be addressed.I am in my 30’s and in my past I have dealt with unemployed gentlemen (when I was in my 20’s). I have recently dated a guy who is also in his 30’s and jobless. He tries to take me on dates that are inexpensive or he’ll just tell me we can’t go anywhere because “he doesn’t have it”. Needless to say I don’t go on dates with this guy anymore.I’m cringing as I write this because I really don’t and can’t understand a GROWN MAN not having a job. I am digging deep within me trying to find some type of sympathy, but its no where to be found.Once we went on a date to Olive Garden where I was only allowed to eat the salad and he ate the soup. The total for the meal came out to around I think $10.00. The part that really got to me is he didn’t leave a TIP! I said something about it and he still didn’t budge. Okay, so I know you’re thinking “why didn’t you leave a tip”? well guys I didn’t have cash on me, I actually told him that he could have gave me the cash and let me pay with my card so that I can at least leave a TIP.Another date we went on the lady that sat next to us at the bar paid for our drinks. Guys, as soon as she offered and paid he hurried up and and gathered our things so we could leave. I’m thinking he did that so he wouldn’t have to pay for the next round of drinks.My personal feelings about a jobless manMy personal feelings about a “jobless man” are as follows; no matter what, you should be bringing in some type of income, rather you have to scrub floors or flip burgers. “Can I get a AMEN”!No woman should have to carry the responsibilities on her own because her man is an aspiring rapper or singer, or because he can’t handle someone giving him orders.In conclusion, GET A DAMN JOB!THE ENDTagged broke, Dating, dead beat, interracial relationshi, manipulation, marriage, men, money, relationships, taking care of a man, users, womanLeave a comment	Blog at WordPress.com.Add your thoughts here...
