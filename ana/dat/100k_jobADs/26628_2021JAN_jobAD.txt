Here are the highlights…On Getting The Job: “In Hollywood, they always say it’s who you know; it’s not a cliché. I was working on a show for TLC called ‘Gypsy Sisters’ and I was going to sign on for season two, but I started interviewing for other shows. One of my ex-coworkers recommended me to a friend of his, and all I heard was that it was a wrestling show about girl wrestlers. So I made the call to the powers that be and within 30 seconds, she told me it was for the WWE and I said I’ll sign on. I had to break some ties, but everybody knows you have to go where the work is, and I don’t think I could live with myself if I passed up on a WWE show.”On His Job On The Show: “I watch endless amounts of footage,” he said. “I take different aspects and form a story without manipulating it too much. Going in, the executive producers kind of have an idea of what direction they want to go in, but other times a scene will be shot and the story is not getting across, so we have to figure how to do that as quickly as possible. Two people could be having a heart-to-heart, and then all of a sudden a dog could run in barking with some kids and ruin the scene.Trending StoriesKenny Omega Wears Bullet Club Shirt At Hard To KillRyan Clark - January 17, 2021Former WWE & AEW Star Makes His Impact Debut At Hard...Brandon Ewing - January 16, 2021John Cena Makes Appearance During Official WrestleMania Announcement (VIDEO)Brandon Ewing - January 16, 2021Impact Wrestling Hard To Kill News – New Announce Team Debuts,...Ryan Clark - January 17, 2021Backstage Updates On Matt Cardona & Brian Hebner’s Impact Wrestling StatusesRyan Clark - January 17, 2021TAGSTotal DivasWWEStaffRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORNewsRyback Reveals How WWE Negotiates With A Superstar Whose Contract Is ExpiringNewsReport – WWE Interested In Strongest Man Competitors Luke & Tom StoltmanPodcastsSmack Talk Podcast #476 – Royal Rumble 1991 Commentary TrackTrending StoriesKenny Omega Wears Bullet Club Shirt At Hard To KillRyan Clark - January 17, 2021Former WWE & AEW Star Makes His Impact Debut At Hard...Brandon Ewing - January 16, 2021John Cena Makes Appearance During Official WrestleMania Announcement (VIDEO)Brandon Ewing - January 16, 2021Impact Wrestling Hard To Kill News – New Announce Team Debuts,...Ryan Clark - January 17, 2021Backstage Updates On Matt Cardona & Brian Hebner’s Impact Wrestling StatusesRyan Clark - January 17, 2021Vince McMahonVincent Kennedy McMahonBirthdate: 08/24/1945Height: 6'2\"Weight: 248 IbHe is an American professional wrestling promoter and executive, American football executive, and businessman.
