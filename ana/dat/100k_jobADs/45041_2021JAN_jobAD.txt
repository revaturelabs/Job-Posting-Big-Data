The individual must have at least a Bachelor’s degree or specialization and be coming to the United States for a specific occupation. The Trump Administration recently put out a list of all H-1B employers to inform the public. In light of this action, many misconceptions have been made around H-1Bs.One misconception is that H-1Bs are taking over the U.S. workforce and stealing jobs from Americans.The new 9,356 H-1B petitions for the top seven Indian-based companies approved in 2016 represent only 0.006 percent of the U.S. labor force.Another common misconception is that H-1B workers lower American workers’ salaries. In contrast, H-1B employees actually earn the same or slightly more than their U.S. employees in identical fields and age groups.Lastly, many people believe that H-1Bs are especially taking IT positions that could be filled by Americans: But, in April of 2017, it was found that the unemployment rate in the U.S. for “computer and mathematical science” occupations was only 2.5 percent according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Additionally, a Congressional Committee announced that they would like to increase the wages for H-1B’s employees from $60,000 to $90,000. This would be the only way to stop U.S. workers from being hired initially. If the Trump Administration disagrees, this might threaten the innovation that comes with allowing for H-1B visas. Few companies only used 16% of new H-1B visas in 2016.If you or anyone you know has a question about H-1B visas or how to apply, we have extensive experience in these filings.
