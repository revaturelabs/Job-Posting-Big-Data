Carter is giving the armed services until Jan. 1 to submit plans to make the historic change.U.S. Army female soldiers with the 2-17 Field Artillery Regiment, Specialist Lilia Mendieta, 27, from Seattle (L) and Private Atiyhia Goldbold, 20, from New York listen to a briefing as they prepare to leave on a mission in Ramadi, 100 kms west of the capital Baghdad, 26 October 2004. Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi warns of a surge in attacks in the run up to elections promised by January, as the US army announces the killing of a top aide to Iraq's most wanted man in the rebel-held city of Fallujah, 55 kms from Ramadi. (Credit: AFP/Getty Images)The Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Joseph Dunford, former Marine Corps commandant, had argued that the Marines should be allowed to keep women out of certain front-line combat jobs, citing studies showing that mixed-gender units aren't as capable as all-male units. Carter's decision was a rejection of that argument.Carter's order will let women serve in the military's most grueling and difficult jobs, including as special operations forces, such as the Army Delta units and Navy SEALs, according to the defense official.The decision comes after several years of study, and will wipe away generations of limits on how and where women can fight for their country.More from ABC News:In January 2013, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced a timetable for the military services to submit plans for how they would lift restrictions in place since 1994 that banned women from serving in combat units.The services provided plans for reviews and evaluations to determine how that could be done. A target date of January 2016 was established for the Defense Secretary to decide on whether to grant the services exemptions for specific combat jobs that should not be opened to women.Only the Marine Corps sought any exceptions in removing the long-held ban on allowing women to serve in dangerous combat jobs. The Army, Navy and Air Force have moved steadily toward allowing women to serve in all posts, and only the most risky jobs remain closed.The senior defense official said all the services will have to begin putting plans in place by April 1.Carter has hinted at this decision for months, telling U.S. troops in Sicily in October that limiting his search for qualified military candidates to just half the population would be \"crazy.\"He had given Dunford until the end of October to forward his review of the services' recommendations on which jobs, if any, should remain closed to women. As Marine commandant, Dunford was the only service chief to recommend that some front-line combat jobs stay male-only, according to several U.S. officials.Carter had pledged to thoroughly review the recommendations, particularly those of the Marine Corps, but said he generally believes that any qualified candidate should be allowed to compete for jobs. But the senior defense official said that while Carter recognizes there may be difficulties in opening the jobs to women, he has made his decision and all the services will follow it.Answering a question from a Marine in Sicily, Carter said, \"You have to recruit from the American population. Half the American population is female. So I'd be crazy not to be, so to speak, fishing in that pond for qualified service members.\"For that reason, the defense secretary said the military should recruit women into as many specialties as possible.One last thing…Watch TheBlaze live and on demand on any device, anywhere, anytime.try premiumExclusive video'I Want to be a Liberal!'—Chad Prather on how life would be different if he went LeftChad PratherSection 230 reform or antitrust laws — how do we STOP Big Tech censorship?Glenn Radio'You have no idea how bad this was': Dan Bongino details behind-the-scenes 'smear campaigns' against ParlerGlenn RadioAll VideosWatch BlazeTV on your favorite device, anytime, anywhere.Subscribe NowRecommendedNo life insurance?
