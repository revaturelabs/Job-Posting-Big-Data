"Your Job Interview Cover Letter's ImportanceJob Interview Top TipsYour FREE Guide To AcingAny Job InterviewImportance Of Your Cover LetterCreating the perfect cover letter doesn’t have to be difficult.Cover letters are generally short and to the point. You should try to address your cover to someone in particular.You should never address your cover letter with “To Whom It May Concern” or “Dear Sir/Madam”. It’s unprofessional and doesn’t show a genuine interest in the company or the job.The cover letter is the only purpose for looking at the resume. If it’s written badly, the resume might not get a once over.In most cases, the cover letter is just as important as the resume, so I’ve briefly written the right formation of one.The cover letter must begin with a basic greeting and the position that you’re applying for.It shouldn’t be more than 2 lines long.The second paragraph should try to be a brief description of your qualifications and why you applied to work for them.The closing should announce an interest in hearing from them soon, and a thank you for their time.Here’s a sample for a successful cover letter:-----------------------------------------------July 6, 2006In regards to: The clerical position which is available.Mr. Brown3232 Jackson St.Jackson City, FA32443Attention: Mr. Joe BrownDear Mr. Brown,This letter is in regards to the clerical position that has been recently made available in your company.
