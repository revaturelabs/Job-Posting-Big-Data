As an Immigration Agent previously assigned to the Southern California Secure Communities Command Center (SC3), I was provided the opportunity to be a acting supervisor for the largest Secure Communities (SECOM) operation in the United States. When working as an acting supervisor, I was responsible for oversight of approximately 4-5 full time officers, 5 detailers, and 3 contractors. Additionally, I responded to complaints or issues from 3 separate states, 58 different county sheriff departments and 482 local municipalities from the State of California alone. I liaison with these localities regularly in order to develop and improve the continuity of our operations. I addressed a situation involving the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's department in a murder investigation involving several Lawful Permanent Residents and an illegal alien. The detective in charge of the situation contacted me for assistance in establishing communication with the immigration authorities at the point of entry of San Ysidro, California. Once communication was established, I assisted from the command center to develop a sting operation to apprehend the subjects of the detectives investigation. I coordinated between the Customs and Border Protection Officers, Border Patrol Agents, California Highway Patrol, and Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department. As a result of my efforts and the successful operation, the driver was apprehended. Supervising, I evaluated the quality of the shifts work and corrections were provided through individual counsel. Solutions to complaints or areas of needed improvement were done regularly to my immediate supervisor. Through trial and error I implemented ways to increase the overall efficiency of SECOM. Reviewed and revised the Standard Operating Procedures and Continuity of Operations plan for SECOM. Analyzed the SOP/CO-OP for sufficiency and provided recommendations in policy for implementation.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)Albany, New York AreaLaguna Niguel, CALaw EnforcementNoe-HighlighterClick to send permalink to address bar, or right-click to copy permalink.Un-highlight all Un-highlight selectionu Highlight selectionh"
