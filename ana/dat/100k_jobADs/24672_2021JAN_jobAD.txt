Working with me were four nurses who were smokers. I asked permission to sit in a different lounge because I could not support the smoke. But I was accused of being anti-social. So I asked that the door be opened to the lounge. But that didn’t help either, because they were chain smokers. So I asked the supervisor to let me go into a smaller lounge. That resulted in my being reported as anti-social, the supervisor stating it was unacceptable for me to be alone. But I could not take it.Then the manager ordered the staff to stop smoking in the facility, and implemented a “non smoking” policy. As a result, the staff became very angry with me. Now they had to go outside if they wanted to smoke. So they say it was her fault that they had to go outside.They began making my life harder. For example, they asked a resident who was heavy to ask me to lift her, but I could not, which resulted in the supervisor being called in. Once again the manager heard the explanation, and but surprisingly ordered the staff to stop lifting this woman.Then one night, only two of the nurses came in to work—one of them had quit and was never been seen again. Then the second one quit. A month or two later, the senior nurse who had caused problems, also quit. So the home became free of those unkind people.—SarahNotable Bible PromisePsalms 18:1-3 (NKJV) 1 \"I will love You, O Lord, my strength. 2 The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer; My God, my strength, in whom I will trust; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. 3 I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised; So shall I be saved from my enemies.\"Psalms 6:8-10 (NKJV) 8 \"Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; For the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. 9 The Lord has heard my supplication; The Lord will receive my prayer. 10 Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; Let them turn back and be ashamed suddenly.\"Notable Quotation\"The divine instruction to us is, “Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass.” “Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him.” This is my attitude now. Here is my faith, to stand here <still,> and see the salvation of God. I do not want to wrestle my way out of the hands of Christ. “In quietness and confidence shall be your strength.” I am indeed in great perplexity; I must not dishonor Jesus, I must watch, must pray, must believe. The time of uncertainty and trial is no time for me to be in a hurry and want to deliver myself. I must not move rashly and mar my faith and weaken my own soul.\" {Lt82-1895.20}Related InformationTestimonies of Answered PrayerFinding a Long Lost GrandfatherFinding a Place to LiveGod Brought Many For Gas and Other BillsGod Marvelously Blessed A Wheat HarvestGod's Saving GraceOvercoming a $19,000 DebtDisciple Heart | PO Box 244 | Berrien Springs, MI 49103	Powered by SimpleUpdates.com © 2002-2021.
