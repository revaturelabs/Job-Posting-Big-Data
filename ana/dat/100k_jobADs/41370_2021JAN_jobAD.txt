In fact most of the time I just say housewife! As Freddie is now 8 I do get a few funny looks and the amount of time people say do you not get bored. Well the reality is, I work full time, in fact probably on average well over a 10 hour day blogging.If you are working as a blogger check out my posts on how to increase your pinterest and twitter traffic.Blogging is a fairly new industry in the UK but there are hundreds of us who play down what we do. So many people have no idea what blogging is, or how we actually make money.blognoun1. a website containing a writer‚Äôs or group of writers‚Äô own experiences,observations, opinions, etc., and often having images and links together websites.2. a single entry or post on such a website: She regularly contributes a blog to the magazine‚Äôs website.verb (used without object), blogged, blogging.3. to maintain or add new entries to a blog.verb (used with object), blogged, blogging.4. to express or write about on a blog: She‚Äôs been blogging her illness for almost a year.First recorded in 1995-2000; shortening of weblogRelated forms: blogger, nounAccording to Fleamail there are 15k registered UK blogs registered over their 4 sites. Their sites include Tots 100, which is for parenting blogs. HIBS100 for UK lifestyle blogs. TRIPS100 for UK travel bloggers and FOODIES100 for food bloggers.Social Media Job TitlesI have done some research within the blogging community and these are the social media job titles we give ourselves:So why are there so many job titles for effectively the same job?Of course we do all work slightly differently, but in essence it is the same. I am surprised at how many people actually tell people they are a blogger, as my experience of this has been negative.Is it because my peers are all over 40? Or is it something else?A number of people think that blogging is just a hobby, now I know for some this is the case. But for us full time bloggers this is how we make our living.My previous employment was a Finance Director for a large engineering company, and as such people expect me to be doing a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù job. Going forward rather than say I am a housewife I will tell people I work for myself in marketing! I know this is a cop out but it avoids unwelcome looks and questions.Lynn from Mrs Mummypenny has a different experience though. She was also in a high profile ‚Äúnormal‚Äù job before setting up her very successful blog. Lynn has been blogging for 5 years, 3 years full time, and is incredibly proud of being a blogger. She enjoys telling people all about her work and finds that people are genuinely interested.What do other bloggers think?Victoria from Lylia Rose ‚ÄúI never say the same thing! I say full time blogger, professional blogger or freelance blogger. Then I get the dreaded question ‚Äòhow do you make money blogging‚Äô and I waffle on with them nodding probably not understanding anything I‚Äôm saying‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúMaybe I should say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a full time freelance professional blogger‚Äô!! I never know how to simply tell someone I make money, there are so many ways, but mostly sponsored posts and it‚Äôs hard to explain that to someone who is clueless about websites and even technology (that‚Äôs if it‚Äôs older family members trying to understand and question me!)‚Äù ‚ÄúOoh I guess saying I make money by helping companies with their digital marketing might be a good response üôÇ ‚ÄúI swear half my family think I just magically make money and sit at home doing nothing all day‚Ä¶Are you a full time blogger?
