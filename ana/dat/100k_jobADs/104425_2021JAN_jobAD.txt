He speaks of his skin healing, and then breaking out afresh; and he describes what could very well be some type parasitic influence as well (verse 5). He transitions from speaking to his friends, to speaking of God in the third person, to speaking directly to God.He considers the extent of his suffering to be so great that he asks God if He regards him as large of a threat as a sea monster or the seal itself, so that he needs to be afflicted in this manner to “set a guard” over him. He has come to believe, clearly, that it is God’s will for him to suffer, and wonders aloud why He won’t forgive whatever transgression Job might be guilty of doing. Job’s suffering has brought him to the point of losing hope and he again wishes for death to overtake him.Read or listen to audio of ESV version of this selection from this link./Bob’s boy___________________some images © V.
