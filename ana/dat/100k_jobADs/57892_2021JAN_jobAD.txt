His October-released mixtape cemented his status as \"One to Watch\" for 2021.Speaking to Hot Press recently about his jazz-infused mixtape FOREVER CLASSIC, Gough said:Advertisement\"Every word, sentence, and sound you hear, I wanted it to take you into a world that I created, mainly because I couldn’t get out and be in the world, with lockdown. I tried to create this world based on my love for the ‘80s and ‘90s. I’ve described it to a few people now as being like a movie. The end is supposed to be this tongue-in-cheek interview, summing up the project like credits in a film. I want people to be able to immerse themselves in it, and create a world that might not be immediately obvious, but if you really look at it and dig, you’ll find it.\"Catch the young artist performing at Eurosonic Noorderslag 2021 tonight.
