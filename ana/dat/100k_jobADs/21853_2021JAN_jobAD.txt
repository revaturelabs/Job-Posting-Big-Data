As many as 100 positions may be impacted in Dubai although the number hasn't been finalised, two of the people said.The eliminations also include leadership at the firm's priority banking operations, which offer personalised wealth-management services, one of the people said.The staff reduction is coming as Standard Chartered chief executive officer Bill Winters is looking for ways to reignite growth. The bank is weighing a plan to simplify its structure, reduce funding expenses and free up liquidity, people familiar with the matter said earlier last week.A representative for Standard Chartered said the company has made \"substantial progress in executing the transformation plan laid out in 2015\" and will disclose its strategy for improving returns at its full-year results in February.The lender is expected to unveil a strategic review to address investor concerns about rising expenses and an approximate 40 per cent decline in the share price since Mr Winters became chief executive officer in June 2015. He said in October that the London-based lender was working on a three-year plan to improve performance. The bank had about 86,000 employees at the end of June.You may also likeCSansomPhotoLauf/Biehler Scotland photo shoot #1CSansomPhoto2 weeks agoeverybooksHigher Education Archives - Everybookeverybooks2 weeks agosdz7038Best Damascus Chef's Knives | High Carbon German Stainless Steel Utility Knivessdz70383 days agolisakristineCreative Ideas for Interior Decoration of the House or ApartmentlisakristineyesterdayAnabel9Cardiovascular Diseases and DisordersAnabel92 weeks agoSwayam IndiaTable Runners - Way to Joyful Meal Sessionswayamindiaa week agoezyfitrollerRoller Shutters Melbourneezyfitroller4 days agoAction And Toy FiguresRemote Control Car Toy Under $200shopforgamers2 days agoinstadiet22Reduce Your Weight by Staying At Homeinstadiet22a week agoadityaranaAmmunition Market to Boost Beyond $27.64 Billion by 2027adityarana5 days agoDiscussionNo comments yet...
