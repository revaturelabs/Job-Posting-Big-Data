A novel technology being developed at Purdue University could help prevent these incidents.A research group led by Ernesto Marinero, a professor of materials engineering and electrical and computer engineering has developed novel materials and fabrication that could allow a bullet to become non-lethal and disintegrate after a designated distance. The technology was built out of a need for a safer bullet that will significantly reduce collateral damage and injury in law enforcement, military and civilian sectors.Conventional bullets retain a significant portion of their energy after traveling hundreds or even thousands of meters. The Purdue-developed innovation enables the bullet to disintegrate over a predetermined period due to the heat generated during firing in conjunction with air drag and an internal heating element. The heat conducts through the entire bullet part, melts the low temperature binder material, and encounters drag forces, which causes disintegration.This technology combines the stopping power of standard bullets, the shrapnel-eliminating benefits of frangible bullets, and a limitation of range to decrease potential bystander injury or death.The Purdue Research Foundation’s Office of Technology Commercialization has patented the technology, and it is available for license.Explore further:Stray-bullet shootings most often harm innocentsSource linkShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)RelatedShareSearch for:CategoriesAerospace EngineeringAgricultural EngineeringBiomedical EngineeringChemical EngineeringCivil EngineeringComputer EngineeringConstruction EngineeringElectrical EngineeringElectronics EngineeringEnvironmental EngineeringGeotechnical EngineeringMaterial EngineeringMechanical EngineeringPetroleum and GasPetroleum EngineeringTelecommunications EngineeringRecent NewsGroup says enhancements to the observing system are urgently needed with the accelerating pace of climatic and oceanic change — ScienceDaily January 15, 2021UC Berkeley conservationist discovers the first evidence of visual communication among tropical glass frogs — ScienceDaily January 15, 2021Conductive nature in crystal structures revealed at magnification of 10 million times — ScienceDaily January 15, 2021You have a question?And Need Our Help?Contact UsAbout UsWe provide expert industrial solutions to businesses.
