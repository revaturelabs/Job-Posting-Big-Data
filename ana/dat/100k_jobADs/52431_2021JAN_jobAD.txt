Some days I am heads-down coding 80% of the time; others are filled with multiple client presentations, internal discussions, or even writing a blog post. Being able to utilize my data science knowledge and make an impact on clients' business is an incredibly rewarding experience for me.VeraData ScientistWhat are Bounteous Perks + BenefitsBounteous Benefits OverviewYes, we offer competitive paychecks and annual bonuses, but we also offer top-of-the-line healthcare, vision, dental, disability, and life insurance; flexible spending accounts, including transportation savings; 401(k) benefits; and a take-what-you-need vacation policy. At Bounteous, rewarding our people for a job well done is the most important job we do.You could say our perks start with free craft brew (including Bounteous' own) at Beer O’clock or with the Friday lunches and snacks all day, every day. Offering flexible working hours and choosing from two comfortable offices in public transportation and restaurant-friendly locations are definite pluses. For some, it’s the shiny new Apple computers and displays. For others, it’s our annual Hackathon, lunch and learn sessions, a tech conference, or certification opportunity. Or maybe it’s simply the camaraderie during an annual 5K, a bunch of coworkers kicking back and playing games during happy hour, a competitive dodgeball tournament, or bringing a date to our annual holiday bash.
