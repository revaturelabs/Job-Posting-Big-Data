Welch said that would need to be done eventually, but there are some other changes to the job description that are in the discussion phase. The plan is for all of the proposed changes to the city clerk position to be presented to the Council and voted on at a later date.Welch said there are also plans to move the city clerk’s office from the front office to somewhere with less distractions while the clerk works on finances.The City Council also approved hiring an attorney to serve as the court-appointed attorney for those who cannot afford it. This attorney will make $750 per month.“This is a good plan,” Reed said. “We don’t have a choice in this. By law, we have to appoint an attorney for any person that cannot afford an attorney and it is paid from the court.”The move is expected to save the city money based on the current system which has cost up to $2,000 per month.Welch said there have been up to four different attorneys appointed by the court at one time to serve as attorneys for those who cannot afford one in one court session.An attorney, who has worked with the court for several years, has expressed interest in the position, according to Reed.Share this:TwitterFacebookYou Might LikeBack Pack Buddies fight local child hungerBy JOYANNA LOVE/ Senior Staff Writer Union Grove Baptist Church is in its third year of helping fight child hunger... read morePrint ArticleLatest Local NewsClanton Council to consider organizational structure changesTPD animal control officer retiresCOVID-19 vaccine available for 75 and olderY to offer before-school careThorsby to update town’s mower lineupLatest OpinionClanton’s skating rink turns 60OPINION: Thanks for a memorable five yearsOPINION: Here’s to a year of learning and growthLocal cowboy ropes ‘Top in the Nation’OPINION: Rivals take center stage at county basketball tourneyLatest SportsMixed results in CCHS v.
