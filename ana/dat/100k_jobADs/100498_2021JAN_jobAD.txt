By day and trade he’s a graphic designer, but he always had ambitions of being an artist. But no one ever told him that he could. So he pursued the next best thing, design. And he’s good at it.For as long as I’ve known him, John has been a designer and an illustrator. But it wasn’t until he sat down, moved by the news of losing our generation’s Gutenberg, Edison, Picasso, Carnegie, that he drew this tribute to Steve Jobs and something inside of him opened up.Over the past two months, John has been drawing almost every night and this month, he’s decided to sell a limited number of Steve Jobs’ Tribute Prints to benefit Movember. While pancreatic cancer took one of the most inspiring innovators of our time, John wanted to do something and help raise money to make sure that other men are not taken before their time like Steve Jobs was.Why you should care about MovemberMovember is the month formerly known as November and is dedicated to growing moustaches and raising awareness and funds for men’s health issues; specifically cancers affecting men. To show my support for the men in my life, I have signed up as a Mo Sista. Why do I care about men’s health?Because:1 in 6 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetimeA man is diagnosed with prostate cancer every 2.2 minutes1 in 2 men will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime24% of men are less likely to go the doctor compared to womenThose statistics suck.John’s three-weeks into growing his ‘stache, but tragically, even though I’m a Mo Sista, I can’t grow a mustache. It’s physically impossible. So instead, I’m asking you to support our Movember campaign in two ways:Support our Movember campaign through a donation – If you would like to and can, please make a tax-deductible donation of $5, $10, or $25 to our Movember campaign.Or if you’re a charitable geek at heart –Purchase a limited edition of John’s Steve Jobs Tribute print – You can purchase the print through his etsy store or by contacting me directly. All proceeds of the prints go directly to the Movember campaign and will be mailed out at the end of the month. You can purchase a 12” x 12” print on Luster paper or a 16” by 16” on Canvas. All prints are individually signed and numbered.In case you’re wondering, the print looks amazing in person.Time to get your Mo onWe only have one more week to grow and support these Movember moustaches, so please come along for the ride. And John will not be selling this print once Movember ends.Funds raised during Movember will help make a tangible difference to the lives of others. Through the Movember Foundation and their men’s health partners, the Prostate Cancer Foundation and LIVESTRONG, Movember is funding world-class awareness, research, educational and support programs, which would otherwise not be possible.
