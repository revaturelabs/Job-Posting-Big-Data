Mahaney	Year: 2016	Session: Main Session	Normally, when we consider the Reformers, we consider the theological revolution they brought about; this consideration is good and right. One aspect of the Reformers we often skip over, however, is that these men were fundamentally pastors. As such, the Reformers lent great pastoral contributions that we can receive much encouragement from especially in the midst of our suffering. CJ Mahaney looks to the Reformation and to the book of Job for such encouragement.Subscribe for updates and more resources from T4GSpeaker	C.J. MahaneyC.J.
