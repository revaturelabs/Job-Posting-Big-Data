The dj responded on twitter to a question as to why they‚Äôre doing this contest with ‚Äúpeople choose these procedures for different reasons. theyre expensive, our contest is helping someone who has made that choice.‚ÄùWhile I completely agree that everyone has the freedom to choice and their own reasons for getting implants, I don‚Äôt agree that a radio station should be giving $10,000 for someone to be getting it.The contest will go on, so I do hope that it goes to a woman who had breast cancer or some other illness and actually needs it.What are everyone else‚Äôs views on this?Helpful (0)Reply	Post # 3Member6391 postsBee Keeperjo.lee10 years agoWedding: September 2011I mean, it‚Äôs their money, they can do what they want with it. I‚Äôm a very busty girl, and idk why anyone would want them. Clothes don‚Äôt fit, you have back pain and creepy old men stare at your chest. üòõHelpful (0)Reply	Post # 4Member3620 postsSugar bee.twist.10 years agoWedding: October 2011@Ryansgirl: lol. CJ92?Sounds like something they‚Äôd do!I dunno, I guess I kind of agree with the radio persons answer. I‚Äôm sure there will be girls who don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù it joining the contest, but I‚Äôm sure their will be people who do need it and can‚Äôt afford it, and that‚Äôd be nice if it went to them.I‚Äôm not for unnecessary cosmetic work. But I do think that if you are doing it for you, honestly for you, then there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it, especially if it will help with your self esteem and confidence.Helpful (0)Reply	Post # 5Member1331 postsBumble beeAudzinLuv10 years agoWedding: December 2016Hmmmmmm, if they were offering a free tummy tuck then I know I‚Äôd be calling in trying to win that contest!!!!!! But you‚Äôre right, how much nicer would it be for a woman to get reconstructive surgery if she lost one or both breasts from cancer‚Ä¶Helpful (0)Reply	Post # 6Member4160 postsHoney beeRyansgirl10 years agoWedding: October 2011View original reply@.twist.: haha, totally sounds like something they would do, but no!!!

I thought I heard something about this a whiile ago about another station doing it and there were all sorts of rules they had to follow that it became too complicated and they cancelled it. Something to do with the Competition Act not allowing that kind of contest..Wouldn‚Äôt it be covered by provincial health care if it were illness related (breast cancer)? Here it is as far as I know.Helpful (0)Reply	Post # 8Member1312 postsBumble beeTheMrs201310 years agoWedding: June 2013View original reply@AudzinLuv: Ditto to the tummy tuck! Although, I can think of far more important things to spend $10000 on than cosmetic surgery (my son‚Äôs future being at the top of that list).Helpful (0)Reply	Post # 9Member4160 postsHoney beeRyansgirl10 years agoWedding: October 2011View original reply@Ms. Martian: I have no idea if it would be covered here, but I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll cancel this one too. There are a gazillion more things that $10,000 can be better put towards.Helpful (0)Reply	Post # 10Member633 postsBusy beewest.coast.blonde10 years agoWedding: April 2011View original reply@Ryansgirl: No kidding‚Ä¶they should give this money to the children‚Äôs hospital or a more worthy cause. Even better, they should have tied it into breast cancer awareness and maybe given it to someone who‚Äôs done a ton of work to raise money or campagne‚Ä¶that would make more sense‚Ä¶Helpful (0)Reply	Post # 11Member3363 postsSugar beeCupCakeMeg10 years agoWedding: December 2011Hopefully they pick someone deserving and not just someone insecure with their itty bittys.Helpful (0)Reply	Post # 12Member4800 postsHoney beeWonderstruck10 years agoWedding: September 2011It‚Äôs Amp Radio‚Ä¶there is no way they‚Äôll cancel the contest. Their listeners are way more likely to get excited over plastic surgery than a college scholarship or anything else that could be put towards. They know what their target demographic is, and they‚Äôre going after it.Helpful (0)Reply	Post # 13Member362 postsHelper beeTostones10 years agoWedding: August 2014I would love to have that money towards some student loans! LMAOHelpful (0)Reply	Post # 14Member3798 postsHoney beesoyjoy22210 years agoWedding: June 2012A radio station where I live is doing that as well. I wonder if it is the same station although it says the OP is in Canada. I personally don‚Äôt agree with it and I am actually a little scared that a radio station is having a contest for a surgery. Hopefully whoever gets it ‚Äòneeds‚Äô it, for whatever reason. I wonder if there is an age limit? That would be crazy if at 16 year old won or something.Helpful (0)Reply	Post # 15Member2187 postsBuzzing beeHLK641110 years agoWedding: June 2011I think it sounds a little awesome! Coming from insecure itty bitties over here who can‚Äôt afford a boob job!Helpful (0)Reply	The topic ‚ÄòRadio station hosting a contest to win a boob job‚Ä¶?‚Äô is closed to new replies.Get the best wedding inspiration, advice, and more from Weddingbee.comSubscribe to NewsletterI agree to receive emails from the site.I can withdraw my consent at any time by unsubscribing.\"Yes!
