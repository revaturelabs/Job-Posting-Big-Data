Richmond's financial results included $10.8 million in JobKeeper payments across the football club and its range of businesses, but the club made only a $217,727 profit.Kayo is your ticket to the best sport streaming Live & On-Demand.

But it was on the back of a $20 million revenue reduction and working with a skeleton staff.\"It was a premiership won on the road and came at a heavy cost for all AFL clubs.Gordon said of the JobKeeper program: \"Holistically I am a man from the left side of politics but I have to admire the Scott Morrison government for JobKeeper. It was very important to AFL clubs just as it was to businesses right across Australia,\" he said.\"My guess was the Dogs would record far and away the biggest loss in our history, in excess of $8 million and possibly $10 million.\"He told SEN the club had to stand down 70 people but eventually improved the club's financial picture enough to make a profit.jon.ralph@news.com.auOriginally published as $10m JobKeeper lifeline barely keeps Tigers afloatMore StoriesAussie monster’s vicious beatingPremium Content ‘New and exciting’ challenge set for Nathan Herne in 2021Premium Content Australian rugby’s latest blow on world stageBullets secure NBA player as final importMore StoriesAussie monster’s vicious beatingPremium Content ‘New and exciting’ challenge set for Nathan Herne in 2021Premium Content Australian rugby’s latest blow on world stageBullets secure NBA player as final import0aflRead MoreLogin to followaussie rulesRead MoreLogin to followjobkeeperRead MoreLogin to followsportRead MoreLogin to followafl aussie rules jobkeeper sportSubscriber ExclusivesPremium Content Lismore’s ‘unplanned’ Invasion Day protest set to go aheadNews While some will celebrate attaining citizenship, others will be gathering in solidarity with First Nations people.Premium Content VOTE NOW: Crown the Best Cafe in LismoreFood & Entertainment Help Matt Preston's search for the best cafe in Lismore and support your local, passionate team by casting your vote.
