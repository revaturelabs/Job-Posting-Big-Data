All original as far as I can tell other than the couple things I have done to it to get it running. This is as close as you can get to a survivor car. It had been sitting for a long time, probably at least 15 years, but is in excellent condition. It was owned by that proverbial Little old lady and was always kept garaged. Her husband had driven it very little over the years. It had been kept in a temperature controlled garage for at least the last several years. The paint on it is shiny and looks fantastic with just a light washing. I haven't even waxed it yet. As far as I can tell, it even has the original spare tire with it. Also, though they aren't pictured in the photos, I do have all 4 original center caps for the rims. I haven't put them back on yet. It has the smallblock 350/300 HP, and is an automatic. It does have power steering.When I got it, the brakes were all locked up from sitting. I have put new steel sleeved O-ring calipers on it, along with drilled rotors and new pads. I kept all the original calipers, pads and rotors which will go with the car. The other major thing I have done to it is installed a new gas tank. The original one was pretty crudded up, though it didn't leak as far as I know. I still have it, along with the build tag which was on the top of the tank. If you wanted to bring the car back to completely original, I believe the tank is repairable.Other than that, I have changed some of the fluids, the thermostat, plugs, wires, and distributor cap. The car is very driveable. Probably needs some suspension upgrades, but drives nice. Definitely a head turner. The convertible top is in pretty decent condition for being original, does have one seam near the back that has come loose. I haven't taken it yet to an upholstry shop to see if it's repairable. The body seems to me to be in exceptional condition overall for the age of the car. Even the chrome isn't rusted or pitted. Underneath the car seems to be in extremely good condition as well. On the passenger side door, there is a small dent/scrape in the fiberglass from where it looks like the door was opened up and bumped something. I already have an appointment scheduled to have that professionally repaired by a body shop that specializes in old cars. They are also going to professionally wax and buff it all out. It will literally look like it just drove off the showroom floor in a couple weeks.
