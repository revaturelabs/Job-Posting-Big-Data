Under Death Metal, Progressive MetalJob For a Cowboy are returning with a vengeance. Their upcoming album, \"Sun Eater\", will burn the Earth come November 11th. In support of this, the band has dropped a brand new track, \"The Celestial Antidote\" via Metal Injection. Besides being generally awesome, the track also features contributions from ex-lead guitarist Bobby Thompson.LISTEN HEREGuitarist Al Glassman had the following to say:“Bobby Thompson, who left us as a full time member in 2010, continues to remain a part of Job for a Cowboy always, and once again contributed an incredible track to the new record. For those who have heard “Tarnished Gluttony” (his contribution to the last record), you will not be disappointed with his latest song. It’s moody and heavy as hell, and features some of my favorite guitar work on the record on Tony’s end. After years of writing with Bobby, I can honestly say that this is his best work yet with JFAC and I hope you guys dig it too!”Links: Facebook // Official Website // Merch // iTunesSee More: Death Metal, Job For A Cowboy, Progressive Metal« ENTITIES NEW SONG “ESUNA” / NEW ALBUM ANNOUNCED!UNEARTH “WATCHERS OF RULE” ALBUM REVIEW »FEATURED SONGTOP 10Polyphia Fires Their DrummerCannibal Corpse –…The Djenerator!
