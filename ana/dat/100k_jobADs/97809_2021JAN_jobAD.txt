Taylor also offers advice for designers or electrical engineers in the job market, including tips on writing that perfect résumé and the return of the counter-offer.Andy Shaughnessy: Tell us a little bit about the company and why you’re here.Taylor Rousse: I’m an engineering recruiter, and I specialize in hardware, software, electrical, and test. Aerotek is the largest privately-held staffing company in the U.S. and in the world. There are a lot of different divisions, including customer service on the non-technical side; on the technical side, we also have engineering, clinical, and sciences. I specialize in the engineering division, so I only recruit people with engineering skill sets.Shaughnessy: What are some of the trends you see in the industry right now?Rousse: From an aerospace and defense standpoint, that is where I see the most business and recruits coming out of nationally. There aren’t enough people to fill the jobs that they have within the aerospace and defense space. People who have security clearance are in extremely high demand, and not even from a compensation standpoint, but from a benefits standpoint too; they can demand what they want in a role. From an embedded system perspective, a lot of students coming out of school with a computer science degree are interested in the cloud and application software, and there is more demand than ever for embedded, C, and C++. FPGAs are absolutely off the chart.I’m looking for an entry-level FPGA designer right now, and the company is very flexible with what they’d offer for the right person. Embedded, C, and C++ are a necessary skill set that’s going to be around, especially when it comes to people who are coming out of school, because the company gets a chance to bring them up with training in the ways they would like them to work. With FPGA design, you can get into the aerospace and defense space 100% and go for it. If a company gives you the chance to come on without a clearance, take that job.To read this entire interview, which appeared in the December 2019 issue of Design007 Magazine, click here.SharePrintSuggested ItemsStephen Chavez and Happy Holden on Designing Reliable Vias12/02/2020 | I-Connect007 Editorial TeamAndy Shaughnessy and Happy Holden speak with Stephen Chavez, a staff engineer with an aerospace company and chairman of the Printed Circuit Engineering Association (PCEA), about designing vias for greater reliability. They also address several areas where they can look to improve reliability, a variety of steps that designers should take to help ensure more robust vias, and some testing and educational resources that PCB designers and design engineers should be aware of.I-Connect007 Editor’s Choice: Five Must-Reads for the Week08/28/2020 | Andy Shaughnessy, Design007 MagazineThis week, we have quite a potpourri for you. There's good news about the PCB market. And as this year continues to surprise us at every turn, companies are discovering the true nature of their leaders. Todd Kolmodin has a great column about bosses and leaders and why the two words are not synonymous. Not to be outdone, columnist Barry Olney found a way to explain the wavelength of electromagnetic energy by using a chocolate bar and a microwave oven. We also have great articles by Sagi Reuven and Pete Starkey.Book Excerpt: Producing the Perfect Data Package06/03/2020 | I-Connect007 Editorial TeamThe following is an excerpt from Chapter 1 of Mark Thompson's I-Connect007 eBook \"The Printed Circuit Designer’s Guide to...
