Most of the desireable jobs I've seen require a job success score of 90% or above. To have a high success score, I need to land jobs and do well. I can't land a job without a success score. How can I build my job success score if I can't land any jobs? Please help. Thanks!Solved!

Simply search for what you're curious about and Voila!Whenever there are projects you are qualified to do, Chris, and would like to do apply. Many Clients aren't even aware that 90% or above is selected. It's a default setting in many cases.We were all new once without any projects under our belts or any JSS.

Be sure when applying that you highlight your experience and expertise, on or off Upwork, and that your profile and portfolio reflect the same.1 KudoReplyActive MemberKristin P Member Since: Feb 13, 2018Mark as NewBookmarkSubscribeSubscribe to RSS FeedPermalinkPrintEmail to a FriendReport Inappropriate Content5 of 11May 11, 2018 01:52:46 PM by Kristin PWhy is 90% the default? Why not lower? I apply and apply for those that I don't qualify for on my %. And I may not be \"right\" for the but all proposals come back saying that I don't qualify.

Is there someone that can help with some advisements?I don't represent Upwork so this is just my opinion but it's probably set at 90% because that's the cut-off for a Top Rated badge. And even if the default were set to the next lower level, at 80%, you still wouldn't \"qualify\", but that really doesn't matter because the 90% Job Success is a 'preferred qualification\", not a required qualification, so clients do receive your proposals. If you actually received a notification from Upwork saying your proposal doesn't qualify, then you should take a screenshot of it and post it here so support can look at it, because proposals are not supposed to be rejected automatically due to lack of a particular Job Success Score.__________________________________________________\"No good deed goes unpunished.\" -- Clare Boothe Luce1 KudoReplyCommunity GuruPandora H Member Since: May 11, 2010Mark as NewBookmarkSubscribeSubscribe to RSS FeedPermalinkPrintEmail to a FriendReport Inappropriate Content7 of 11May 12, 2018 11:35:17 AM by Pandora H@John K wrote:that really doesn't matter because the 90% Job Success is a 'preferred qualification\", not a required qualification, so clients do receive your proposals.

And EVERY time I see this exact question I cringe, because NOWHERE is this question properly answered except in the many, many forum posts that new members start about the same **bleep** topic.To the OP: It's a real shame you had to post to get this answer.

I think the proposal is key to getting jobs. The client wants to know that you read their post, tell them how you're going to implement the project from a higher level, and just showing a general interest in their project. Don't send the same generic proposal to every client. Tailor each one to their needs and actually read their post. That in combination with the lower rate eventually landed me my 1st job on here. It may take some time to win a job but it is possible. It would help to write a good profile with some portfolio examples if you have any. Then once you get your 1st job and a good rating, you can charge a little bit more next time.1 KudoReplyCommunity GuruJohn K Member Since: Feb 17, 2015Mark as NewBookmarkSubscribeSubscribe to RSS FeedPermalinkPrintEmail to a FriendReport Inappropriate Content10 of 11May 12, 2018 01:41:02 PM Edited May 12, 2018 02:21:41 PM by John KAndrew, well said; that's how I got started at oDesk many years ago. And while it's true you don't want to be pigeonholed as an entry level freelancer, that will only happen if you take an hourly job for a low rate, so start with small fixed price jobs. Not many legit clients will hire a brand new freelancer on an hourly basis anyway. (A careful client will be aware that quality of work cannot be disputed if time tracker is used, so will hesitate to offer hourly work to an unproven freelancer.)__________________________________________________\"No good deed goes unpunished.\" -- Clare Boothe Luce1 KudoReply« Previous12Next »Helpful TipsUpwork Profiles: Why a Great Title and...Your profile is an opportunity to convey your confidence and competence to potential clients — and for many of them, that critical first impression will start with two highly visible sections: Your profile title and overview.Learn MoreHelpful TipsTips from Upwork's Talent Success TeamUpwork's Talent Success Team offers suggestions for crucial steps to complete as a new freelancer on Upwork.Learn MoreHelpful TipsCrafting an Impressive Agency Profile on UpworkWhether you're setting up an agency profile for the first time or keeping an existing profile up-to-date, follow these best practices to make sure your agency's presence is the best it can be.Learn MoreHelpful TipsHow to Create a Proposal That Wins JobsEighteen months after quitting her 9-to-5 job, Andreea-Lucia Mihalache is a Top Rated copywriter on Upwork.
