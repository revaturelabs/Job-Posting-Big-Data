My mission is to empower people to shed old habits that no longer serve them in order to grow into a happier, healthier and more authentic lifestyle curated to fit their goals and desires. I received my credentials from the Institute for Integrative Nutrition, the leading Health Coach Certification program in the United States. I’m a Certified Integrative Health & Life Coach who also is a coffee-loving, animal-crazy lady trying to figure out this whole adulting thing while actually being happy in the process. I also am a Certified Counseling Practitioner. In the last five years I've evolved my passion for teaching to include helping and mentoring others on how to live a life of fulfillment through wellness, not through deprivation. Taking control of your health is a huge step to freedom and fulfillment. I can't wait to work with you on your journey!CertificationsIntegrative Nutrition Health CoachCounseling PractitionerEducationInstitute for Integrative Nutrition - CertifiedUniversity of Colorado at Colorado Springs - Bachelors of ArtsGeneral infoBook an appointment$75.00 per appointmentCategory : NutritionSubcategory : CounselingPhotosVideosGet help shedding the last few poundsAppointment Length0 hour 45 minutesService DescriptionAre you doing all the \"right things\"?
