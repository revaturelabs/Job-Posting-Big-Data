Teck also said it plans to reduce coal production this year due to declining global steel demand. The Canadian firm had already announced plans to close the Pend Oreille Mine in Northeast Washington in mid-February as a result of lower zinc prices.About 1,000 employee and 400 contractor positions will be eliminated by the end of 2009, with most of the cuts occurring in the first quarter. Teck expects to take a charge of approximately $35 million in the first quarter for severance and other related costs associated with the reduction.SPOKANEStanley is chairman of Sterling SavingsHeidi Stanley has been promoted to chairman of Sterling Savings Bank’s board of directors.
