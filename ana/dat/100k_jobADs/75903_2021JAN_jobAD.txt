And on such an occasion, some might ask, Well, do books really need a day? Here in the publishing industry, we certainly think so. In fact, books are perhaps more important than ever, given recent trends in which reading has become portrayed as the pastime of ivory tower academics, out of touch with the real world, rather than the tool with which we better every aspect of our lives, from education to, as some studies show, improving empathy.The writer William Nicholson once wrote “We read to know we’re not alone.” He credited these words to CS Lewis, the author responsible for one of the most beloved fictional universes in literary history. They succinctly describe the reason why reading has never fallen out of fashion. Despite the drastic changes to entertainment brought about by the digital age. With sales for George Orwell and Margaret Atwood soaring since a certain president’s recent inauguration, it shows that people still go to the same place they always have for comfort.Everyone remembers the book they read as a child that changed the way they thought. They remember the time they encountered a world they wanted to live in more than their own. They remember people who don’t exist as well as they remember the people in their own lives. Everyone has that book (or books!) they’ll never sell, that moves from one home to another like a member of the family.Here, at Atwood Tate, we’re proud to work with all kinds of publishers, helping people find their dream jobs in an industry that couldn’t be more head-over-heels in love with books.
