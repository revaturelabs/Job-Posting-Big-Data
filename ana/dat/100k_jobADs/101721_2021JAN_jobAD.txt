Especially for younger teens, these seasonal employment opportunities may be their first experience in the workforce, and their first real opportunity to learn how, and why, to always put safety first.According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH):In 2015, 403 workers under the age of 24 died from work-related injuries.In 2015, there were 24 deaths to workers under 18 years of age.In 2014, the rate of work-related injuries treated in emergency departments for workers, ages 15–19, was 2.18 times greater than the rate for workers 25 years of age and older.NIOSH and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) remind young workers of their own responsibilities when beginning a job:Learn your rights and responsibilities that apply to safety and health where you work. Ask a coworker, school counselor, or your boss about this or read the employee bulletin board or handbook.Ask your boss about safety training and learn about the dangers before you start a job or a new task.Report any health and safety hazards to your supervisor.Find out what to do if you get hurt at work.Know and follow all safety rules and instructions.Find out what to do in an emergency from your supervisor or coworkers.For teens with more of an entrepreneurial spirit, the idea of a babysitting business is more appealing than a summer assignment at an established company. Understanding how to keep themselves, and their younger charges, safe is paramount for any teen looking towards childcare to earn extra income.
