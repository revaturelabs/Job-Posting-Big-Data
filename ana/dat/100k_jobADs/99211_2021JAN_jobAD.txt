In some cases, these decreases were offset by other tax increases on working families.Offshore oil and gas exploration has plummeted by more than 50 percent since the lawsuits were filed.We have to turn this around, and fortunately, the answers are on the table. Legal reform is one of the key components of our Jobs and Opportunity Agenda for Louisiana, and this research shows why ending lawsuit abuse and creating a fair and predictable legal system is critical to achieving a new vision for Louisiana. As for the coastal lawsuits, the answer is obvious. We must abandon this ill-fated lawsuit strategy, if we want to stop the stagnation and bring jobs and opportunity back to Louisiana rather than continue to stagnate. We can’t expect to catch up with the rest of the nation if we continue taking this overtly hostile approach with job creators.To keep up the momentum and build a powerful citizen movement, we also need help from all Louisianans to get the word out. Talk to your friends, family and neighbors and educate them about the critical issues facing our state. Together, we can upend a broken status quo and make our state rich with jobs and opportunity for all.Categories: Featured, Jobs & Opportunity, Legal/Tort/Regulatory Reform, News & Events, Pelican Site FeaturedBy pelicanadmin17 October 23, 2019Share this postShare with FacebookShare with Google+Share with TwitterShare with PinterestShare with LinkedInPost navigationPreviousPrevious post:Louisiana Leadership Not Helping TaxpayersNextNext post:Constitutional Reform Needed to Bring Jobs and Opportunity to LouisianaRelated postsCelebrate School Choice Week with PelicanJanuary 25, 20212021 starts with a whimperJanuary 14, 2021Social worker sues state for opportunity to help kids in needJanuary 12, 2021Pelican weighs in on major SCOTUS property rights caseJanuary 8, 2021Last Jobs Report of the Year A Mixed BagDecember 29, 2020Update on Louisiana Emergency Declaration LawsuitDecember 23, 2020Recent ArticlesCelebrate School Choice Week with PelicanJanuary 25, 20212021 starts with a whimperJanuary 14, 2021Social worker sues state for opportunity to help kids in needJanuary 12, 2021Pelican weighs in on major SCOTUS property rights caseJanuary 8, 2021Last Jobs Report of the Year A Mixed BagDecember 29, 2020Update on Louisiana Emergency Declaration LawsuitDecember 23, 2020Recent CommentsSearchSearch:Join Our NewsletterStay up to date with the Pelican Institute newsletter.NameFirst LastEmailZip CodeZIP / Postal CodePelican InstitutePrivacy PolicyEmail:info@pelicaninstitute.orgPhone number:(504) 500-0506Find us on:FacebookTwitterYouTubeRecent NewsCelebrate School Choice Week with PelicanJanuary 25, 20212021 starts with a whimperJanuary 14, 2021Social worker sues state for opportunity to help kids in needJanuary 12, 2021© Pelican Institute - 2019.
