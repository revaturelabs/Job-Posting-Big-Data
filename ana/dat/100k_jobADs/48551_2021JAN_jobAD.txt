Briggs said that 70% of oil and gas jobs in the state are at risk. He added that would be a massive financial hit for the state. Briggs said:“If you look at that 70% number that is putting 23,000 people at risk of losing their job and over two billion in wages that will be pulled out of Louisiana’s economy”The downturn in the industry started earlier this year with a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, but was mostly a result of the COVID-19 closures and quarantines. There was an international agreement through OPEC and Russia to cut production by 10 million barrels a day, but that hasn't been enough to stabilize the industry.Briggs said the biggest thing that could help save the industry would be for the economy to reopen, and come back.Beware of These 50 Jobs That Might Vanish in the Next 50 YearsFiled Under: Coronavirus (COVID-19), COVID, Gas Industry, Louisiana economy, oil and gas, Oil IndustryCategories: Health, Louisiana NewsCommentsLeave A CommentBack To TopFeaturedWin a Trip to Florida with the Winter Warm-Up!Recommended For YouInformationEEOMarketing and Advertising SolutionsPublic FileNeed AssistanceFCC ApplicationsReport an InaccuracyTermsVIP TermsFAQContest RulesPrivacy PolicyExercise My Data RightsContactShreveport Business ListingsFollow Us2021 96.5 KVKI, Townsquare Media, Inc.
