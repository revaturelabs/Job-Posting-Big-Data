These disputes often relate to high-profile projects in the UK and overseas and typically involve complex issues in the law of tort, contract and restitution. Chambers is based in modern premises just outside the Temple.Chambers’ areas of practice are dynamic and challenging. The relevant principles of law are constantly developing and the technical complexity of disputes requires thorough analytical skills. In their first years of practice, tenants can expect earnings equivalent to those in other top commercial sets.Our barristers regularly appear in the UK courts including the Technology and Construction Court, the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court, the Privy Council. We are also frequently instructed to act in international hearings across Europe, the Middle East, AsiaPacific, Africa and the Caribbean. Our expertise in alternative dispute resolution covers both UK and international arbitration, adjudication (statutory and contractual), mediation, dispute review boards and expert determination. Members regularly publish books, articles and journals, such as Keating on Construction Contracts (the leading textbook in its field).VacanciesSave to dashboardPupillageLondonOpen/ongoingView all vacanciesWe are exhibiting at:National Pupillage FairTARGETjobs presents the UK's most established National Pupillage Fair.
