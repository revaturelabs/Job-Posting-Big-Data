The Spanish giants would have to negotiate Koeman’s release with the KNVB.Ronald Koeman is the main candidate to occupy the managerial role once the dismissal of Quique Setién is made official. The Dutchman is ready to leave his position as the coach of the national team of the Netherlands, unlike previous year.

ThanksHe was awful at Everton.https://footballwhispers.com/blog/ronald-koeman-why-did-it-go-so-wrong-at-everton/He has not been great with the Dutch national team.

There we go.I find it astonishing.But those who matter clearly think it’s a wise move.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/17/ronald-koeman-to-be-appointed-new-barcelona-managerLoading...ReplyBob Cobb III says:	August 18, 2020 at 03:21	He was bad at Everton but your ignorance about the situation at the Dutch NT is evident. The team was flat out AWFUL before Koeman arrived, easily the worst they’d been in 3 decades. His tactics and approach are one of the main reasons the team has become at least somewhat respectable again.Not saying that means he’ll do well for Barcelona, but try doing some research so your posts make some level of sense.Loading...ReplyLeave a ReplyClick here to cancel reply.Name (required)E-Mail (required)Website (Optional)« Werder Bremen and Manchester United confirm Chong loanDe Jong fires Sevilla into Europa League final »Dutch Football News 24/7Follow our new Twitter accountMy TweetsFootball-Oranje is on YoutubeTop Posts & PagesFrimpong set to sign for Bayer Leverkusen	Zirkzee to join Everton or Parma	Eredivisie Predictions & Betting 20/21: Round 19	Bruno Fernandes full of praise for Van de Beek	Manchester City end Arzani's loan with Utrecht	Super-sub Mauro Junior inspires PSV to win at Emmen	Castaignos continues his career in Greece	Eredivisie Round 18 Team of the Week	Willem II sack Koster	Newcastle United enquire about PSV full-back	Privacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
