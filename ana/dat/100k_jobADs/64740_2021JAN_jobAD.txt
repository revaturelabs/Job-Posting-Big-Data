Speaking at Guyhead Credai's Virtual Property Show, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said the government would allow lands for affordable housing under the Agricultural Land Act 63 AAA to make more land easily available for affordable housing construction and fulfill the dream of a common man by building such dwellings on a large scale.The builtup area will be increasedVijay Rupani said that for the purpose of making affordable housing bigger and building three-room kitchen houses, instead of 80 square meters of built-up area, 90 square meters of built-up units will now be included in affordable housing. This will allow people to find larger homes in this category. As a result, the beneficiary families will now get comfortable and more spacious accommodation.Consideration of interest relief on chargeable FSIRupani, in another announcement to boost the construction sector, said that currently chargeable FSI is taken at the time of construction approval, but as such construction work with chargeable FSI has to be done later, the FSI will be taken uniformly across the state. In this context, the state government is also considering giving interest relief, he added.આ સંપૂર્ણ માહિતી ગુજરાતીમાં વાંચવા અહીં ક્લિક કરો.More than 200 projects will be seen onlineAjay Patel, president of Guyhead Credai, said it was the first time an online property show had been organized in view of Corona's condition.
