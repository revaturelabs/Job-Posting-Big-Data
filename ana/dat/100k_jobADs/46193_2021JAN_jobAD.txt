When running queries to count the number of records yet to be sliced, we see the counts are moving along. We noticed that after the job completed, the next time it started up; there were a large number of allocation records waiting to be sliced again. Why is it taking longer for the job to finish?EnvironmentRelease: AllComponent: Clarity Time SlicingResolutionHere are some items to check regarding Time Slicing job slownessWas there a XOG Write action to add many projects with allocations and assignments?New data will need to be sliced for various existing time slice definitions.Was there a change in the Clarity Base Calendar?The Base Calendar controls resource availability and this is taken into the calculation for the allocation and assignment slices. If this calendar is changed, the data will be triggered for a re-slice and depending on the amount of data to be re-sliced.Was there a change on an investment team page to the start/finish dates?This will cause the project plan to realign and force the job the reprocess the changes to reflect the change. When users change the allocation start and/or finish date from the team staff page, this will cause a reslice for every member on this team. A better solution would be to change the allocation from the Team > Resource > Allocations tab rather than the Team > Staff page as this will not cause a project date realignment.Did a 'rollover' occur or were slice definitions updated?A rollover occurs at regular intervals based on the Time Slice definition. There are weekly and monthly roll over intervals. The Expiration Date on the Time Slice definition will indicate when the next 'rollover' is to occur. Editing a Time Slice definition will erase the data for that slice; however the data will be replaced when the Time Slicing job is next run. The date range of the slice definition and the amount of data that needs to be re-sliced will impact the amount of time required for the Time Slicing job to finish. If you are modifying Time Slice definitions, be sure to only update one; let the job run to completion and then update another slice definition. This will help to minimize the amount of time required for the job to complete.Have the DBA check/monitor the database to see if there are was any contention around the time of the occurrence.There could be other processes running that is competing with the Time Slicing jobFeedbackthumb_up Yesthumb_down NoPowered by"
