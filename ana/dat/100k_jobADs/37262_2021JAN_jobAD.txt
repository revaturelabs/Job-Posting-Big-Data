My name is Lindsey Kratochwill and im looking for a full time well paying job!Moore, OklahomaLast seen 6 days agoPay negotiableWant to connect with Lindsey?Get Started NowHouse sitter in Moore, OklahomaWho I Am:Hey my name is Lindsey. I'm hoping to find a housesitter work opportunity in Moore, Oklahoma. I'm aiming to utilize my experience as a Housesitter. My availability is flexible, i would work 7 days a week to possibly get 40 hours or i could work 5 days out the week and hours are negotiable! I stay in Moore, Oklahoma and have a car of my own so transportation is not a worry. I currently have a job and a pretty steady history of being loyal and working long term. My current place of hire is a dispensary in Norman.... i do smoke medically but i would take all precautions and be very respectful of your wishes and your home. My current job does pay me $14/hour and with my building up and asking for raises i would like to be matched but of course it’s negotiable. My reasoning for leaving would be; I pretty much work as an owner/high-status manager, and have to babysit my coworkers and literal owners. All product that flows in i take care of by stocking, making it available on our menu, pricing, taking pictures, then of course the regular sweeping and mopping. Im searching for a job that has structure and with peoplethat are willing to work their part based off their title.... Working by myself with a set of tasks assigned to me would be more than okay. I’ve been working at my current job for around a year now and my previous job i came very close to spending two years with them. I was working at a daycare, i was a main teacher, substitute, and part time teacher! i worked with all age groups and even picked up babysitting jobs every other weekend! After i stopped working there, i had such a close bond with a family that i was their full time babysitter for a year which included watching over the house, animals, and children, if nights got late for the parents i would even stay the night with the kids (aged 2-4). Being their babysitter also included driving my car or the car they would provide, keeping track of money for the kids and planning fun days for them! I have small business experience, daycare experience as well as house care experience and i would love to help you and your family out.Booking An Appointment:Send a message and I should reply shortly. 405-543-...ServicesResponsibilities include:Mail collectionPet feedingPlant careGarbage/recyclingSnow clearingShare This ProfileConnect with FacebookSimilar Profiles NearbyNear Moore, OklahomaMaleah BWill Watch Your Beautiful Home located in Edmond, OkSophia TA friendly and upbeat young adult hoping to house sit and help with daily care around the property as needed!Ronnie TAmazing House Sitter for HireKay MSeeking Oklahoma City House and Petsitter JobsSophie RRespectful, Mature, Responsible House Sitter!Find House Sitting in Moore, OklahomaValley Brook•Del City•Smith Village•Norman•Tinker Afb•Oklahoma City•Midwest City•Newcastle•Forest ParkMore in Moore, OklahomaElder Care•Babysitting•Pet Sitting•Housekeeping•House SittingWant to connect with Lindsey?Get Started NowSimilar Profiles NearbyNear Moore, OklahomaMaleah BWill Watch Your Beautiful Home located in Edmond, OkSophia TA friendly and upbeat young adult hoping to house sit and help with daily care around the property as needed!Ronnie TAmazing House Sitter for HireKay MSeeking Oklahoma City House and Petsitter JobsSophie RRespectful, Mature, Responsible House Sitter!Top Cities for HouseSitter.comCanadaHouse Sitting TorontoHouse Sitting CalgaryHouse Sitting EdmontonHouse Sitting VancouverHouse Sitting OttawaHouse Sitting MontrealHouse Sitting VictoriaHouse Sitting WinnipegHouse Sitting SaskatoonHouse Sitting BramptonUSAHouse Sitting Los AngelesHouse Sitting HoustonHouse Sitting Las VegasHouse Sitting San AntonioHouse Sitting ChicagoHouse Sitting TucsonHouse Sitting AtlantaHouse Sitting BrooklynHouse Sitting San DiegoHouse Sitting PhoenixHouseSitter.com ServicesHome Check UpsHome SitterHouse And Pet SitterHouse And Pet Sitting JobsHouse CarersHouse SittingHouse Sitting JobsHouse Sitting OpportunitiesHouse Sitting RentalHouse Sitting RentalsHousesitting JobsLocal House SitterLocal House Sitting JobsReliable House SitterTrusted House SittersHouse Sitter Jobs DirectoryHouse Sitters DirectoryHouseSitter.com is a Part of the CareGuide FamilyCanadianNanny.caSitter.comHousekeeper.comPetSitter.comElderCare.comHouseSitter.comChildCareAdvantage.comNanny LaneMeetAnAccountant.comMeetACarpenter.comMeetAChef.comMeetAnElectrician.comMeetAnEngineer.comMeetAGardener.comMeetAHandyman.comMeetALandscaper.comMeetAMechanic.comMeetAPainter.comMeetAPhotographer.comMeetAPlumber.comMeetAProgrammer.comMeetARenovator.comMeetARoofer.comMeetASalesman.comMeetASecurityGuard.comMeetATruckDriver.comMeetATutor.comMeetAVideographer.comMeetAWebDeveloper.comMeetAWriter.comContact1100 – 119 Spadina AveToronto, ONM5V 2L1Payroll ServicesNanny Tax & Payroll ServicesNeed Help?Help CenterSecurity InfoHouse Sitting Cost GuideSocialBlogTwitterFacebookLinkedInPrivacy Policy·Terms of Service·Cancellation Policy© 2021 CareGuide Inc."
