We were in a time of transition and God was clear that I needed to focus on school, ministry, and home life. A lot has changed since then. My husband is thriving at his job which was the reason for our move and transition back to North Carolina in the first place. My daughter is growing and exploring new things. Not only does she read now, she regularly writes her own stories or songs. I have turned over responsibilities for the Women‚Äôs Mentoring Ministry that I was leading, and graduated from seminary in the spring. Early next week, I will turn in my first manuscript to Zondervan publishers! Though it has been challenging, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that quitting my job was not such a bad idea.After a summer of rest, it seems that my family is again at a point of transition. I have been asking God, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù My daughter is now attending a new school. We are worshipping at a new church. I didn‚Äôt want to jump into anything else new right away, particularly because I have a couple major writing projects that need my attention over the next year. Thankfully, God has clearly answered the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù question by creating an assignment just for me.Next Thursday, I will begin part-time work at my beloved alma mater, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary (Charlotte campus). I will be working under my academic advisor, Dr. Rodney Cooper, as the new Assistant Director of the Center for the Development of Evangelical Leadership (CDEL). I am excited about this opportunity to revitalize and expand our center, while building partnerships with others who are teaching and training our current evangelical leaders and raising up the next generation of leaders. Additionally, I am excited about the opportunities to lecture and mentor students in our Christian Leadership program. I‚Äôll be keeping you posted about what I learn on this new journey.Are there any new things coming your way?¬© Natasha Sistrunk Robinson 2014Rate this:Please Share this:FacebookTwitterPinterestEmailLike this:Like Loading...RelatedPosted byNatasha Sistrunk Robinson September 25, 2014 September 25, 2014 Posted inUncategorized	Published by Natasha Sistrunk Robinson	Servant of Jesus.
