defence and security review.At its Prestwick base 55 posts are being axed with a further 30 being shed at RAF Kinloss in Moray.Alan Fraser, managing drector of BAE Systems' regional aircraft, said: \"Since the publication of the Strategic Defence and Security Review, we have been working with our colleagues in other parts of BAE Systems and within our own business here at Prestwick to understand the implications of this announcement.\"BAE Systems has recently received a contract termination for customer convenience notice for the Nimrod MRA4 programme and as a result this has regrettably led us to initiating consultation regarding 55 potential job losses at our Prestwick site.\"The company is cutting more than 1,350 jobs across Britain because the Harrier and Nimrod jet programmes are being cancelled.Kevin Taylor, managing director of BAE Systems military air solutions, said: \"This announcement is designed to ensure we remain competitive as we actively pursue a number of
