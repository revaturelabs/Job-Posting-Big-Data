The only way to re-create the cron job is to create or save a cron entry - however, for a server running in production, you cannot edit any existing cron entries without...xenforo.comReplyReactions: Jake B.Post replyInsert quotes…Similar threadsZQuestionXF 2.2 cron job that removes deleted images from DBZeroGDec 9, 2020XenForo questions and supportReplies1Views90Dec 9, 2020ZeroGZFixed xf:run-jobs may never stopSimAug 3, 2020Resolved bug reportsReplies6Views446Sep 1, 2020XF Bug BotRXF 2.2 Cron job and timezoneRobert9Sep 26, 2020XenForo development discussionsReplies3Views145Sep 27, 2020Robert9RRXF 2.2 How to make a cron-job ?Robert9Sep 23, 2020XenForo development discussionsReplies0Views163Sep 23, 2020Robert9RQuestionXF 2.1 Batch update users results in MySQL overloadduderuudAug 13, 2020Troubleshooting and problemsReplies7Views180Aug 14, 2020duderuudShare:Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Tumblr WhatsApp Email Share LinkHomeForumsXenForo bug reportsResolved bug reportsTerms and rulesPrivacy policyHelpHomeRSSForum software by XenForo® © 2010-2021 XenForo Ltd.Buy XenForo Try a demo@XenForo XenForoProductsForumMedia galleryResource managerEnhanced searchImportersSalesFeaturesBuy XenForoPre-sales questionsAdmin demoCustomersAccount areaGet supportCommunityLicense validationLicense agreementHelpManualDeveloper docsHelpContact usThis site uses cookies to help personalise content, tailor your experience and to keep you logged in if you register.By continuing to use this site, you are consenting to our use of cookies.Accept Learn more…Top"
