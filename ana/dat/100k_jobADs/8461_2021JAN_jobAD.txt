(DEI) has introduced a new cost savings kit that includes one roll of 2” x 25’ thermal pipe wrap and four 8” stainless steel locking ties. The combination kit ensures a secure fit regardless of use – heavy duty, towing, race, motorsports, street rod or muscle cars, and motorcycles. The locking ties are designed for pipes up to 2” inches in diameter or, for larger diameter pipes two locking ties can be joined.Primary uses include spot wrapping header tubes to protect plug boots, wires and vital engine components; to wrap sections of exhaust, crossover and tail pipe to reduce heat transfer for improved cabin comfort; and to wrap turbo downpipes. The kit is also ideal for motorcycle pipes to protect clothing, boots, and exposed skin from serious burn; all while improving performance.DEI’s Pipe Wrap & Locking Ties Kit includes a 2” x 25’ length of wrap and is available in: black (#010119), tan (#010122), or titanium (#010123) for a carbon fiber look.For more information on DEI’s Pipe Wrap & Locking Ties Kit or other DEI thermal protection products visit DEI’s booth at the 2012 SEMA show (#20113), go to www.designengineering.com, call 800-264-9472, or e-mail: sales@DesignEngineering.com.Print this pageTweetRelatedDesign Engineering, Inc. celebrates 20 yearsDEI adds Garage Video Series to long list of web mediaDesign Engineering Inc. names new VP of operationsNew Design Boosts Air Conditioning PerformanceHave your say: Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
