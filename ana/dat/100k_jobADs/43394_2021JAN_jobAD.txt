Your gift will help a student like Raina, a Project Build graduate who spent a decade in and out of prison before turning her life around with help from a partnership between the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office and JobTrain. When Raina was chosen to represent her graduating class she had this to say, “JobTrain has helped to change my life for the better. I’ve learned at JobTrain that if I can find the courage to follow my dreams, the doors of opportunity become endless.” Today Raina is a member of Carpenters Union Local 217.To help JobTrain reach our goal, you may make a donation from our safe and secure donation site by CLICKING HERE, or you may contact Reshma Putnam at (650) 330-6436 or rputnam@jobtrainworks.org. Your gift will be matched by donations from JobTrain’s Board of Directors and community champions.Thank you for helping those most in need to succeed!Source: Blogspotheidi2015-01-14T09:15:13-08:00	Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!facebooktwitterlinkedinredditwhatsapptumblrpinterestvkEmailContact JobTrain1200 O' Brien DriveMenlo Park, CA 94025Phone: 650-330-6429Fax: 650-330-6401info@jobtrainworks.orgContact UsDonate NowSubscribe to eNewsletterJobTrainJobTrain transforms lives and communities in Silicon Valley.
