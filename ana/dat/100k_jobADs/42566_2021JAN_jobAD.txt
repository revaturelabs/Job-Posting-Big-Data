Depending on the job opening, additional screenings such as background checks, drug screens or credit checks may also be required prior to placement.How soon can I start working?Job availability changes on a daily basis. Once your application process is complete, you will be considered based on your preferences and your skills, and will be offered appropriate positions. If your skills are highly specialized or your preferences are highly specific, this may extend the amount of time it takes to find a suitable position for you.How often should I contact your office after I interview with you?Once you have registered with us, you are able to update your availability through our online talent portal. You may also call our office and speak to a team member, or leave a voicemail after-hours. Emailing your recruiter directly is also an option. We suggest checking in once per week, or whenever your availability, interest, preferences or requirements change significantly.How can I stay informed about open positions?Many of our positions are listed on our website. When you register with us, you will also receive periodic emails and texts regarding open jobs. These are general job updates sent to all active candidates. Remember, if you are not a fit for a specific job opening, you can still earn referral bonuses by referring candidates. You may opt-out of communication from Advent at any time.Where do I find my timesheet and employment documents?Log in to your employee portal to access your timesheet and enter your payroll hours each week. You’ll also have access to all of your important employment documents here.How often am I paid?Advent pays temporary employees on a weekly basis and offers both check card and direct deposit options.
