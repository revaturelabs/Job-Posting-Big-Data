You can view our CV advice for tips on what to include.You may also want to consider spending some time on writing a cover letter, particularly if you are applying for high-level roles.Searching for jobsIf you are new to the job market, do some research into your chosen field to understand what types of jobs are available and what you should be searching for. If you need some inspiration you may want to begin by searching by location and industry rather than keywords.If your search is returning a lot of results use filters to your advantage, but be careful not to use too many filters or be too restrictive as you may end up missing great opportunities.You should also pay particular attention to job titles, as the same position may be listed under slightly different titles.Save time by creating a saved search and enabling job alerts so that you can get alerted when new jobs are posted that match your criteria.Downloading the mobile app will let you search and apply for jobs anywhere and also receive notifications for your saved searches.Finally, not all jobs are posted online. Some employers will use our CV database to find potential candidates. To be considered for those roles you should make your CV searchable.When you make your CV searchable we'll also create you a Profile. It includes key information from your CV such as your latest job, top 10 skills and highest level of education. Making sure the information in your profile is accurate and up-to-date will improve your chances of being found for the right job.Applying for jobsDon't let a long job description full of skills put you off applying. Even if you're missing a few skills it may be possible to acquire those skills on the job, and you may have additional expertise that other applicants do not have.You may wish to tailor your CV for the jobs that you apply to in order to highlight the skills and experience you have that will be useful for the role you are applying for.After you have appliedAn employer's time may be in short supply, so don't be disheartened if you don't get a response from your application. Some jobs can receive a lot of applications.Still, if you don't hear back a follow-up email or phone call can work to your advantage - but continually chasing will not.Mobile SiteContact UsAboutNetwork PartnersTermsPrivacyCookiesAustria Change CountryUnited KingdomUnited States of AmericaAustraliaCanadaFranceGermanyMore countries...CareerBoard is a registered trademark.Â© 2021 CareerBoard.com.
