I used to work security in a nightclub, in a hip-hop night club. It was a lot of [fighting], a terrible job. It was a depressing job. I used to work in a grocery storeâ€”it was bad. 'Garbageman! To pay my university [bills], I worked as a garbage man for six months. That was not so bad, actually. That was actually one of my most fun jobs.But fans of \"Rush\" likely know those stories very well from several previous interviews and many features about the long-reigning UFC star.However, AskMen threw GSP a bit of a curveball when the conversation steered towards what he remembered about the first time he ever had sex. True to form, the shy welterweight champion didn't divulge many details about it, acknowledging it was an awkward affair.First time I had sex was, uh... (Laughs) I was awesome! (Laughs) I gave the girl five orgasms! No, no, no, I'm kidding. It was like... it was... I would rather not remember it. That's how bad it was. (Laughs)Expect the upcoming days to feature many more media rounds as St-Pierre's return at UFC 154 gains increased interest from the mainstream crowd. After more than 18 months away from the Octagon, the lineal champion will face off against interim champion Carlos Condit in a highly-anticipated title unification match on Saturday, November 17 on pay-per-view.Video Play ButtonVideos you might likeFacebook LogoTwitter LogoCopy Link IconRelatedPoirier on Conor Rematch: 'I'm Going to Be Victorious'B/R spoke to Dustin Poirier ahead of UFC 257 ðŸ‘‰MMAPoirier on Conor Rematch: 'I'm Going to Be Victorious'Kelsey McCarsonvia Bleacher ReportModestas Bukauskas vs. Michal Oleksiejczuk in the works for the UFC event on March 27MMAModestas Bukauskas vs. Michal Oleksiejczuk in the works for the UFC event on March 27Mike Heckvia MMA FightingMcGregor Wants to Fight Nate Diaz Again, Possibly for TitleMMAMcGregor Wants to Fight Nate Diaz Again, Possibly for TitleTim Danielsvia Bleacher ReportUFC Fight Island 7 PredictionsMMAUFC Fight Island 7 PredictionsAlexander K.
