Her sister Lisbet Jobs was also a ceramisist and textile designer. Together they exhibited their ceramics at the World Expo in Paris in 1937, in New York in 1939, and at the Golden Gate Exhibition in San Francisco in 1938. Due to a shortage of ceramic glaze during WWII, their brother Peer Jobs who ran a textile company transferred their designs onto textiles. Their breakthrough came with an exhibition in 1945 at the prestigious Stockholm department store NK, entitled 'When Beauty Came To The Village'.EnquirePrintEmail itemFill in this form to send us your enquiryNameEmailTelEnquiryAdd me to your email mailing listI agree to the Privacy Policy. *Fill in this form to email this item to a friendYour nameYour emailTheir nameTheir emailAdd me to your email mailing listI agree to the Privacy Policy. *Please fill in the information belowNameEmailTelCancelSOCIAL	FacebookTwitterInstagramCONTACT	07867 305451info@handofgloryantiques.com34 Market PlaceChippenhamWiltshireSN15 3HPUnited KingdomAntiques website design by ph9 web design | Antiques	Privacy / TermsClose"
