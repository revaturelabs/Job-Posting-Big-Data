Time and effort that you can be remarkably efficient with, and can short-cut in some cases.And don‚Äôt get tempted into the belief that you can change an individual massively, or give them ‚Äúa chance‚Äù to somehow fit the role, if it‚Äôs blinding the obvious that they can‚Äôt. Remember, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt train a fish to climb a tree!‚ÄùIt‚Äôs a strategic decision because, if you‚Äôve got a commitment to get a winning team, with strategies and ongoing action in this arena, you can see where you‚Äôre going, and know what you need to get there, in advance! You will bring the best of the best to you and your business rather than the best of the rest!This strategic awareness and concentration is usually avoided, either by design or default, simply because most managers get caught in the trap of recruiting in crisis ‚Äì because they decide to put a (‚Ä¶ ‚Äútemporary‚Äù, best that they can do in a crunch‚Äù) ‚Äúbum on a seat‚Äù in response to somebody leaving, or because the growth demands of the business have suddenly, sometimes urgently, shown a gap that must be filled A.S.A.P.Our unique Job Bench-marking service allows you to 0 in on the exact skills, thinking, motivation, behaviour and communication that any role requires.

Although the absolute number of people changing businesses rose by about 70,000 in the year to February 2019, so too did the size of the entire workforce, and so the proportion of the workforce thatchanged jobs rose only slightly, to 8.5% in February 2019.All industries ‚Äì Workforce (Feb 2019) = 12,740,400Changed business in the past year = 1,078,300Proportion of workforce that changed business in the past year = 8.5%*Figures from The Australian Bureau of Statistics(ABS) & AI Group economicsProportion of workforce in July 2019 that changed employer or business in the previous 12 months, by industryHospitality 17.9%Rental & Real Estate 11.7%Administrative Services 11.3%Utilities 10.3%Construction 9.7%Other Services 9.4%Retail trade 9.4%Wholesale trade 9.3%Professional Services 8.5%All Industries 8.5%Transport & Warehousing 8.3%Arts and Recreation Services 8.0%Financial & Insurance 7.6%Manufacturing 7.0%Mining 7.0%I.T., Media & Telecoms 6.9%Health Care 6.4%Education & Training 5.9%Agriculture 5.8%Public Administration 5.3%Turnover trends according to Australian HR Institute in 2018Lack of career progression/opportunities 63.2%Better pay elsewhere 48%New career opportunity 44%Poor relationship with supervisor/manager 41.1%Lack of training and development opportunities 25.3%Poor work/life balance 17.2%Personal circumstances e.g. health 16.7%Poor job design 13.8%Permanently leaving the workforce 12.9%Relocation of employee 11.8%Lack of employee voice in the organisation 11.5%Insufficient flexible work arrangements available 10.3%Poor relationship with co-workers 7.2%Physical work environment 6.6%Other 16.1%Many people are now accepting roles with an approach that the first 6 to 8 weeks is actually more like a job trial. One finding is the first 45 days of employment is a ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù period ‚Äì a great amount of staff turnover (‚Ä¶ as high as 20 percent) occurs during what we usually think of as the ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù period.So what are the most common reasons for turnover?The job was oversold by recruitersA poor on-boarding experience eroded the newcomer‚Äôs confidence in the companyLack of clarity surrounding job duties and expectations (‚Ä¶ correlating with bad or unprepared managers)To clarify, the components of turnover costs include expenses for in-house hiring, termination administrative, training and induction; as well as lost productivity from other employees filling in for vacant positions, in the early and final stages of employment.And examination of turnover costs from respective accountancy group Price Waterhouse Coopers estimates, that the cost of turnover is anywhere from a departing employee‚Äôs annual salary to 2.5 times its‚Äô equivalent.Hiring the wrong people is a costly, and potentially fatal mistake for your organisation.Experience the relief & peace of mind of getting the right people for the right roleLet's Catch up üôÇShare via:FacebookLinkedInEmailMoreOur Focus in 2020 is: To bring the best new ideas to leaders, business owners, individuals and our Community of Best Practice around the country.Recent NewsThe 8 Hidden Agents Influencing ‚Äì The Success of Your Business August 17, 2020Is running a business hard or do you just need to get organised?
