Consider yourself lucky if your workplace allows for some fun and freedom when picking your weekday wear, because some careers require classic professionalism when it comes to putting together outfits. No matter your office vibes we’ve got you covered with our take on this season’s trends, appropriate for any corporate culture!The Pant SuitAn obvious choice for the office, pant suits are so hot right now! We’re seeing well-cut suits in deep, bold colours from teal to cranberry and everything in between. We love pairing the look with a sleek black bootie for fall, and if your office is a little more casual you can swipe the blouse out for a graphic t-shirt for an edgier look.Look One:Dolce & Gabbana White Bow Shirt, $555, available at ssense.comZara Double Breasted Tailored Jacket, $129Zara Flared Flowing Trousers, $69.90Zaful Square Toe Chunky Heel Boots, $60Loewe Oversized Leather Clutch, $425, available at therealreal.comDaniel Wellington Women’s Classic Petite Sterling, $179All Season CulottesCulottes have decided they are not going anywhere for fall/winter, and we’re more than okay with that. Darker shades and thicker materials like wool will keep you seasonally appropriate throughout the colder months. Pair with pantyhose or tights as it gets chilly, or a taller slim ankle boot like we did here.Look Two:American Vintage Vacaville Dark Olive Wool Blend Cardigan, $220, available at harveynichols.comA.L.C Everly Striped Tee, $119, available at intermixonline.comKenzo Tailored Culottes, $562, available at farfetch.comSteve Madden Satisfied Corset-Lace Bootie, $180Proenza Schouler PS1 Medium Suede Satchel Bag, $2,290 available at Bergdorf GoodmanJ.Crew Layered coin necklace, $52.50Dress To ImpressJust because it’s getting colder doesn’t mean dresses are out of the equation. Keep your inner girly-girl alive by pairing your fave dresses with your favourite childhood accessory: pantyhose and knitted tights! Complete the look with a cardigan and loafers to channel your inner Blair Waldorf (or Serena VDW).Look Three:BCBG Ginnie Collared Dress, $99Comme Des Garcon Play Embroidered Logo Cardigan, $760, available at farfetch.comMonki Tights, $10Gucci Princetown Fur-Lined Leather Slippers, $1340, available at NordstromTory Burch Juliette Top Handle Satchel, $725, available at shopbop.comMarc Jacobs Wrist Watch, $410, available at yoox.com#CasualDayNo matter where you work, you probably get to have at least one casual day every so often. Jeans are the obvious pick to wear, and we love them put together with this season’s hottest items, clean white sneakers and a houndstooth blazer.
