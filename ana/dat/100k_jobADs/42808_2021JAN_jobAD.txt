The training will be directed towards sectors with a major potential for job creation such as construction, agro-business, forestry and industry.The British government will spend £14 million on the second programme, aimed at supporting women’s economic empowerment. This is intended to encourage the recruitment of women and retaining them at work.The objective is to help 10,000 young women in the urban areas to improve their income and job opportunities “so that they have greater control over their lives”.These new programmes will also support efforts to combat child, premature and forced marriage, by providing girls with alternatives “so that they can take an active part in the economy and emerge from poverty”.“Fighting against child marriage is not enough”, said Northover. “We need to work with the Mozambican government to ensure that women have other choices and are included in opportunities in the economy”.Source: BusinessSearchGeneral NewsPoverty, Hopelessness Beget Violence in Tunisia’s Suburbs12:00 amProtests have swept towns and cities throughout Tunisia for a week, often turning violent Read More »Central African Republic Begins 15-Day State of Emergency12:00 amA 15-day nationwide state of emergency began in the Central African Republic at?midnight Thursday in?response?to?rebel-inspired Read More »UN Calls Attention to Sexual Violence in Ethiopia’s Tigray Conflict12:00 amThe United Nations is urging a “zero tolerance” policy for crimes of sexual violence in Read More »Villagers Displaced by Floods, Elephants in Northern Cameroon Wait for Aid12:00 amAid groups in Cameroon say thousands of people displaced last year from flooding and Read More »Thousands of Eritrean Refugees in Tigray Desperately Short of Aid12:00 amThe U.N. refugee agency reports thousands of Eritrean refugees trapped by fighting in Ethiopia’s northern Read More »Despite US Troop Pullout, Somalia Vows to Continue Security Cooperation12:00 amThe U.S. withdrawal of troops training Somalia's elite forces has raised concerns about security and Read More »Hundreds Arrested After 3rd Night of Rioting Across Parts of Tunisia12:00 amRiots and looting were reported late Monday in a number of Tunisian towns and cities, Read More »US Military Pulls Last Troops From Somalia12:00 amThe United States military has completed withdrawing troops from Somalia, according to the U.S. Africa Read More »AdvertisementCalendarJanuary 2021MTWTFSS1 2 34 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15 16 1718 19 20 21 22 23 2425 26 27 28 29 30 31« DecSocial ProfilesMonthly ArchivesMonthly Archives Select Month January 2021 (101) December 2020 (142) November 2020 (157) October 2020 (157) September 2020 (184) August 2020 (132) July 2020 (191) June 2020 (146) May 2020 (130) April 2020 (86) March 2020 (102) February 2020 (121) January 2020 (165) December 2019 (230) November 2019 (176) October 2019 (224) September 2019 (196) August 2019 (156) July 2019 (228) June 2019 (166) May 2019 (224) April 2019 (277) March 2019 (274) February 2019 (137) January 2019 (179) December 2018 (145) November 2018 (96) October 2018 (94) September 2018 (99) August 2018 (86) July 2018 (91) June 2018 (76) May 2018 (87) April 2018 (105) March 2018 (97) February 2018 (65) January 2018 (95) December 2017 (137) November 2017 (111) October 2017 (65) September 2017 (75) August 2017 (110) July 2017 (92) June 2017 (103) May 2017 (102) April 2017 (348) March 2017 (579) February 2017 (514) January 2017 (211) December 2016 (51) November 2016 (65) October 2016 (57) September 2016 (44) August 2016 (94) July 2016 (59) June 2016 (74) May 2016 (125) April 2016 (87) March 2016 (154) February 2016 (97) January 2016 (22) December 2015 (29) November 2015 (8) October 2015 (30) September 2015 (41) August 2015 (33) July 2015 (31) June 2015 (13) May 2015 (10) April 2015 (17) March 2015 (105) February 2015 (80) January 2015 (8)Business NewsMozambique: Nyusi Inaugurates Beira Green Park12:00 amRead More »Mozambique: Mozambican Public Debt Is Now 12.37 Billion Dollars12:00 amRead More »Mozambique: Gorongosa National Park to Spend 15 Million USD On Building New Schools12:00 amRead More »Politics NewsCentral African Republic Begins 15-Day State of Emergency12:00 amRead More »Poverty, Hopelessness Beget Violence in Tunisia’s Suburbs12:00 amRead More »Surging Inter-Ethnic Violence in Sudan’s Darfur Region Leaves Hundreds Dead, Injured12:00 amRead More »Education NewsMozambique: Inflation Remained Low in September12:00 amRead More »Mozambique: Academy Must Train ‘Competent Soldiers’, Says Minister12:00 amRead More »Mozambique: Pre-University Classes Resume On Thursday12:00 amRead More »© Copyright 2020.
