This is what's on my mind.InstagramTwitterFacebookMenuAbout RamblingsAbout SJWhippOpen SearchHelp Find Joe SjobergJoe Sjoberg (pronounced SHOW-BERG) has been missing from Madison, WI since Monday, November 29th. Originally from Washington state, 22 year-old Joe Sjoberg was reported missing after he didn‚Äôt show up at work or his apartment. Joe left with his car and cell phone and nothing indicates any foul play connected with his disappearance.I have personally never met Joe, but he is the younger brother of two guys, Rob and Pat, that I swam with at Beloit College for several years. Because of the fact that there are not many tangible leads in Joe‚Äôs disappearance, the most important tool to use in finding Joe Sjoberg is word of mouth. Joe‚Äôs family and friends have launched an online amber alert through Facebook, Twitter, and various other social media outlets. Through these platforms, detailed information about Joe‚Äôs car and last known whereabouts, photos of Joe, ‚ÄúJoe is missing‚Äù fliers, and the latest information/leads have been shared quickly and viewed by a large audience. The more people who are aware of the situation and pass along the information, the quicker we find Joe Sjoberg.That‚Äôs where you come into play. Even if you have never met Joe Sjoberg or have no direct connection to his family or friends, just sharing the information goes such a long way. As I said before, the more people who are aware of Joe Sjoberg‚Äôs disappearance, the better the chances of finding Joe sooner rather than later. Here are some simple things you can do to help find Joe Sjoberg:Tweet the information. Here is a simple phrase you can tweet: Please RT, #JoeSjoberg has gone missing in WI. Please help us find him. http://bit.ly/ieE12pCheck out the Help Us Find Joe Sjoberg Facebook page.Join the Help Joe Missing Facebook group.Post a ‚ÄúJoe is Missing‚Äù flier.Look out for Joe‚Äôs license plates.If you know something or see something related to Joe Sjoberg, contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014.Thank you so much for taking the time to read this post.
