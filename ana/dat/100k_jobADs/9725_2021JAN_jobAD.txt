I have spent five years abroad in South Korea at an elementary and middle school academy (one of the franchises) and currently, I am working part time at a language school in Birmingham.My job searches haven't really turned up much, but for the jobs that I have found, such as INTO or some positions at colleges, I haven't had much success.What kind of career paths are there into full time work in the UK? Is it a case of freelancing at language schools for a while before becoming more employable?Back to topbogratJoined: 12 Nov 2014Posts: 331Posted: Fri Mar 03, 2017 2:50 am Post subject:I'd have thought getting pre-sessional work at unis in the summer and work your way up to full time.Back to topLH123Joined: 13 Jun 2010Posts: 61Posted: Sat Mar 04, 2017 4:09 pm Post subject:Hi jphThese are the sectors available to you:ESL in private language academiesYou know the deal: teaching 'General English' mixed with various other exam preparation, conversation, grammar (etc..) classes to adults in language academies. There are good ones and bad ones. There are many more opportunities in the big cities, and more going on in the south of England than anywhere else. With a CELTA, 5 years and a Masters you would be on track to becoming a Senior Teacher, ADOS, DOS and perhaps school principal in the future - assuming you did a good job, were well-liked and got in at the right place at the right time.

FE/ESOL is a turbulent job market, as it is mostly dependent on fickle government grants. The ESOL sector has its own set of qualifications and certificates, so your CELTA+MA is likely to be less recognised and acknowledged - although they are far from value-less.

ESOL is for you...EAL in the state sectorThe state sector employs English as an Additional Language teachers/coordinators to work with first and second generation migrant children who do not use English at home. Often, but not always, they will require QTS. This is usually seen as an offshoot of Special Educational Needs, and so academic support as opposed to a full-blown academic subject. Accordingly, the pay won't be great, but you will get a good contract and lots of holidays.

This will require quite a lot of start-up work: building up clients, establishing a niche, figuring out rules and systems which work for you, having your own transport, etc...

As far as all those jobs I've seen on TEFL.com, a lot of them are summer temp jobs, do a lot of them turn into more permanent work?Also, with a lot of the pre-sessional posts, it seems that they prefer candidates to have a lot of experience before they offer jobs to them. Should I just apply to any and everything anyway or is that a waste of time?Sorry for sounding like a total noob...Back to topnomad soulJoined: 31 Jan 2010Posts: 11454Location: The real worldPosted: Thu Mar 09, 2017 5:49 pm Post subject:Also...

It would be financially ruinous for academies to hire everyone on permanent contracts, so they keep it flexible by paying people to work only when there is work to do.However, when the academies have someone that they want to keep (be it a specialist in a certain area, a very good teacher or someone with some sort of managerial responsibility) then they will (or at least should) employ them permanently. These permanent positions are not advertised on tefl.com as often, because they are nearly always filled from existing pools of staff (who were taken on initially as zero-hours or fixed-term). So, those temporary jobs you see advertised are foot-in-the-door type deals. As I said in my last post, though, some are more promising than others. I would look at larger schools/organisations - there are far more opportunities for sideways/upwards career progression. This is also something worth asking about during the application/interview process - it's perfectly acceptable to say 'I'm looking for a permanent contract in the future, might this be a possibility further down the line?' With a CELTA+MA & 5 years you have some currency in the ESL job market.Pre-sessional EAP adverts will normally ask for experience, but when it comes to the crunch they will take someone with a MA/DELTA with no experience if they have to (better to have a teacher with no prior experience than to not have a teacher at all). Believe me, hiring for EAP is difficult - there are not as many MA/DELTA qualified people out there willing to work in the UK in the summer as you might think. If I were you, I would apply for everything and see what turns up.And, as nomadsoul says, network like crazy. Go to the British Council teaching seminars, English UK conferences, etc... All of that is very valuable.Back to topjph_1985Joined: 23 Feb 2017Posts: 3Posted: Wed Mar 15, 2017 4:56 pm Post subject:Thanks a lot nomad soul and Lh123.I'll definitely take your advice going forward![/quote]Back to topDisplay posts from previous: All Posts1 Day7 Days2 Weeks1 Month3 Months6 Months1 Year Oldest FirstNewest FirstJob Discussion Forums Forum Index -> United Kingdom All times are GMTPage 1 of 1Jump to: Select a forum Where to Begin----------------General DiscussionNewbie ForumCurrent Events ForumTechnology ForumOnline Teaching Forum Africa Forums----------------General Africa Forum Asia Forums----------------CambodiaChina (Job-related Posts Only)China (Off-Topic)Hong KongIndiaIndonesiaJapanMalaysiaPhilippinesSingaporeTaiwanThailandGeneral Asia ForumVietnam Caribbean Forums----------------General Caribbean Forum Europe Forums----------------Czech RepublicFranceGermanyGreeceItalyMacedonia and the BalkansPolandRomaniaRussia & C.I.S.SpainTurkeyUkraineUnited KingdomGeneral Europe Forum Latin America Forums----------------ArgentinaBrazilChileColombiaCosta RicaMexicoMexico (off-topic)PeruGeneral Latin America Forum The Middle East Forums----------------BahrainEgyptIsraelKuwaitOmanQatarSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesGeneral Middle East Forum North America Forums----------------General North America Forum Oceania----------------Australia/New ZealandYou cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forumThis page is maintained by the one and only Dave Sperling.Contact Dave's ESL CafeCopyright © 2018 Dave Sperling.
