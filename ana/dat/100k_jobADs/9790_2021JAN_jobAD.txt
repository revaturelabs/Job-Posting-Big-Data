In total, 775 jobs will be created through these investments, which will total £393million.From today, local businesses and local workers will be able to find out about contracts and job opportunities at Teesworks by visiting www.teesworks.co.uk.In a further bid to support local businesses, Mayor Houchen worked with Middlesbrough-based Better brand agency to develop the new Teesworks brand, established to appeal to both international investors and local workers in Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool, and a new site entrance will also be built by the end of the year.Mayor Houchen said: “My 12-month plan for the former steelworks is a plan for local people and local businesses to create jobs, jobs and more jobs. Due to the sheer scale of the site, the numbers are huge and there is nothing like this anywhere else in the UK.“More than 200 local jobs have already been created on the site, but this is just the beginning. Over the next year, we will go on to create hundreds more real jobs for real people in our communities. We own the land, we have the keys, the diggers are in place and we are getting on with the job we promised to the former steelworkers, some of which are already back on site in new jobs.“We want businesses to know what opportunities are coming up so they can bid for them and support jobs in Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool, which is more important than ever as we recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Our new website, www.teesworks.co.uk, will do exactly that and help us match local people with the right vacancy.“With this exciting new phase for the site and investment in the pipeline on a scale that has not been seen before in this region, we felt it was time for a new identity to tell our story and showcase our potential to investors across the world as well as real people in Teesside, which is why we’ve launched Teesworks.“By the end of the year, we will also have built a new and impressive entrance to the site. This will be our shop window to the world, allowing us to wow local people and investors alike, inspiring current and future generations to train and apply for the high skilled jobs that we are creating“The hundreds of jobs we are creating and the investment we are bringing in will help us change the skyline of Teesside forever in the biggest demolition programme this region has ever seen. This is a site with a proud history and one which has touched the lives of so many of the people of Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool, and we can make it a site they are proud of again.”Councillor Mary Lanigan, Leader of Redcar & Cleveland Borough Council, said: “We have a world class industrial site and a first rate workforce and it is time to unleash our potential to the full. It has taken years of hard work to get this stage and now we’re knuckling down with our partners to make sure this site is even more attractive to investors here in the UK and right across the globe. Investing in this industrial centre has the potential to bring thousands of first class jobs to our borough for decades to come and we are fully determined to do all it takes to make sure that potential becomes reality.Visit the websites of our member authoritiesDarlingtonRedcar & ClevelandHartlepoolStockton on TeesMiddlesbroughSign up to our newsletterSubscribe to our mailing listName*Email Address*Please tell us who you are* Select...
