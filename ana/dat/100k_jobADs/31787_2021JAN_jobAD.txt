A notice of infringing material (\"Notice\") must be sent to the agent we have designated with the Copyright Office:John Delli VenneriAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers3 Park AvenueNew York, New York 10016To comply with the Copyright Act, a Notice must be in writing and must include the following:Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of the works;Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;A statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and made under penalty of perjury, and that you are the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; andA physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.When we receive a Notice that complies with the Copyright Act, we will remove the identified material immediately. We will promptly take reasonable steps to inform the user who posted the allegedly infringing material (the “alleged infringer”) of the Notice and subsequent removal. The alleged infringer may then provide us with a counter notice (\"Counter Notice”) that the initial infringement notice was erroneous. To comply with the Copyright Act, the Counter Notice must be in writing and must include the following:Identification of the material removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;A statement under penalty of perjury that the alleged infringer has a good faith belief that the material was removed or access to it disabled as a result of error;The alleged infringer’s name, address, and telephone number;A statement of consent to jurisdiction in federal district court and that the alleged infringer consents to service of process from the complaining party or its agent; andA physical or electronic signature of the alleged infringer.Upon receipt of a Counter Notice that complies with the Copyright Act, we will notify the sender of the Notice of the Counter Notice and restore the material within 10 to 14 business days, unless the sender of the Notice informs us that the sender of the Notice has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the allegedly infringing party from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Our Site.TrademarksASME, the ASME logo and other ASME indicia of source used on Our Site are owned by ASME (“ASME Trademarks”). You may not use any ASME Trademark without our prior written consent. You may not use any ASME Trademark in connection with any products or services that do not belong to us, or in any manner likely to cause confusion about the source of any product or service, that implies that ASME endorses any third-party product or service, or that disparages or discredits ASME. You agree not to register any domain names containing any ASME Trademark.If you are an official ASME unit or group, contact ASME Creative Services at 212-591-7081 for information regarding appropriate ASME Trademark use. For third-party inquiries or legal questions about the ASME Trademarks, please contact the ASME Executive Office at 212-591-7153.Linking Policy; Frames, Metatags and LinksThe following policies for Our Site’s link management will help to steer third-party and internal link requests.

You may not use metatags or any other “hidden text” that incorporates ASME Trademarks without our prior written consent. ASME invites companies to link to Our Site but only if the link is made in good faith and is not derogatory in nature. Any link to Our Site or any of the individual web pages contained in them should open in a new browser window. Links to Our Site should be in the form of hypertext that says \"ASME\" or \"The American Society of Mechanical Engineers\" and does not use any ASME logo or design. Please let us know if you link to Our Site by contacting us at Webmaster@asme.org.If you link to Our Site, you may not place the link on a web site with content that is libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, illegal or otherwise objectionable, or place the link in a manner that would imply ASME’s sponsorship, endorsements or approval of another party’s site or activities, constitute or encourage a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or otherwise give rise to liability or violate any applicable law or regulation.Links to Third Parties from Our SiteASME does not link to third-party web sites or non-ASME entities as a general rule, except for content partners and Sponsors. ASME does not generally provide reciprocal linking (i.e., trading links), but there may be exceptions in the case of links to sites that are informational in nature. These sites may include travel, hotel, entertainment and historical sites in the areas where ASME business or activities take place.We do not control other sites or their content, and you should read the privacy policies and terms of use that govern your use of other sites. The inclusion of links on Our Site, including links to the websites of our Sponsors, does not imply ASME’s endorsement of that site, the organization operating the site, or any products or services offered by the operator of that site.Language Translation DisclaimerTranslations of ASME web sites are done using a third-party service provider (Motionpoint, Inc.). Neither ASME nor any agency, officer, or employee of ASME warrants the accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of any information translated by this system and will not be liable for any losses caused by any reliance on the accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of the translation. While every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the translation, portions may be incorrect. Any person or entity who relies on information obtained from the system does so at his or her own risk.Email Alias DisclaimerASME offers its Members an email alias. The alias is a simple \"store and forward\" mechanism that accepts email sent to the alias name and forwards it to the Member’s actual email address. Once an email alias is issued to a Member, ASME makes no guarantees about the future privacy of the alias. ASME has taken measures to protect Members from spam in the form of adding third-party spam-blocking services; however, because the software cannot guarantee complete spam blocking, Members must take sole responsibility for protecting against publication or misuse of their email aliases. Therefore, Members use the email alias service at their own risk.Disclaimers of WarrantiesOUR SITE AND THE SERVICES AND MATERIALS AVAILABLE THROUGH IT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO USER CONTENT, SOCIAL NETWORKING FEATURES, AND ASME’S EMAIL ALIAS SERVICE, ARE AVAILABLE \"AS IS\" AND “AS AVAILABLE.” WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT OUR SITE OR ANY OF THE SERVICES OR MATERIALS AVAILABLE THROUGH IT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.
