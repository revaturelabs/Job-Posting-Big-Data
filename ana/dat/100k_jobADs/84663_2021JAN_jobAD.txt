These include the pre-production stage, when an artistic concept or idea is originated and developed by an Art Director or other creative professional, the planning phase, when the technical and logistical aspects of the production are defined and the budget is planned and, finally, the production or execution stage, involving the participation of performers and technical staff.In some cases, there may also be a post-production phase, in which the product is fine-tuned, edited, finessed - or in some cases even reworked - to ensure it is ready for distribution and marketing.The creation of a fashion collection is no less complex, involving a conception and design phase, the making of samples and test garments, and the production of the garment itself - not to mention the organization of fashion shows, which are events in themselves, requiring the participation of set designers and builders, models, photographers, make up artists, hair stylists and sound and video technicians.As befits a vast and varied industry, the training and education requirements to work in the arts and fashion are equally varied, including qualifications in the visual arts and fine arts, choreography, set design, dance, theatre, music, cinema, photography and fashion, to name but a few.What types of businesses operate in the Arts and Fashion industry?Arts and fashion industry professionals may be able to find work in the entertainment industry, which includes TV and radio, cinema and theatre.

As a result, fashion and textiles companies need fashion management experts who can help them plan new brand, product, communication and retail strategies that reflect the ever-evolving market environment.What skills are required in the Arts and Fashion industry?The skills required to work in the Arts and Fashion industry tend to vary from sector to sector. However, there are a number of transversal competencies required by all arts and fashion professionals.The three most important are:Creativity and tasteWhether you’re a musician, photographer or fashion designer, you won’t get far without creativity and taste. The ability to create harmonious compositions of sound, light, colour, shapes and materials is to some degree innate, but hard work and experience can serve to develop and refine it.Ability to understand and satisfy an audienceIn order to be commercially viable, all arts and fashion products need to appeal to the tastes and preferences of their target audience. A film or theatrical production that nobody goes to see, or a fashion collection nobody wants to buy have both failed to satisfy their target audience’s needs and expectations.Passion and determinationTurning your passion into a profession with a career in the arts is by no means easy. The creative industries are a sector in which it is notoriously difficult to excel and stand out from the crowd - especially because acquiring the technical skills needed to succeed require real hard work and commitment. Passion and determination are therefore essential qualities for anybody wanting to make it in the arts and fashion industry.Arts - Job DescriptionsInterested in finding out more about jobs in the Arts and Fashion industry?Take a look at the job descriptions we’ve prepared:DancerPhotographerMost Popular Arts and Fashion Jobs2D Artist3D Artist Select cityActorArt Director Select cityArt GalleryArts Select cityAudio TechnicianAudio Visual TechnicianCharacter ArtistChoreographerComposer Select cityConcept ArtistConservatorDancer Select cityDecorator Select cityDJGallery AssistantGraphic ArtistGraphic Designer Select cityHair StylistIllustrator Select cityMakeup ArtistModel Select cityModeling Select cityMuseum Select cityMusic DirectorMusicianPhotographer Select cityProduction Assistant Select cityScheduling Coordinator Select citySinger Select cityStylistTattoo ArtistJobtedJobs by categoryJobs by locationJobs by companyTermsPrivacyContacts© 2013-2021 Jobted"
