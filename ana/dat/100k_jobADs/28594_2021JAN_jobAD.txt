My promise to you is a safe and open conversation, great questions, challenges to some of the assumptions that you are making and acting upon in your everyday life, a couple of good stories, my best listening, thinking, and, finally serving up some relevant bit of wisdom for you to take away and ponder.What is your coaching philosophy?My \"coaching philosophy\" is based on a strong belief in people and their capacity to do great things. The potential that is represented by the coaching relationship is at once powerful and daunting. Approached with courage and candor, the coaching conversation can explore the possibilities, pose the \"big\" questions, consider the unknown, and generate a plan. Throughout the process the coach needs to be focused, accountable, and agile. Leadership coaching tends to focus internally and pursue answers to questions that, once answered, enable you to lead with a greater sense of self awareness and authenticity.What is your professional background?CEO for four associations and served as the interim CEO for an additional two. In 2003 my wife and I founded a professional services firm (The Ancora Group, LLC) that coaches leaders, provides support and guidance to governing bodies, teaches and develops leaders, designs and engages in succession planning and talent management, and facilitates conversations and planning initiatives that generate strategic and transformational solutions for organizations.I received my coaching credentials from the International Coaching Federation and am a graduate of Georgetown University's Leadership Coaching Program. I have been trained to use the 360 assessment tools created by the Center for Creative Leadership. My formal education includes a Bachelor's degree from the University of Maryland, an MBA from Marymount University, and an MPA from Harvard.Ready To Get Started With Robert?Order online below.
