Unfortunately, it did not contain the finer detail of how the JobKeeper Payment Scheme (‘the Scheme’) will operate.What it did was set up a framework including giving the Treasurer the power to make Rules, by way of Legislative Instrument, as to how the Scheme will work. These Rules are not currently available.ATO’s role in the JobKeeper Payment SchemeFurther, as previously announced by Treasury, the Commissioner of Taxation will be given certain discretions relating to the operation of the Scheme, including the ability to provide alternative turnover tests that can be satisfied if the tests already announced by Treasury cannot be met (e.g., that businesses with a turnover below $1 billion must have had or will have at least a 30% reduction in their turnover due to the effect of COVID-19). It is anticipated that the ATO will make this information available once Treasury has released the Rules.We believe this information is imminent and as soon as it is available, we will be working quickly to provide you with all the necessary information you will need to understand how this scheme will operate.We are here to assist you, please contact us with an concerns or questions.Client Meetingsthese are suspended for the time being, however email us to arrange a virtual meetingCall us(+61) (3) 9823 3366Email usrry@rosroy.com.au or staff member directlyRoseby Rosner & Young is a CertifiedPracticing Account	Keep UpdatedReceive the latest Tax Updates newsletter,news and event information.Copyright Roseby Rosner & Young Pty Ltd 2021 | Website by Windfall"
