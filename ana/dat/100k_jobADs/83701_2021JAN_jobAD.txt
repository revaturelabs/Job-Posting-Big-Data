You can in fact set your own cronjobs to be executed on any time frame you want. However, you need to proceed with caution and ensure that the time interval between executions is not too short. This is so because too short a time interval may increase the server load on the entire server which may result in degraded server performance and downtime.Was this answer helpful? 5 0Did We Miss Out on Something?Relax, we have you covered.
