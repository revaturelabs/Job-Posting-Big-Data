The program aims to educate advanced undergraduate students about the theory, practice, organization, and control of war and military forces. Students will learn from and interact with distinguished senior leaders in the national security and military communities. This course bridges the civil-military divide and teaches students at the start of their careers how to assess military decision-making. It is not an international relations course about why wars occur.The curriculum includes extensive and intensive reading on military theory, history, operations, and current conflicts. Studies of military history inform discussions of issues such as the introductions of new technology to warfare, whether political leaders should shape military decisions, and ethics in the conduct of war. Students participate in a battlefield staff-ride to Gettysburg to explore the relationships between terrain, timing, and decision-making in war. Alumni are eligible to participate in the War Studies Advanced Programs offered twice annually; previous topics include the American All-Volunteer Force, Civil-Military Relations in the United States, and Russian Hybrid Warfare.The Summer 2021 program will be run in-person should the public health situation allow for an in-person program in DC. If necessary, adjustments will be made by July 1 to shift the program online. In either case, ISW and Hertog promise a professional and rewarding experience for participants.All students will receive a stipend of $1,500 in addition to housing, meals, and subsidized transportation to and within Washington, DC. This is a full-time commitment.Applications should be submitted via https://hertogfoundation.org/programs/war-studies.Deadlines & InterviewsApplications for 2021 will be accepted on a rolling basis and review will begin January 6, 2021.
