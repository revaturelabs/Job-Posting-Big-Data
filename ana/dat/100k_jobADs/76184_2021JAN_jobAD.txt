[INSIGHT]Martin Lewis breaks down Universal Credit rules [EXPERT]Debt warning: Government urged to change as families struggle [WARNING]There are also slightly different rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland where differing lockdown rules are in affect.To be eligible for Universal Credit, a claimant will need to be on a low income or out of work entirely.Additionally, they must be aged between 18 and state pension age, have less than £16,000 in savings and be living in the UK.If a person is in a partnership when applying, their partner’s income and savings will be taken into account.What a person receives from Universal Credit will depend on the claimant’s specific circumstances.Standard allowances are in place which everyone will receive as a minimum and additional payments will be provided for certain elements such as having children and rental costs.The standard allowances will be based on the claimant’s age and relationship status and they’ll range between £342.72 and £594.04 per month.Currently, all claimants are receiving a £20 uplift to their payments and the DWP has confirmed they’ll be reviewing this boost in early 2021.Payments will usually arrive once a month into a bank, building society or credit union account.Initial payments can take around five weeks to arrive but claimants can apply for an advance if they’re struggling with bills.After the first payment, claimants will be paid on the same date of every month.If these payment dates fall on a weekend or bank holiday, claimants will usually see the money arrive early on the first working day before this.Source: Read Full ArticlePost navigation« OPEC Faces Seismic Demand Split as Cartel Plots Next MoveCarer’s allowance claims may boost other benefit payments – full details on claiming rules »Business NewsUnivision Sets PrendeTV; Free, Ad-Supported Streaming Service For U.S. Hispanic Audience To Launch This QuarterParler Site Officially Goes Dark, CEO Cries “Double Standard” With Antitrust BentCosabella makes the only bralette I've tried that suits my petite, large-chested frame — here's why it's worth $66Recent PostsJapan Still Has Mountain to Climb Before It Can Lift EmergencySchumer: Pelosi will deliver Trump impeachment article to Senate on MondayTop Analyst Has 4 Red-Hot Semiconductor Capital Equipment Stocks to Buy Now for 2021Gab, a social networking site popular among the far right, seems to be capitalizing on Twitter bans and Parler's suspension from the Google store.
