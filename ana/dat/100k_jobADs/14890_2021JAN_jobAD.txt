The number of claims was higher than economists forecasted. The U.S. has experienced about 20 weeks of overclaims hovering around 1 million Americans filing for unemployment. Roughly 57.4 million Americans have filed for unemployment since mid-March.Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust, a high-end private bank and money manager founded in 1889, succinctly summed up last week’s unemployment numbers stating, “This is not a sign of a healthy labor market.”The report is disappointing and disturbing. It's indicative of the struggle we’re enduring. It shouldn't, however, surprise the economists. States are still under lockdown and sectors, such as hospitality, travel, leisure, restaurants, events and airlines, are reeling from the effects of the pandemic. Daniel Zhao, senior economist at job aggregator and company-ratings site Glassdoor, said about the increase in claims compared to the prior week, “The modest jump is a stark reminder that claims will likely encounter some turbulence, as they fall rather than gliding in for a soft landing.”A “soft landing” is optimistic. The weekly unemployment numbers came out after the Paycheck Protection Program ended. The PPP was part of the multitrillion government stimulus plan that provided companies with forgivable loans under the condition that they’d retain their employees for a specified period ending Sept. 30. Thousands of businesses that are dealing with life-threatening financial problems, due to the disruption wrought by Covid-19, will most likely not hire new people. It's reasonable to believe, if market conditions do not improve, there will be an avalanche of downsizings when the PPP restriction stops and companies start letting go of workers to cut costs and save money.MORE FOR YOUBiden Is Expected To Enact Emergency Executive Orders To Aid Struggling AmericansWho Is Amanda Gorman: Youth Poet Wows With Words In Presidential PerformanceThe Top 100 Companies For Remote Jobs In 2021On the somewhat bright side, to put the current unemployment numbers into perspective, about 7 million people filed claims in March. On a positive note, companies added roughly 9.3 million jobs over the past three months.It's hard to comprehend that back in January, the U.S. was encountering record-high employment and the lowest unemployment numbers in a half-century. Although there has been hiring, we’re still at around 10.2% unemployment, as of the end of July. “Claims remain exceptionally high, even as businesses are reopening, and are indicative of extremely weak labor market conditions,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in an interview with CNBC said, “There’s no question that the economic numbers are doing better. So, as we reopen the economy, we see things are getting better.” Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and hedge fund manager added, “But the president wants us to do more. He wants us to provide money for kids and jobs, and a second round of the PPP and direct payments are a clear part of that.”With the termination of an enhanced $600-per-week unemployment check, in addition to what the state pays, many people may find themselves in dire financial straits. For example, unemployed people in Mississippi and Arizona only receive $240 weekly. President Donald Trump, through an executive edict, offered an extra $300. So far, not many states have participated in his plan.Unemployment was never meant to replace a person’s income, but in this unprecedented time, people are in more need than ever. To compound the problem, Congress has yet to come to an agreement on adding to the unemployment benefits or put together another round of stimulus to help Americans get through this challenging time.It's imperative that—even though we're in the midst of an acrimonious battle for the U.S. presidency—our elected officials put aside their differences and focus on formulating a comprehensive plan to turn things around and actually help their constituencies—the American people.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
