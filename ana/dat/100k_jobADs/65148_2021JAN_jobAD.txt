We should have needed more budgetary support but more investments from the private sector will help us unlock the potential of the sector,” Dar said in a media interview.While the threat of Covid-19 remains, he said he believes that the resiliency and persistence of the farming and fishing sectors would manifest this year.“That’s why we like to believe that 2021, while Covid (coronavirus disease 2019) is still there, because of the resiliency of the Philippine farming and fishing sectors, they will continue to do farming, fishing, agribusiness. We have put in place for this year one DA holistic approach, all the strategies we would like to do next year will be under this integrated or holistic approach,” Dar said.He noted that the DA aims to achieve a higher food sufficiency level in 2021 by continuing its programs, such as the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund, loan programs, and farm-to-market assistance.Under the P4.5 trillion General Appropriations Act for 2021 signed by Duterte last month, the DA received an allocation of P71 billion.
