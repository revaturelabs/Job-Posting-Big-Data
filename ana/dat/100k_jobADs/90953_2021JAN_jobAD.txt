Would RecommendApr 22014Great Job! Would RecommendCategories:Great Job! Would RecommendApril 2, 2014Both my wife and I run our own businesses. Our focus is on our family and work and not until we had West Coast Maids in to help clean our house, we didn’t realize how much we didn’t make cleaning our house a priority. West Coast Maids did such a great job, we have since had them back on a weekly basis to help with our house work. They are fantastic! We would recommend them to anyone that has a busy life or just needs some extra help.Brian & Annabelle T.Maple Ridge, BCWe Use Environmentally SafeGreen Works Cleaning ProductsLearn MoreGive The Gift Of A Clean Home Today!Gift Certificates AvailableLearn MoreConvenientSchedulingPost-CLeanWalk ThroughUp FrontPricingSatisfactionGuaranteeOur ServicesOur Cleaning ServicesMaid & House Cleaning ServiceSpring CleaningMoving & Estate CleaningOrganizing & De-ClutteringHeavy Duty CleaningAdditional ServicesOur Cleaning ChecklistCompany InformationAbout West Coast MaidsSatisfaction GuaranteeCustomer TestimonialsPromotions & PackagesFrequently Asked QuestionsOur BlogContact UsVancouverWest VancouverNorth VancouverDowntown VancouverBurnabyCoquitlamPort CoquitlamPort MoodyPitt MeadowsMaple RidgeAreas We ServiceMaple RidgeMissionRichmondDeltaNew WestminsterSurreyLangleyAbbotsfordChilliwackAldergroveCloverdaleBarrieSimcoe CountyOrilliaWasaga BeachAngusUtopiaEssaStroudBorenMinesingThortonInnisfillMidhurstCrown HillSunnidaleCopyright © 2021 West Coast Maids.
