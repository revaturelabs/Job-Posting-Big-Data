That is the highest reading in five months and an increase of 181,000 over the previous week.Initial jobless claims are a proxy for layoffs, and last week’s numbers were worse than many economists had expected.“While prospects for the economy later in 2021 are upbeat, the labor market recovery has taken a step backward and we expect claims to remain elevated with the risk that they rise from last week’s levels,” Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.Continuing claims, which measures the total number of laid-off workers collecting state unemployment benefits, rose for the first time since November to 5.27 million in the week ending January 2 – an increase of 199,000 over the previous week’s reading.The US labour market recovery started to stall in the final quarter of 2020. In December, the economy shed 140,000 jobs, slamming the brakes on seven consecutive months of jobs gains.Other economic indicators have also been flashing red as the US continues to break records for COVID-19 infections.Consumer spending – which drives roughly two-thirds of US economic growth – fell in November.The number of people collecting benefits from both state and federal programmes fell by 744,511 to 18.4 million in the week ending December 26.Economists attribute that fall to the lapsing of federal benefits before a new virus relief aid bill was signed on December 27. Now that federal jobless benefits have been renewed, those claims could rise again.The raft of new coronavirus relief measures passed in December includes a $300 weekly federal top-up to state unemployment benefits and provisions allowing laid-off workers who qualify to claim up to 24 weeks of federal unemployment benefits after they’ve exhausted state aid.And more government largesse is expected now that the Democrats have cemented control over both houses of Congress, making it easier for President-elect Joe Biden to enact key parts of his economic agenda.Biden has said that December’s stimulus deal would not be the final one and that more generous benefits would be forthcoming to help the nation weather the pandemic.The president-elect is set to unveil a new $1.5 trillion stimulus plan on Thursday..Source linkShare this:TweetTelegramWhatsAppMorePrintLike this:Like Loading...US confirms first case of Brazil COVID-19 variantOpinion | Something Special Just Happened in RussiaNetherlands rocked by third night of rioting over COVID curfewBrazil’s top court OKs probe into handling of COVID-19 in ManausFour falsehoods Giuliani spread about Dominion.US House delivers Trump impeachment article to SenateBiden Sets in Motion Plan to Ban New Oil and Gas Drilling on Federal LandAs Virus Grows Stealthier, Vaccine Makers Reconsider Battle PlansUS allows transactions with Houthis as ‘terrorist’ label reviewedUS police have killed 135 unarmed Black people since 2015: NPRHow Options Trading Could Be Fueling a Stock Market BubbleCanada protesters renew push to end arms exports to Saudi ArabiaCentral African Republic gov’t says forces killed 44 rebelsGameStop’s volatile rally smashes Wall St price targets11th hour: Trump admin eased sanctions on mining magnate GertlerFauci on What Working for Trump Was Really LikeItalian PM Conte to resign on Tuesday ‘to seek new mandate’Italy’s Prime Minister to Quit, Adding Political Chaos To PandemicCan Turkey and Greece resolve their maritime dispute?Biden reverses Trump’s ban on transgender people in US militaryPage1 Page2 Page3 Page4 Page5CategoriesArticlesBlogsDaily OffersEnglish NewsMobile ReviewsWorld NewsPopular StoriesLarry King, Breezy Interviewer of the Famous and Infamous, Dies at 87Trump impeachment article to be sent to Senate, triggering trialTo Promote Vaccines, New Orleans Dances With Its Heart on Its SleeveUgandan court orders police to lift Bobi Wine’s house arrestSuspected extremists kill three Mali soldiersIndian, Chinese troops in new border brawlIndia, China troops in new clash along contested border: ReportsUN labour arm ILO warns of ‘lost lockdown generation’Bulgarian Dream: German pensioners retiring abroadSouth Africa issues arrest warrant for fugitive Malawi ‘prophet’ #duzline #duzlinenews #follow4followFollow Us OnFacebookTwitterInstagramYoutubeHomeWishlistAbout usPrivacy PolicyDisclosureContact UsMenuHomeWishlistAbout usPrivacy PolicyDisclosureContact Us%d bloggers like this:"
