"Learning to DO: \"It's not my job.\"Sunday, November 3, 2019\"It's not my job.\"First, I hate when people say, \"it's not my job\". It's a failure of the organization to take ownership.I've gotten to that point because at my former company design engineers doubled as responsible engineers (a new concept for me), and we would get blamed for a lot of problems. I had a boss that once said about the production line that had thrown up a lot of problems that day, \"their job is to build things, we can't take the work out of work.\"So I've come to the idea that if it is not your job, it must be mine.That's one of the fun things for me about being at a startup, especially as we work on these one off facility projects instead of the higher volume products, we don't have a clearly defined structure for who will kit the facility assemblies, so it must be me, I mean, I did design it.Posted by Isaiah at 10:03 AMHelpful/informative?Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels: business, start-upNo comments:Post a CommentNote: Only a member of this blog may post a comment.Newer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)My MicroblogTweets by @IsaiahJanzenSeven Most Popular Posts This WeekThe Jacobian: Finite Element Mesh QualityAnsys: The Pinball RegionAbaqus: How to Reduce the Size of your .stt fileAbaqus: Create AnimationsBook Review: Kiss or Kill by Mark TwightAbaqus: Bottom-up mesh exampleAbaqus: Selecting Inside SurfacesLabelsabaqus ansys art Athletic Republic bicycling book bottom-up Broad Peak business buying and selling a stock carabiner climb coaching colorado company competition documentary ebook economics week Election 2012 energy engineering finite element I live in Iowa ice axe innovation investing It's Not Rocket Science janzen gear learning life life of a contract engineer marathon marketing mesh money mountaineering olympics pakistan parents product race relationships rope soloing running science space squidoo start-up strage innovation awards successful innovative companies sustanability team tip of the day tip of the week unemployment unemployment chronicles value workout WPI writingSearch This BlogBlog Archive► 2020 (39)► November (3)► October (1)► August (1)► July (2)► June (3)► May (5)► April (9)► March (10)► February (4)► January (1)▼ 2019 (44)▼ November (3)Injured... again.
