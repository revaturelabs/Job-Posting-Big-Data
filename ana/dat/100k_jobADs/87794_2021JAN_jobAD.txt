When we find people displaced from their homes, countries, or lives, our instinct may be to focus only on their basic needs. And that is essential. But it’s also not a life. A life is filled with joy, dignity, connection, and purpose. And that’s what we aim to build.Now, we're taking the next big step on a journey to unleash and put into action that same abundant belief. This year, American Refugee Committee will become Alight. We’re the same organization with the same people doing the same critical work – providing health care and clean water, shelter, protection, and economic opportunity to more than 3.5 million people in 17 countries each year. But in solidarity with the people we serve who are too often defined by a single dark moment in their lives, we’re dropping the label ‘refugee.’https://wearealight.org/Vacancy No: 8495Grade Level: 5 (Officer Level)Supervisor: Project ManagerNo. of Post: 1Duty Station: GedarefDuration: Full-time (fixed term 8-month contract)Closing Date: 18 Jan 2021Background:COUNTRY PROGRAM MISSION:ALIGHT (previously known as the American Refugee Committee -ARC) Sudan Program started in 2004 in response to the emergency needs of some 600,000 war-affected IDPs and host populations in the Tulus and Gereida corridors in South Darfur.
