For each of our sponsors we wrote down a short company description, an update on the current situation regarding COVID-19 and obtaining an internship place, and contact details of the people responsible. When new information is available we will update this page.Witteveen+Bos‘The geotechnical engineers of Witteveen+Bos do all kinds of work tasks. They work on big and complex infrastructure and hydraulic projects. Some examples of these projects are the North-Southline in Amsterdam, the Oosterweel connection in Antwerp and the renovation of the Afsluitdijk. It depends on the project what kind of role they partake in (client/ contractor). Most of the time they do the design tasks (making calculations and giving advise on tunnel cross sections, cofferdams, foundations, geotechnical structures), but they also give support during construction and they check designs of other companies. They work a lot in multidisciplinary project teams, together with the government, contractors and engineering companies.’It is still possible to do an internship or graduate at Witteveen+Bos. Because of corona it is a bit more difficult to get to know the company and get the desired supervision, but they try their best to still make it happen. The offices are opened, but limited.
