You do not need to outline every duty but you should add sufficient detail to entice applications, including approximate pay information. Being too vague will make applicants think you have something to hide. Using search engine keywords in the text will make your advert easier for the appropriate candidates to find.Specify if the position or department is new to encourage applicants interested in building success. Give details of your expectations and any potential challenges to attract high achieving candidates and weed out those who will find the role too hard. If you require candidates to think outside the box or to demonstrate particular qualities, highlight this in your advert and use both a style and language that makes this evident. Talk up selling points such as a great benefits package, training opportunities or a fun work culture.Clearly defining the role and your expectations of candidates will attract suitable applicants who will add value to your firm whilst simultaneously discouraging time-wasters.Arrange your free idibu demo now...Previous Story← The Future of Recruiting and Hiring Technology – will Recruiting and Hiring Ever Not Need Humans?Next StoryHow Technology Transformed the Recruitment Industry →Subscribe by EmailNo Comments YetLet us know what you thinkCall sales onUK/Europe: +44 (0)800 311 2750APAC: +61 (0)3 9018 5525UK office:1st Floor, The Bloc,Ashley Road, AltrinchamWA14 2DWU.K.European office:Calle Sardenya 259 3°3°Barcelona08013SpainAPAC office:Floor 1A, Trendy Building,Sukhumvit Soi 13,Klongtoey-Nua, Wattana,Bangkok 10110Useful links:Candidate attractionCandidate managementAnalyticsApplication pagesMobile appCRM integrationsCase studiesCompany blogidibu & GDPRArrange your free demoCopyright © 2020 idibu.
