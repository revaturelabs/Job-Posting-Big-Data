The amendment was also sponsored by Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy (FL-07), Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (HI-02) and Congressman Brian Mast (FL-18).The House late Thursday evening unanimously adopted the amendment to H.R. 5895, the defense “minibus” spending bill, which will expand the U.S. House of Representatives Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program. The program provides wounded post-9/11 veterans the opportunity to serve in a two-year paid fellowship within the House of Representatives.\"By investing in the Wounded Warrior Fellowship program, we can expand job opportunities for veterans, increase the number of veterans in public service and bring the unique perspective of veterans to more congressional offices,” said Congressman Kildee. “I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to help veterans transition from their service to new careers back home.”“Our veterans, especially those wounded in the line of duty, have fought hard to protect our nation, and Congress should fight just as hard for them,” said Congresswoman Murphy. “The Wounded Warrior fellowship program helps veterans succeed after they leave the military by affording them potentially life-changing personal and professional opportunities to gain experience in congressional offices. Veterans can use the valuable skills they honed in the military to help constituents, including fellow veterans, in congressional districts across the country. I’m proud to work with Congressman Kildee to create more opportunities for disabled veterans to get the skills, training, and expertise that will help them succeed.”Congressman Kildee's amendment, which has the support of Republicans and Democrats, expands the existing Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program. Currently, there is a waiting list of over 100 congressional offices looking to hire a wounded warrior fellow, but cannot due to the lack of funding. Congressman Kildee’s amendment expands the Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program so that additional opportunities are available for veterans to serve in Congress. In 2017, Congressman Kildee successfully passed an amendment to expand the program by $250,000.Congressman Kildee's remarks on the House floor regarding his amendment can be viewed here.###Issues:VeteransNewsroomPress ReleasesIn the NewsSocial MediaWashington, DC Office200 Cannon House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515Phone: 202-225-3611Fax: 202-225-6393Flint Office601 South Saginaw St., Suite 403Flint, MI 48502Phone: 810-238-8627Fax: 810-238-8658CopyrightPrivacy"
