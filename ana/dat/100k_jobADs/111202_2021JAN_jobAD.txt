For each health category, the metrics assigned to the category have been individually scored out of 100 for the master list, and a final index for that category out of 100 created from an average of these metrics.From there, the selected jobs have been ranked according to their position in that master list, and their score for that category reflects their scoring in the master list, rather than in comparison with the shorter selected list.The scores shown refer to a total score out of 100, where the lower the score, the safer the position is from that health risk.For Overall Health, the Safety Scores of all individual categories were combined into a single average and used to rank the jobs.Category ANever0Once a year or more but not every month25Once a month or more but not every week50Once a week or more but not every day100Every day100Cramped Work Space, Awkward PositionsExposed to ContaminantsExposed to Disease or InfectionsExposed to Hazardous ConditionsExposed to Hazardous EquipmentExposed to High PlacesExposed to Minor Burns, Cuts, Bites, or StingsExposed to RadiationExposed to Whole Body VibrationExtremely Bright or Inadequate LightingIn an Enclosed Vehicle or EquipmentIn an Open Vehicle or EquipmentIndoors, Environmentally ControlledIndoors, Not Environmentally ControlledOutdoors, Exposed to WeatherOutdoors, Under CoverVery Hot or Cold TemperaturesWear Common Protective or Safety Equipment such as Safety Shoes, Glasses, Gloves, Hearing Protection, Hard Hats, or Life JacketsWear Specialized Protective or Safety Equipment such as Breathing Apparatus, Safety Harness, Full Protection Suits, or Radiation ProtectionSounds, Noise Levels Are Distracting or UncomfortableCategory BNever0Less than half the time25About half the time50More than half the time100Continually or almost continually100Spend Time Bending or Twisting the BodySpend Time Climbing Ladders, Scaffolds, or PolesSpend Time Keeping or Regaining BalanceSpend Time Kneeling, Crouching, Stooping, or CrawlingSpend Time Making Repetitive MotionsSpend Time SittingSpend Time StandingSpend Time Using Your Hands to Handle, Control, or Feel Objects, Tools, or ControlsSpend Time Walking and RunningCategory CI don't work near other people (beyond 100 ft.)0I work with others but not closely (e.g. private office)25Slightly close (e.g. shared office)50Moderately close (at arm's length)100Very close (near touching)100Physical ProximitySourcesec.europa.eumichaelpage.co.uknationalcareers.service.gov.ukonetonline.orgpayscale.comprospects.ac.ukLove it?
