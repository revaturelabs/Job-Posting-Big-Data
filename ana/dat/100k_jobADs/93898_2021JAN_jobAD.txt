"An arrest on your record could cost you a job. This free legal clinic will help you clean it upA Clean Slate: Montgomery Volunteer Lawyers Program expungement clinicThursday, Nov. 7 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.Flatline Church at Chisolm 2938 Lower Wetumpka Road, Montgomery 36110Anyone who’s been involved with the justice system knows that second chances don’t always come easy when it comes to the law. A new legal clinic hopes to change that.The Montgomery Volunteer Lawyers Program will launch its first expungement clinic at Flatline Church in the Chisolm neighborhood this Thursday to help those with nonviolent arrest cases that never yielded convictions wipe their records clean.That means any Alabama resident who was arrested for a nonviolent crime like driving under the influence or drug possession, and unpaid traffic tickets can petition the court to expunge their records.When arrests don’t end in conviction, people often assume that their records remain unblemished. But, MVLP Executive Director Laurel Crawford said that isn’t the case. Without triggering the legal process of expungement that information is still public.“Even though the case is dismissed, the arrest itself is not expunged,” Crawford said. “So, when it comes up on a background check some employers won’t hire you. Even if there was no conviction.”It’s an issue that persists across industries, but frequently impacts fields like health care and transportation where workers responsibilities directly impact public safety.In one MVLP case, a 40-year-old single mother of three who had put herself through school and earned a Certified Nursing Assistant certificate, was denied a job because of a nonviolent offense she committed at age 19. Even though a grand jury had declined to pursue charges, the stigma of her arrest was still tacked to her record.“The other thing that people don’t realize is there are certain government benefits that you can’t get if you have certain arrests on your record. For instance, when applying for student loans, or TANF benefits or SNAP benefits,” Crawford said.“When you have that following you around it’s not just hurtful to you, it’s now affecting your family.”There are a variety of reasons an arrest could be dismissed without conviction.A case could be nolle prossed, where the district attorney has decided not to prosecute; or dismissed with or without prejudice because laws changed, or another person was found to be the perpetrator of a crime. A grand jury may even no-bill a case, meaning that they found no probable cause to issue formal charges.If a person has enrolled in a diversion program — like drug, veterans or mental health court — this could also result in a non-conviction that would be eligible for expungement, though only one year after completion.Those who have finished diversion programs less than a year ago are still encouraged to attend the clinic where they can get an overview of the process and a head start on the paperwork.On Thursday, applicants must bring a government ID, a list of cases they’re involved in or any paperwork related to their arrest that may have a case number. Volunteers will then assess whether a person’s arrest is eligible for expungement and help them complete the application, which is subject to a $300 filing fee.That's a lot of money when you’re living paycheck to paycheck, as many of MVLP's clients do. But it's a slight figure in comparison to the costs of hiring a lawyer.“The going rate for expungements in this county is about $5,000. … The reason that our clients have not applied for this before now is because they can’t afford an attorney,” Crawford said.Alabama currently does not offer expungement fee waivers, but applicants can apply for an affidavit of hardship that allows them to stagger the sum with a payment plan.Once the affidavit has been completed, applicants will be given a checklist that details each document they will need to bring to the clerk’s office to file, where they can get them, and when they will need to submit their application.The results aren’t immediate; it usually takes about 30 days for the FBI and Alabama Bureau of Investigations to update their systems. So, Crawford encourages job seekers to be honest with employers if they’re fearful their records might not yet be in the clear.One caveat to the expungement process is that private companies, which many companies hire to complete background checks, are not under government control. So, although they are legally required to update their records within 30 to 60 days of expungement, that doesn’t always happen.Still, the legal clinic offers those who need it an opportunity to be judged beyond the boundaries of their greatest mistakes.Contact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Safiya Charles at (334) 306-5704 or SCharles@montgome.gannett.comView CommentsAbout Us Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2021 www.montgomeryadvertiser.com.
