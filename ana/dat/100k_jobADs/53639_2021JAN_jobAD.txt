I was told that the results have been compiled and have been forwarded to the concerned mini ratna psu, the name for which they refused to divulge. I was also told that AIMA's job is done with the handing over of the results to their 'client'.Now the thing is that the name of this client has not been disclosed. So we cannot contact anyone else but AIMA. They are not updating their webiste either. All this leads me to believe that we have been fooled and it was indeed a fake recruitment. Which is terribly sad if true. In today's transparent world, it would be audacious, to say the least, that such a fake recruitment drive at such a massive scale would be allowed to go unnoticed.ReplyDeleteRepliesAnonymous 26/3/13 1:28 PMDear Anonymous.The psu is real You don't have to worry for the results because there might be some important reason for the delay.
