One of Obama’s first actions in office was an enormous stimulus package called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. According to the Washington Examiner, Obama’s economic advisors Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein, estimated that the stimulus package would steer unemployment away from levels above 8 percent, leading it to about 6 percent today. The stimulus was meant to alleviate the unemployment levels during the recession by creating and protecting jobs, according to recovery.gov. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment in 2009 was 9.3 percent. It increased to 9.6 in 2010. The amount of the stimulus was increased from the original $787 billion. The level crawled down to 8.9 percent in 2011. Currently, unemployment stands at 7.8 percent. Although the unemployment rate decreased from the original percentage, the amount of spending outpaced the benefit by a significant amount. Obama’s advisors, representing his own administration, failed to keep the promise of lowering the unemployment rate significantly.While job growth is unsuccessful in Obama’s presidency, the motivation to work became a bigger issue than ever. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although more jobs were created, labor force participation declined by about two percent since Obama was inaugurated. A decrease by two percent may not seem like a lot, but when the American population is about 313 million, according to usnews.com, more than 62 million of those people have stopped working. In addition is the portion of adults in that population who still could not find work from the nadir of the recession and may have lost hope. Other slumps in the economy persist: increasing food, health care and energy prices, decreasing house values, and more.The economy barely budges even with massive spending. In fact, the accumulating debt only makes the United States move backward. Not only is our country in debt to countries like China, but competition as well. Expert entrepreneur tactics, not partisan politics, only seem necessary to ensure that America’s economy remains strong. Romney was a successful businessman, co-founding Bain Capital, which helped over 100 businesses, according to his website.Of course, Romney understands that heading towards maximum employment is the first step for America. He also knows that there are more complex ways than Obama’s method of government spending to create jobs. To prove his dedication to the topic, Romney and his advisors mapped out an 87-page plan called “Believe in America” just for job growth. To sum up his aspirations in the publication is Romney’s five point plan. First is energy independence in the United States by 2020. Second is promoting fair trade practices, especially in China, and opening markets to more American products. Third is improving access to and quality of education and job training. Fourth is to control the size of the government and national debt and shrinking the deficit. Fifth is focusing on accomplishments of small business by less regulation and taxes. The plan, as a whole, strives to improve the quality and quantity of American workers while making the United States a business-friendly market.Many of his critics charge that he is not clear with his plan for strengthening the economy. But for those who will search deep for the facts, they are right on his campaign website. Romney also gave many ideas about his propositions in the first debate. He has demonstrated that he has more experience and innovative ideas than Obama to create jobs for America.By Emily LeaymanShare this:FacebookTwitterPinterestEmailPrintLike this:Like Loading...Categories: Freeform	Post navigationLiberal vs. Conservative: Unemploment/Job Growth (Liberal)Parents outliving ChildrenSearch for...Like The Keystone on Facebook!Like The Keystone on Facebook!Follow us on TwitterMy TweetsArchivesArchives Select Month January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 July 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 December 2010 March 2010Creative Commons LicenseThis site protected by Creative Commons (CC) license “Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives” (CC BY-NC-ND)Top categories: Uncategorized KutztownCreate a website or blog at WordPress.com |Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address CancelPost was not sent - check your email addresses!
