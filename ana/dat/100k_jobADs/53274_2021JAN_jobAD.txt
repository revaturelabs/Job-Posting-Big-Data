I cannot judge what was happening in Chelsea, but I was very surprised.”Asked if it means that no manager is safe, he replied: “It’s like that bit we know that in advance. It’s this world. I have the full confidence of my board and my players, I feel, and it’s like that.“But we have to get results, we have to win, we know that – the players know it, I know it, and my staff know it. We have to win because when you lose too much it’s the end of the world for me also.”Marching orders: Mourinho was dismissed by Abramovich on ThursdayVan Gaal acknowledged that United fans are unhappy but once again insisted that the mood in the camp was good, despite reports to the contrary.“Yes it’s fine,” he added. “But I’ve said already more than once. I have seen articles that it’s not like that. It’s a bit crazy I think, but that is this world.“It’s always like that when you lose, fans have to prove their belief again. When you lose that is less at that moment.“The board of directors can see what you can do as a manager in practice but the fans cannot see that, so when you lose you need the belief of the fans, and that is a question of the fans not the manager to answer.”TAGSArsenalChelseaJose MourinhoLiverpoolLouis Van GaalManchetser UnitedShareFacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsAppPrevious articleGuus Hiddink arrives in London to take over as Chelsea managerNext articleArsenal given major boost ahead of Manchester City clashWayne VeyseyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORExclusives‘Not that Ashley gives a ****’ – Exclusive: Finance Guru shares intriguing Newcastle sack viewExclusives‘Amazing’ – Exclusive: Finance Guru ranks Leeds 4th in the World in transfer revealAston Villa NewsPundit Exclusive: Aston Villa close to signing player they can make big profit onFootball News 24/7PopularBournemouth NewsSources: Tottenham accept 7-figure bid for internationalWayne Veysey - 15th September 20200Tottenham have accepted a bid from Bournemouth for Cameron Carter-Vickers and he has been given the green light to discuss personal terms, Football Insider...‘Massive blow’ – Exclusive: Whelan drops big Morelos claim after Rangers...21st September 2020Pundit Exclusive: Ancelotti told to U-turn over Everton star savaged by...3rd October 2020‘Huge blow for Tottenham’ – Exclusive: McAvennie reacts to big Mourinho...1st October 2020Exclusive: Leeds United table new bid for Brighton centre-back18th September 2020ABOUT US© 2021 Breaking Media Limited.
