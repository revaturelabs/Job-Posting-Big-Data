People who think they should only have to do what’s on their job description aren’t utility players, and your organization is likely too lean to afford employees who only want to perform in a narrow box.“That’s not my job” can also be an outcome of leaders and managers who can’t let go and let employees take risks and make decisions. If that’s your management style, hire people who will follow directions and don’t want to create new things and solve problems. Problem solvers will be frustrated if they only get to follow instructions.Here are six steps to steer clear of “that’s not my job” syndrome and advance your career, regardless of your current role in your organization:Never say the words “that’s above or below my paygrade” or “that’s not my job.” Even if it’s true.If you don’t have the latitude to solve certain problems, ask the people you work for how they want you to handle those types of issues when you see or hear about them. That’s a subtle way to provide feedback that you don’t have the latitude you need to solve certain problems.When you see an impending train wreck, say something. I see lots of very capable employees see the train wreck coming, comment to themselves or others who can’t do anything about the problem (aka gossip), and then nod knowingly when the *&#@ hits the fan. Don’t be that person. Look out for your organization and the people you work with.If you see a broken or lacking process, raise the issue with someone who can do something about it, and offer to take a stab at fixing the problem. One of managers’ biggest complaints is employees who dump and run – “I’ve identified a problem. I’m leaving it for you to fix.”Go out of your way to do the right thing, even if you are uncomfortable or don’t want to. If it’s easier to email someone, but you know the right thing to do is to pick up the phone, pick up the phone. If an internal or external customer expresses concern and you can’t solve the problem, find someone who can. There are lots of ways to make an impact.Ask more questions. Find a non-judgmental way to ask, “Why do we do this this way?” “Have we considered…?” “Would you be open to trying…?” Status quo can be the right thing and what’s necessary. It can also be the death of organizations.Make stuff happen. Don’t pass the buck. And if you are going to pass the buck, don’t announce it. It only makes you look disempowered and uncommitted.About Shari HarleyShari Harley is the founder and President of Candid Culture, a Denver-based training firm that is bringing candor back to the workplace, making it easier to give feedback at work.

Many times Shari’s topic evokes from me a “Yes! That’s right! Amen!” Sometimes, like this week’s blog it is, “Ouch. I’m afraid I’ve done that from time to time.” My version is not the 5 words above, but is “I don’t get to make that decision”, or “No on has ever asked my opinion on this” but in a sarcastic way that has the same effect. I’m going to be more conscious and cautious!Replydoniven sprirt demmert says:	November 29, 2018 at 11:24 am	thanks for this websiteReplyLeave a ReplyClick here to cancel reply.NameEmail (will not be published)WebsiteCommentSign UpCareer tipsyou won't getelsewhere.
