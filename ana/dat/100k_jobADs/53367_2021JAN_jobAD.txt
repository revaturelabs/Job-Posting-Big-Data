What Are The Essential Elements Of The Hydroelectric Power Plant?Answer :Some of the important factors of hydroelectric energy plant are:Catchment vicinityReservoirDamSpillwaysConductsSurge tanksDraft TubesPower HouseSwitchyard for transmission of energyQuestion 2. What Is The Significance Of Dam?Answer :Dam plays the subsequent fundamental functions.It develops a reservoir of the preferred ability to store water.It builds up the pinnacle for power generation.Electrical and Electronics Engineering Interview QuestionsQuestion three. What Are Hydrograph And Its Significance?Answer :Hydrograph is a graphical representation between the release or float with time. It is plotted with flow as ordinates (Y-axis) and time periods as abscissas ( X-axis). The ordinates can be plotted in terms of the gauge peak, the range of cubic meters per second in line with square kilometer, the energy in kW that can be developed. The abscissas may be taken in phrases of hours, days, weeks or months. It also indicates the power available from the circulate at exclusive times of the day or 12 months (particular length). Hydrograph is similar to load curve and used to look at the electric strength.A Hydrograph gives the following data:The discharge at any time during the period below attention.The most and minimal runoff throughout the duration.The common run-off throughout the period.Total extent of the release up to any time, given by way of the area under the curve as much as that point.Question four. What Is The Use Of Spillway?Answer :When the water stage inside the reservoir basin rises, the stableness of the dam shape is endangered. To relieve the reservoir of this excess water, a structure is provided in the frame of the dam. This structure is referred to as spillway. This is built to behave as protection fee. This offers structural balance of the dam below situations of the floods with out elevating the reservoir level above High Flood Level.Power Electronics TutorialQuestion five. What Is Mass Curve?Answer :Mass curve suggests the overall extent of run-off in m3 up to sure time. The abscissa may be day, month or year. This curve is received from the records of average month-to-month flow. The slope of curve at any point offers the charge of glide at that point. These curves are used to decide the capacity of the garage reservoirs for hydro tasks.Power Electronics Interview QuestionsQuestion 6. What Is Called Hydro Electric Power Station?Answer :The power station, wherein the kinetic electricity of water is transformed into electrical electricity, is known as hydro-electric powered electricity station.Question 7. What Is The Source Of Generation In The Hydroelectric Power Station?Answer :Water.Power Plant Project Interview QuestionsQuestion 8. What Are The Different Sections Of A Hydroelectric Power Station?Answer :The distinctive sections of a hydroelectric power station are dams, spillways, gates, penstock & hydroelectric generators.Question nine. What Is The Function Of The Dam In A Hydroelectric Power Station?Answer :The function of dam is to create required water head and store water in catchment vicinity.Thermal Power Plant Interview QuestionsQuestion 10. Where Is Water Stored?Answer :Water is stored within the reservoir of the catchment location.Question eleven. What Are The Factors To Be Considered In Selecting The Site Of A Hydroelectric Power Plant?Answer :The following factors are to be taken into consideration for choosing the web page of a hydro-electric powered power plant:-Since potential power of water fall or kinetic energy of flowing movement is applied within the hydro-electric electricity plant, consequently water ought to be available in sufficient quantity at a good head or huge amount of water is flowing across a given point.The web page need to be convenient for the introduction of the dam and need to have topographical suitability for the erection of reservoir.The rivers feeding the reservoir need to have a massive catchment area. So that water degree in the reservoir won't fall under the minimum required inside the dry season.The land have to be rocky to be able to withstand the heavy weight of massive building of the dam.The web site ought to be reachable and habitable.There must be the possibility of movement diversion at some point of the development period.The task ought to no longer motive the serious ecological trouble.Control Systems-Electrical Engineering Interview QuestionsQuestion 12. What Are The Merits & Demerits Of The Hydro-electric Power Station?Answer :Merits:The format, production, and operation of the plant are easy.Maintenance fee is low.It can be started out and placed into provider instantly.It can take varying load without difficulty.It has no standby losses.No fuel fees are required.Less number of operational staff is needed.The performance is quite excessive approximately 75% to 85%.Demerits:Large region is needed.It takes a long time for erection.The creation price may be very high.Long dry season may additionally have an effect on the operation.Electrical and Electronics Engineering Interview QuestionsQuestion thirteen. What Is The Water Turbine?Answer :Water turbine is a prime mover used for the alternator at the hydro electric powered strength plant which adjustments the direction of the flowing water and converts the equal to beneficial mechanical power and also gives mechanical electricity to the alternator.Question 14. What Are The Types Of Water Turbines Used In A Hydroelectric Power Plant?Answer :There are sorts of mills, specifically:Impulse turbine,Reaction turbine.Question 15. What Is The Method Of Selection Of Water Turbines?Answer :Impulse turbine is selected for extremely high heads and a small quantity of water because it makes use of the kinetic energy of water. Reaction turbine is chosen for low and medium head and the large amount of water because it utilizes the strain of the water.Nuclear Power Plant Interview QuestionsQuestion 16. What Are The Classifications Of The Hydro-electric Power Station According To Its Heads?Answer :Low head as much as 60 meters.Medium head from 60 meters to 300 meters.High head above three hundred meters.Question 17. What Is The Utility Of Multipurpose Hydroelectric Project?Answer :It offers strength technology, irrigation, fishery and flood manage at the same time.Power Transmission Interview QuestionsQuestion 18. What Are The Names Of Leading Hydro-electric powered Power Station Installed In India?Answer :Bhakra Nangal, Chambal mission, Kayla and so forth.Power Electronics Interview QuestionsQuestion 19. How Is Water Turbines Mounted?Answer :The impulse turbine is hooked up horizontally whereas the response turbine is established vertically.Prev PostAmazon Web Services(AWS) Interview Questions With AnswersNext PostTitleTop 100+ Taxation Interview Questions And AnswersStill Need Help ?We're here to help.
