We are very grateful for our colleagues continued efforts and for having been willing to stay with the show during these difficult times.”The company’s statement also quoted Mr Dragone the director of the show which has been in Macau since 2010, as saying that his team had been “working on reimagining the show.”He added: “Unfortunately, I cannot come to Macau nor can any of my team. The global pandemic has created a situation that is very difficult for all of us, seeing talent leave greatly saddens me… I am very hopeful that we can come to Macau to bring back a reimagined House of Dancing Water.”In this article:casino macau Melco ResortsLatest Casino news from Australasia	Construction stops again at Garapan casinoThe Star Gold Coast to develop new hotel towerCanberra Casino adjusts Covid-19 measuresLatest Casino news from East Asia	Kangwon Land puts employees on mandatory leaveYokohama starts RFP to select partner for IR bidSands China to open The Londoner on February 8Latest Casino news from South Asia	Paradise Co December revenue down 40%Delta Corp receives green light for Goa integrated resortGoa renews casino licencesLatest Casino news from South East Asia	RWG casino complex forced to close for two weeksSuncity establishes new entity for Manila resortResorts World Genting workers test positive for Covid-19Latest Casino news from Elsewhere	Summit Ascent seeks direct VIP model in RussiaSheldon Adelson takes leave for cancer treatmentShambala casino to add poker clubLatest Articles	PointsBet enters new market in the USKangwon Land puts employees on mandatory leaveThailand cracks down on illegal gambling densTAB NZ reports 13% increase in revenue for DecemberRussia’s central bank wages war on online gambling paymentsMacau will not close borders due to Covid-19Follow us!facebooktwitterinstagramlinkedinyoutubeHighlighted InterviewWhy Japan should regulate online gamblingLatest ProductsSimplePlay releases Myth of PhoenixMost Read StoriesYokohama starts RFP to select partner for IR bid	Macau will not close borders due to Covid-19	Macau expands quarantine measures	TAB NZ reports 13% increase in revenue for December	© Focus Gaming News.
