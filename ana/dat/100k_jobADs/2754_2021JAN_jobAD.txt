Program output.ListingsListing 1 . Source code for FirstProgram.DiscussionInstructions for compiling and running the programAssuming that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is properly installed on your computer (see Jb0110: Java OOP: Programming Fundamentals, Getting Started ), do the following to compile and run this program.1. Copy the text from Listing 1 into a text file named FirstProgram.java and store the file in a folder on your disk.2. Open a command-line window in the folder containing the file.3. Type the following command at the prompt to compile the program:javac FirstProgram.java4. Type the following command at the prompt to run the program:java FirstProgramCommentsAny text in the program code that begins with // is a comment. The compiler will ignore everything from the // to the end of the line.Comments were inserted into the program code to explain the code.The compiler also ignores blank lines.Note that this program was designed to illustrate the concepts while being as non-cryptic as possible.Program outputThe program should display the text shown in Figure 1 on the screen except that the time will be different each timeyou run the program.Figure 1 .

Compile the code and execute it. Experiment with the code,making changes, and observing the results of your changes. Make certain that you can explain why your changes behave as they do.MiscellaneousThis section contains a variety of miscellaneous information.Housekeeping materialModule name: Jb0115: Java OOP: First ProgramFile: Jb0115.htmPublished: 11/25/12Questions & Answerswhere we get a research paper on Nano chemistry....?Maira Replynanopartical of organic/inorganic / physical chemistry , pdf / thesis / reviewAliJoin the discussion...Replywhat are the products of Nano chemistry?Maira ReplyThere are lots of products of nano chemistry...
