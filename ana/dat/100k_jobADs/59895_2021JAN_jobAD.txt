Some artists, though, live a bifurcated life with one foot in a separate professional world and one in art. This series looks at how some artists balance their day jobs at their art careers.Alanna Marcelletti: LibrarianInglewood, CAhttps://alannam.pixpa.com/FacebookLinkedInUpcoming show: Co-curator for “Static”, opening December 2017 at Durden and Ray.Art practice:My artwork can be difficult to describe because it doesn’t really fall into the traditional categories of painting or sculpture, it’s really more of a hybrid. Actually, my favorite description of it is as a “portable installation.” They tend to have some interactive component like moveable parts or transparencies that allow the architecture and light of the space they are in to alter the composition. My latest works are based on the toy “Jacob’s Ladder” and they include multiple panels attached in a way that allows them to be rearranged by the curator. I’m really loving them because they can completely transform from show to show.Day job:I work at an elementary school as an associate teacher in the library. I kind of fell into the job when I went back to school for my MFA and needed to switch from the fourth-grade homeroom assistant to something a bit more flexible. Monday through Friday I work with my lead librarian to help students from kindergarten to sixth grade find literature appropriate for their age and reading level. I help maintain the collection of about 15,000 books by processing, weeding, updating records and performing book repairs.This most recent school year, I also had the privilege of co-teaching technology for kindergarten through second grade. It was a special kind of challenge figuring out how to juggle my art practice while making lesson plans about coding, typing skills, digital citizenship and online research tailored to a young age group.Finding balance:I should preface this answer with pointing out some days I balance better than others. Ideally, after my toddler has gone to bed and all lesson plans are finished, I have the night to work on my art. I try to be proactive and get all things day job- related planned far in advance during school holidays to alleviate some of the pressure. Realistically, it can be a bit of a scramble that requires flexibility. Sometimes the most art making I can get in is just quick sketching, the jotting of curation ideas in a notebook, and/or reading a couple of articles online. This coming school year will require less time lesson planning, but I’ve decided to work on my Master of Library and Information Science in the hope of becoming a full-fledged librarian. It’s going to take a bit of adjustment finding the time to study, work, be mom and make art. I know I can do it though since I’ve done it before. I’m just a bit rusty!Impact of day job, positive:I’ve always worked narratively and so I find there is a lot of inspiration in a library. For a while I was very interested in the idea of how we teach children through fiction. It can be as obvious as Aesop’s fables to the subtlety of dystopian societies mirroring current political fears. On a lighter note, there is a level of complexity in picture books that I believe feeds my practice as well. One of my favorite discoveries on our shelf was “Picture This” by Molly Bang. It’s something I refer to regularly when my imagery becomes too literal.Impact of day job, negative:There are times when work requires my full attention and there is just no energy left the in reserve for anything creative. Last year I had to give up my Inglewood studio because my job was taking me to North Hollywood and so my art has been adjusting to being crammed into my one bedroom apartment.Do you want to quit?I would love to cut down on hours for the sake of more studio time, but quitting has never crossed my mind. Plus, the pay allows me to have the stability to afford the cost of making art. There is also something really refreshing about being among books and having access to plenty of inspirational resources. While it can be exhausting sometimes, I usually find I’m still fresh enough after work to want to go home and be creative.Tomorrow, Randi Hokett, Set Decorator.Day Jobs: Alanna Marcelletti, LibrarianDay Jobs: Alanna Marcelletti, LibrarianShare this:TwitterFacebookEmailTumblrMoreRedditPrintPinterestLinkedInLike this:Like Loading...art and cakeabstractAlanna Marcellettiartart and cakeArt and Cake LAArt and Cultureart exhibitionart galleryart openingartistartistsartsassemblagebeverly hillscollagecontemporary artDani DodgedrawingdtlaDurden & Raydurden and rayenvironmentexhibitexhibitionfine artgallerygraphitehollywoodinstallationlos angeleslos angeles artlos angeles artistmixed mediamuseumpaintingphotographysculpturesouthern californiaPublished by AuthorKristine Schomaker is a new media and performance artist, painter and art historian living and working at the Brewery artist complex in Los Angeles. For over 14 years she has been working with various interdisciplinary art forms including online virtual worlds to explore identity and the hybridization of digital media with the physical world. Whether virtual or physical, the object-based work Kristine creates combines elements of color-based gestural abstraction, animation, pattern and design, neo-Baroque and Populence. Using installation, text, photography, mixed media, video and performance for her ongoing conceptual project My Life as an Avatar, she visualizes a narrative/dialogue with her virtual persona, Gracie Kendal. Kristine then documents her experiences on her blog. In 2012, exploring ideas of community, Kristine turned a local gallery into a modern day creation of Gertrude Stein’s salon of the 1920’s with a live mixed-reality dinner party merging the physical world with the online virtual world. Over the summer she also performed The Bald and the Beautiful in which she had her head shaved as a statement to challenge society’s standards of beauty. Currently, Kristine is working as an Artist-in-Residence through the Linden Endowment for the Arts creating an immersive virtual environment which she is planning to bring into the physical world via sculpture/public art work.
