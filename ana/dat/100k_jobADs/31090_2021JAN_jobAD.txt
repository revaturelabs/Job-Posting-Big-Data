Whilstinterviewing I did not declare one of my previous employers. The employment wasonly a few months and I didn’t leave on good terms with that employer.I wanted to know whatinformation on past employers does the UAE government request as part of thework visa/residency visa process. The reason I ask is that I have alsoapplied for Australian immigration and was afraid that the Australianimmigration department in its background check on me would compare employerswith the UAE government. I am afraid since I have declared all my employers(including this one) on my Australian immigration application. So when they seethe difference, they might use this as grounds for rejecting my application.Thank you dear friends very muchshah12Dubai Expat WannabePosts: 8Location: Islamabad PKReplyundefined Oct 30, 2014there are a bunch of unemployment people in the UAEfishableDubai Forum GuestPosts: 2Location: Dubai AEReplyRe: Finding A Job In UAE Apr 03, 2017Dubai and UAE have so many recruitment companies, make sure you dont pay for any job.
