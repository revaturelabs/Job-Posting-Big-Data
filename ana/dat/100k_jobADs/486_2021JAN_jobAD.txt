Over the past 6 months, the visibility has been steadily dropping, to a low of 231 520 a month. However, those numbers are still pretty high, which just highlights the success of Rekrytointi even more. There are 737 followers on Instagram, 5 351 on Twitter and 2 260 on Facebook. The site is available in English and Finnish (even if some parts are not translated, like the \"About Us\" section).Design: From the homepage, the emphasis is on the search engine (keywords, location and radius), which can be used for training experiences or job offers. Oddly enough, if you use it to search training opportunities, you will find nothing. However, if you continue to scroll down on the homepage, you can see a list of categories indicating how job offers and internships each one has. This can also be viewed as a list of cities and provinces. In the job listing, publication dates, logos and even expiry dates are visible. While you scroll, you don’t see the filters on the left-hand side, but you can bring up the different criteria (area of expertise, type of employment, type of hours, country, experience, publication date, language) at the top of the page.The job board objective: Rekrytointi (which means “recruitment”) is all about recruiting in Finland.Recruiter observations: To recruit, you must contact the team.Jobseeker observations: To create an “expert” account, you must include a lot of information, including a brief description, your mother tongue and additional documents (if you have any). You can also apply to jobs, which will redirect you to another page.The job offers: There are currently 978 job offers and no training experiences. Among the top categories, we have: heath, customer service and maintenance.Reactivity: The team answers within a day.Special features: The blog (nothing new since March and only in Finnish); the LAURA recruitment system.Verdict: Rekrytointi could definitely use a few extra special features, but that aside, it excels in creating an attractive interface and easy-to-us site. As a recruitment agency, the team can offer more than just job posting.Written by Ali NeillAs the job board tester and blog editor for the Jobboard Finder, Ali works on job boards from all around the world and keeps a close eye on the recruitment trends thanks to a number of sources, including the website's social media pages.Login here for FREE to unlock access to the traffic audience, content and pricing section for more information on Rekrytointi.com.Sign up to access this feature, it’s FREE!You already have an account?
