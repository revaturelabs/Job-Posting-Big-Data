Too many HR job searchers apply for the too few available jobs. Employers' expectations of professionalism from people who apply for HR jobs are sky high—with reason.People who apply for Human Resources jobs should follow directions and receive stellar grades for their written application materials. People searching for these jobs should know the ropes when interviewing and following up with the employer.People who want an HR job should conduct every aspect of their job search with insider knowledge and professionalism.But, too many don’t. HR job searchers fail to follow directions; they apply for jobs for which they don’t qualify, and they act as if the well-researched, available body of job searcher advice does not apply to them.The Human Resources Job Searcher—Employer MatchMany Human Resources employers seek a polished professional with experience in the HR position for which they are applying.

The market is full of HR assistants who want to become HR generalists and HR generalists attempting to land jobs as HR managers.Other HR job searchers are trying to transition into an HR job from another field. Depending on their education, prior jobs, and how easily they can position their experience as related to HR, some will succeed in finding an HR job.Other HR job searchers want to move into the HR field because they want to work with people; often they have no experience and their degrees are in such subjects as sociology and psychology. In a growing trend, lawyers seek work in the HR field.The reality in HR job searching is that almost everyone with the background and experience or the willingness to obtain them, the desire and will, and a professional job search, can eventually find an HR job. The HR job may not be at the level the job searcher desires and the pay may be below expectations.
