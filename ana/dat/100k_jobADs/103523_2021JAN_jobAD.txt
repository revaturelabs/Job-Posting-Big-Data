I was looking for durable support stockings to cover up my varicose veins and I’ve tried many brands and none of them lasted more than 2 months. I especially like the Jobst Opaque panty hose style because it serves two of my purposes – it helps hide my bulging tummy and I need not to worry about my stockings falling down! What amazes me more is that despite its compression, Jobst Opaque is so easy to put on! Compared to the other brands I’ve tried before, by far I am happy with Jobst Opaque. With its smooth and soft texture, it feels good against my skin even if I wear it all day. I definitely recommend Jobst Opaque to everyone looking for a pair of compression stockings to conceal their varicose veins or any leg blemishes, definitely Jobst Opaque does the job!
