Currently I’m self-employed and I continue to work with Kirsten to get clear about the most effective way to communicate and market my services.\" -- RF, educator and parent coach\"Kirsten is compassionate and practical, good at steering the focus toward concrete goals, and good at getting me to feel empowered and excited about the goals I am trying to reach. And her experience as a counselor and professional writer adds to the value she brings to coaching. I would recommend her to anyone looking for help moving forward – she’s great!\" -- SB, college professorWhat strengths do you have as a coach?I place a high value on concrete, clearly-defined action: I’ll ask you to get very clear about the steps you need to take; I’ll ask you to commit to taking those steps; you and I will determine whether and how your actions move you forward; and we’ll adjust our process as necessary if you aren’t moving forward in the way you’d like.I’m truly committed to my clients’ work- and life satisfaction, and I have a highly-developed respect for my clients. I’m nonjudgmental, I’m very interested, and I’m also very down-to-earth, with an active sense of humor.Some clients think or do things that get in the way of their professional development. My professional background has provided me with training in a range of tools that neutralize self-sabotage or self-doubt – and I’m able to help clients use these tools in concrete and structured ways.What is your coaching philosophy?\"Are you dissatisfied with some aspect of your work (or life)? I help clients achieve that which is most important to them, and I also help clients to transform those situations, perspectives, or habits that get in the way of this achievement. You were meant to thrive, to work and live in a way that satisfies you and fits with who you are and what you need!\"What types of people do you typically coach?Small business owners seeking to take their venture to the next levelProfessionals seeking a career changeIndividuals who are frustrated with work (or home) due to gaps in boundary-setting skills or anger/conflict-management skillsIndividuals facing challenging work- or life transitionsIndividuals who feel \"stuck\" in work or relationships due to \"internal\" factors, for example, \"unhelpful\" habits, perspectives or beliefsWhat is your professional background?I have my BA in psychology; a master’s in clinical social work; and extensive training in positive assertiveness and conflict resolution; and I worked with folks as a psychotherapist prior to entering the world of coaching.
