I had considerable trouble with most of them crashing... but using your product I was able to isolate and solve the problems I was having.

Using SQL Server Agent jobs, you can automate administrative tasks and run them on a recurring basis. You can run a job manually or schedule it to run in response to schedules and alerts. Jobs can be written to run on the local instance of Microsoft SQL or on multiple servers. To run jobs on multiple servers, you must set up at least one master server and one or more target servers.Anyone can create a job, but a job can be edited only by its owner or members of the sysadmin role.Only one instance of the job can be run at a time. If you try to run a job manually while it is running as scheduled, SQL Server Agent refuses the request.To prevent a scheduled job from running, you should either disable the schedule using the corresponding option of the Schedule Editor dialog window, or disable the job using Job Editor, drop the schedule using the Drop Schedule item of the popup menu in the Available Schedules field of Job Editor, or stop the SQLSERVERAGENT service on the server.Note: Before starting a job make sure that the SQLSERVERAGENT service is currently running on the server.How can I create a new job?New jobs are created within Create Job Wizard. In order to run this wizard you should either• select the Jobs list or any object from that list and then use the Create New Job item from the popup menuor• open the server in Server Editor and the Jobs tab there and press Insert or select the Create New Job item from the popup menu (Alternatively, use the corresponding link of the Navigation Bar).How can I edit an existing job?Jobs are edited within Job Editor. In order to open the editor you should either• select the job for editing in the explorer tree (type the first letters of the job name for quick search);• select the Edit Job item from the popup menuor• open the server in Server Editor and the Jobs tab there;• select the job to edit;• press the Enter key or select the Edit Job item from the popup menu (alternatively, you can use the corresponding link of the Navigation Bar).How can I drop a job?To drop the existing job:• select the job to drop in the explorer tree;• select the Drop Job item from the popup menuor• open the server in Server Editor and the Jobs tab there;• select the job to drop;• press the Delete key or select the Drop Job item from the popup menu (alternatively, you may use the corresponding link of the Navigation Bar)and confirm dropping in the dialog window.A job step is an action that the job takes on a database or a server. Every job must have at least one job step.
