You victimize people who do not use Steam by not releasing patches to non steam users until days/weeks after they are released on Steam. You offer Steam user free skins which can not be downloaded by non Steam users.By not treating all paying customers the same you are in breach of human rights laws. If they choose to not use Steam then you should make sure the patch is available to them at the same time as Steam users. Your Halloween skins should also be available to them at the same time. Any competitions should also be available to all paying customers not just the ones who use World of Trucks.You can not force people into using Steam or World of Trucks by ignoring all the users who have paid for this game and do not want to use Steam or World of Truck.Your company has no ethics and breaches European rules. Who are your lawyers. Hitler, Goebbels and Hess ?ReplyDeleteRepliesAnonymous December 6, 2013 at 11:38 PMits so easy to activate the game on steam. I paid 35 Euros for ets2 back in 2012 (because it had to be shipped to my house). When the Halloween DLC was released i activated the game in order to use it. Any genuine ets2 key can be activated.DeleteRepliesReplyUnknown December 6, 2013 at 11:39 PMInteresting way of looking at it..However, the patches are released on the homepage at the same time as steam, the only thing you can't get without steam is the public beta updates so i really don't get what you are complaining about in that regard.that being said, they don't break any laws what so ever by releasing skins etc. on steam and not in their own online store.. if they had said \"hey, you are black, you can't buy this\" then it could be a racism law that prohibitet it, however they do allow anyone to buy it, they just don't put it on sale on all sale platforms...Now calm down m8DeleteRepliesReplyInfinity December 6, 2013 at 11:53 PM@AnonymousDecember 6, 2013 at 11:19 PMHow Steam and WoTR is related? If you like use your retail key in WoTR and you could upload pictures too, right from the game! They doing it for free for all people. And using WoTR will give your game additional features.DeleteRepliesReplyWomble December 7, 2013 at 12:11 AMI do realize you can activate a retail version on Steam. I do use Steam for games which I have to use Steam for but, I choose not to use ETS2 on it.The patches are not released on the home page at the same time. At the time of typing this the Steam version is 1.8 which includes the Scania Streamline and the highest version on the update page is 1.7.1. This game was sold to everyone at roughly the same time. Of course people who download it get the game first. Those who choose the retail version get it the same day of release at what time of course depends on where you live and the delivery provider. Patches on the other hand are down to SCS. And because I do not use Steam I am not able to have it at the same time. That is Victimization. So they are breaking the law. Like it or not. What SCS are doing is no different to being a racist except they are not saying you can not have this patch at the same time as the white man because you are black, they are telling me I can not have this patch or any of the beta patches like a Steam user, because I am not a Steam user. Where is the difference ?I am quite calm by the way. I just will not sit here any longer while SCS seem to think they can treat people who have paid there money just like everyone else differently just because they do not use Steam or World of Trucks.DeleteRepliesReplyKatixa December 7, 2013 at 12:44 AMHonestly there's people I don't understand. First let me remind you that when they started on Steam, the first couple patches were released first on their website, clearly saying \"not for steam users\", because those would ge the patch later. I'm pretty sure you didn't complain then. In anycase, even if I wanted that patch badly, I just waited.Currently, comparing Steam version to any download version is like previously comparing a boxed edition and download version. \"Hey, the patch is available on the website but the updated box isn't on the store yet, wtf? I have to wait 2 weeks until they put it on the store? they should release online only when I have MY box on the store too!\".SCS already explained why they can release betas and patches faster on Steam than other ways. If you have so much hurry, activate the game on Steam, it's not the devil many people think. Or else you can just wait, same I did and I still do in certain games and situations. I hope you don't pretend a developer to hold a finished version for a platform until the version for another platform gets finished, so nobody \"complains\". Depending situations maybe they can do it, but in others it's just no-sense. As an example, there you have Skyrim. PC, Xbox, PS3... sometimes one would get the patch, sometimes another one (microsoft/sony validation, unexpected bugs on a platform, etc...). But those with the patch finished and ready, of course got it. In ETS2 case as they said they just have to hit a couple buttons to upload a patch on Steam, and hit another couple buttons to disable the patch if it's broken. That CAN'T be done on a normal version.DeleteRepliesReplyUnknown December 7, 2013 at 12:52 AM@WombleSorry to dissapoint, but the official version on steam right now is 1.7.1. Do no, the official release is still the same, steam users does however have the option to request beta versions, but those are BETA's and non tested meaning you risk loosing your game progress by using it...So no, you have the same version on the homepage as you have on steam.DeleteRepliesReplyWomble December 7, 2013 at 1:04 AM@Infinity I do understand that and thanks for telling me but, I do not want to use World of Trucks or Steam. However I would like to be able to get the latest patch at the same time as a Steam user can. This currently can not be done. SCS seem to think that people like me who have paid there money and even brought the add even though I hardly venture past Amsterdam. But, I was quite happy to pay for it if it meant that it then gave SCS money to improve this game, are then forgot about. Kicked to the back. Steam users then ride about in a new truck and improved version of the game and have the option of beta patches if they so wish. While I have to sit here like a fair few other people waiting for SCS to release the update. Whether a Steam user or not, black or white, rich or poor, blue with bright blue spots. The patch and any competition should be available to everyone who has purchased this game not just for certain people who are registered with Steam or World of Trucks.DeleteRepliesReplySNinja December 7, 2013 at 8:46 AM@Womble;Mate you got to understand that WoTR is open for all genuine ETS2 gamers and not just steamers. WoTR is a site where we post our screenies, much like a forum but just pictures and comments. Yes! we could have done that in the SCS forum but that would have turned ugly and heavy on the forum software and maintaining it would have been a nightmare. Instead SCS thought about WoTR which we should be thankful for.You have it wrong when you say steamers get patches earlier than non steamers. Even if they do it'd be just a difference of a few hours due to steam's easy infrastructure. As many have explained earlier, steamers are given the CHOICE to test betas which in no way are fully tested finalized patches. So please dont cry foul and understand the difference between a final patch and testing betas.DeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous December 7, 2013 at 3:09 PMHuman rights violations? Victimization? Comparison to tyrants?I can't believe these people took your post seriously.Wake up to yourself, mate.You obviously have life way too easy if you compare such things to missing out on a competition because you refuse to activate your game on Steam, something you can CHOOSE to do if you wish.DeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous December 7, 2013 at 3:19 PM\"What SCS are doing is no different to being a racist except they are not saying you can not have this patch at the same time as the white man because you are black, they are telling me I can not have this patch or any of the beta patches like a Steam user, because I am not a Steam user. Where is the difference ?\"Did you really just make that comparison? I mean, really?Race is not a choice, using Steam, or not using Steam, IS a choice.You have chosen not to use Steam, so you miss out on the additional Steam freebies.I see you've never experienced racism, or you wouldn't make such a ludicrous comparison!DeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous December 7, 2013 at 3:32 PMThey had free food-tasting at the local supermarket today.I was victimized because I choose to buy my groceries on the internet and so I was not able to try any of the free food tasting offered to in store customers!I pay the same price for my groceries so why should I miss out on in-store promotions just because I choose to shop online! This is just like racism and human rights violations committed by Hitler!DeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous December 7, 2013 at 3:49 PMThe reason they go for Steam Users is its 10x times faster to upload an patch then having to upload it to lots of other sites. And i can't see why you wouldn't use steam its only an benefit.DeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous December 7, 2013 at 9:55 PM+1DeleteRepliesReplyReplyWomble December 7, 2013 at 1:27 AM@Martin TastensenSo where is my option to use the Beta ? Sorry to disappoint but SCS are still treating me differently as I do not have this option. If the Beta is good enough for Steam users then it is good enough for Non steam users.ReplyDeleteRepliesUnknown December 7, 2013 at 3:24 AMTo test the beta you have to use steam.. but then again, the Beta is NOT! a final patch, meaning that it is only supposed to be tested with the final goal to find any undiscovered bugs that might have been overlooked in the initial testing.Which again means that it's not something all users normally gets access to, in this case SCS have just decided that people can sign up for them if they wish through steam.Take a look around in generel in the industry, SCS and many other small developers use steam as beta testing ground, you just don't see it since most other developers don't give the public access to their beta.Now here comes the funny part, do you know how many resources it takes the SCS staff to release a patch for the game, they have to first release it on steam, then build a .exe file to patch the game, then the must upload it to their own servers, change the links, create torrent files and link to these, if they had to do that with every beta build they would waste way to much time only to maintain their download site. By letting steam control their beta versions, they only have to release every beta update at one single site, nothing else plus they can grant limited access to this beta site or create 10 or 15 smaller beta build in between to test smaller bug fixes for an even smaller group. So no, it has nothing to do with the patch being good enough for the steam users but not good enough to non steam users, it simply has something to do with how much work and resources they have to dedicate to grant access to non steam users access to every beta buildAnd to make it clear, it is NOT normal procedure for a game developer to allow open access to their beta, and by buying the game you are in no way entitled to get access to the betaDeleteRepliesReplyWomble December 7, 2013 at 10:09 AM@Martin TastensenI have looked around and yes there are other developers who use Steam who then give access to beta. These tend to be Steam only games though. ETS2 is available either by using Steam or not using Steam. If I then choose not to use Steam this is where the segregation starts. Because of this I am then not entitled to access to the beta version. Most developers do as you pointed out only use in house beta testers, this I seem to remember was how SCS used to do it. Now you can now use Steam SCS now allow you to have access to beta but, if you do not use it then you do not have the opportunity to use a beta. Is it right to segregation people because they do not use Steam ? I personally would like as I am sure other would to be able to use the beta, but as I prefer not to use Steam this is not possible.I fully understand the process of adding a patch no need to explain that one. If SCS do not have the resources to treat both section the same then ETS2 should have released as a Steam only game. Wait, they could do that because Steam would not add it to there list of games would they. People like me then supported SCS by buying the game and even voting for it on greenlight and now we are treated in this way as we prefer not to use steam for this game. How ironic.I agree by buying the game I was not expecting to have access to beta but neither should a Steam user. If however Steam users are then offered a beta patch and the game is not exclusive to Steam then that beta patch should be offered to all game formats. If it can not be offered in this way then the beta patch should be kept in house.We could go on all day with me putting my argument and then you defending SCS. So I will make this my last post. I am only here to express my opinion on what I believe to be wrong. Others may disagree, that is there choice.Other may think it is fine that the people who helped SCS get to where they are now are being treated in this way because if they want a beta patch they have to join Steam. I believe that as SCS have given us the choice we should be able to choose. If the person then chooses not to use Steam then this should not give SCS the right to then treat them differently to other just because there choice is different to the one SCS want them to choose.Segregation in any form is illegal and immoral. Is what SCS are doing illegal ? I let other above my pay grade decide that one. Is it immoral, I believe it is.I doubt very much my comments/opinions will probably even be read by anyone from SCS. They are fast becoming a big company now and as we all know they come with very clever lawyers and the moral of alley cats. After years of supporting SCS though if it continues to be the case that we are segregated into Steam and non Steam users regarding beta patches then I for one will no longer support SCS with my money. I know, one person hardly going to notice that but, at least my conscience is clear.As this will be my last post on the subject. (I do not see the point of going over and over the same thing. My point is made, will this change anything. I very much doubt it.) I would like to finish my post on a happier note by Wishing everyone here a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.DeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous December 7, 2013 at 10:33 AMSeriously what the fuck is wrong with you? Who the hell cares if you choose not to use the easier way (steam)? Should you be treated like a king, and offered the beta patches as well thorugh their private homepage? What segregation? There is no segregation from SCS, because you choose yourself to be segregated. They are in no way obliged to offer you the betas, and nor do they owe you anything. Get off your high horse. Even in real life if the government offers you a chance to go to university for free, but you decline saying you don't want to, then fuck the rest, who did just because they live with the opportunity? If you can't realize, that you are sturring yourself in your own ****, then no one can help you. SCS with their very clever lawyers... Seriously lawyers for this? What the...? Ehh, nevermind.DeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous December 7, 2013 at 11:33 AM1. I fail to understand why @Womble is so hell bent to test the betas?2. SCS has made it clear in the Scania Streamline blog why steam was preferred for beta testings.3. Guys like @Womble are the ones who will cry and scream like air horns when SCS gets delayed introducing the next patch. Just bcoz they wasted their time, efforts n $$$ creating non steam betas only to achieve what?.... thats right,, Nothing!Thank God SCS wont go that way and upcoming patches wont get delayed bcoz of such foolishness.Straight n Simple > Wanna test betas, get steam [period]DeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous December 7, 2013 at 3:55 PMCoca-Cola are offering a promotion to win a prize, but you have to buy specially marked bottles to enter.I CHOOSE to only drink Coke in cans, not bottles! So I can not enter to win a prize!Why is coca cola segregating bottle drinkers and can drinkers!This is immoral!This is exactly the same thing you are trying to say about steam and non-steam users.You are trying to, I believe, compare racial segregation (where people are segregated due to a factor they had no choice in) with the separation of content available to steam and non-steam users.You keep saying you don't have a choice, but I believe everyone who has bought the game legit received a key that he/she can use to activate their game on steam?If this is the case, you have a CHOICE. Race is not a choice, it is something you were born with. SCS have given their reasons why some content is only available to Steam users, if you choose not to use steam, you are missing out because of your own choices.Now, stop whining about your comfortable life and comparing it to REAL human rights violations.DeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous December 8, 2013 at 10:28 AMIf you look at any of the search engines and type: \"is segragation illegal?\", you will probably find it only concerns different coloured races - you know, a law that actually makes sense and applies in the real world. Stop f***ing complaining about this segragation over a computer game and stop calling SCS racists. Anyway, there aren't a race of people who choose to play on Steam or via retail.

Enjoy!DeleteRepliesReplySteven Barker December 10, 2013 at 1:11 PMWomble,As an employee of Amnesty International I am very deeply offended by almost all of your comments in regard to race and segregation.Please remember that segregation is a forced, humiliating and sometimes violent public separation of one group of people, in an effort to undermine them for racial, religious, gender or socio-economic reasons, by another group of people.What you are describing does not in any way constitute segregation and your continued petulant, entitlement oriented, rants make me sick to my stomach when I think of the pain and suffering that people, who are genuinely segregated, have to go through on a daily basis. Suffering that make your mealy-mouthed complaints sound hollow and empty.You are practicing pigeon chess, you fly in knock all the pieces down, crap on the board and fly away as if you won the argument. You did not.I have tried in my life to never hate a person, because I might not know what they are going through, but you are stretching my ability to do so and your continued defence of an indefensible position has made me so angry that I could no longer contain my frustration with you.Please, in future, think before you type especially when what you type presents an image of you that is so self-involved and self-indulgent that you resemble a small child.DeleteRepliesReplyReplyAnonymous December 7, 2013 at 1:43 AMI hope that the winners of the competition and the good trucks become official skins for Euro Truck Simulator 2!

The way I see it is as follows:-You bought a game from SCS because of what it contained at that time.-SCS is not obliged in any way to give you extra content (patches which are free, DLC's which cost $) but they chose to do it because they value their community.-They chose Steam because it's cheaper for them, and at a certain extent it's cheaper for the buyers and more convenient too.So do whatever you want regarding ETS2 and Steam and WoTr, but please stop with the off-topic entitlement-filled posts.ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous December 10, 2013 at 10:49 PMgotta question: the winter competition is for trucks ONLY or can I present a trailer painted ?ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous December 10, 2013 at 10:53 PMis there a new euro truck game coming out with the new shape trucks in it . if so when . and happy x.mas all ..ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyNew year Indore December 11, 2013 at 7:56 AMYes i like this blog valuable information inside it i love whole posting and feedback.ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous December 19, 2013 at 10:57 AMIt would be great to have the game downloadable from the app storeReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous December 19, 2013 at 10:59 AMCheck out http://worldoftrucks.com/en/ReplyDeleteRepliesAnonymous December 20, 2013 at 2:37 PMAND https://worldoftrucks.com/en/online_profile.php?id=53106DeleteRepliesReplyReplyJourneymart December 19, 2013 at 1:23 PMI hope that the winners of the competition and the good trucks become official skins for Euro Truck Simulator 2!
