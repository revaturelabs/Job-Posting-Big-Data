I thought “How much could this really benefit me?” I’ve had about 3 weeks to work with the plugin, and I have to say I’m blown away. Not having to think about that $fields array for the front end; then the back end array; and then the display function for each field, an investment of 80 bucks has saved me $100s of dollars in time. It makes custom field management effortless, allowing me to focus on billable time rather than tweaking PHP code. Look forward to getting to know more about and investing in your other work. Solutions this great definitely need support. Please keep up the great work!Blue P Developer at Gastonia.com http://gastonia.comWP Job Manager Field Editor is an essential tool if you’re looking to customize your WP Job Manager Plugin. It reduces all the hassle and saves you so much time than to tweak the code.Myles really goes the extra miles(no pun intended) when he replies on your support ticket. Instead of being like the developers of other plugins/themes who pushes the responsibility to others, he really tries his best to resolve your issue.Thank you so much Myles! Great plugin, even greater support! Definitely got back the investment of the plugin many times over.Lex Web Developer http://tutors.com.sgRecent ReviewsSearch and Filtering for WP Job Manager5 out of 5by DanielSearch and Filtering for WP Job Manager5 out of 5by RyanTerms and ConditionsRefund PolicysMyles Plugins © 2021.
