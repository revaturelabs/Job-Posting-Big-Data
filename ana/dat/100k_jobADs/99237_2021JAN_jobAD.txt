And transportation electrification can pull us through the pandemic-induced economic downturn.Cortney Piper | Guest columnistShow CaptionHide CaptionGeneration E ad for General Motors new electric vehicle campaignGM unveils a new marketing campaign, a new logo and will have a new website as it moves forward to become an all-electric car maker.General MotorsCortney Piper serves as executive director of the Tennessee Advanced Energy Business Council.By almost any metric, Tennessee had a strong 2020 in advanced energy, a robust sector with 18,000 businesses contributing nearly $40 billion to the state’s gross domestic product. And the year’s growth in the state’s electric vehicle landscape received national and international headlines. As that happened, more elected officials realized that advanced energy means job creation, which stretches beyond political lines and helps Tennesseans directly in a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has tightened other areas of employment.General Motors, Volkswagen and NissanAmong the 2020 victories are General Motors’ $2 billion plan for its electric vehicle plant in Spring Hill that will build Cadillac’s SUV. Volkswagen announced its own EV SUV at its Chattanooga plant. Last January, VW, the University of Tennessee, the UT Research Foundation and Oak Ridge National Laboratory partnered on VW’s first innovation hub in North America at the UT Research Park at Cherokee Farm. And in the fall, VW broke ground on a $22 million Chattanooga lab to test EV batteries.With leadership from Gov. Bill Lee, Tennesseans can anticipate more growth in advanced energy and job creation. Electric vehicles are a primary focus for state resources, which included incentives for the GM plant. Nissan and VW have also worked closely with state and local government over the years.Bob Rolfe, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, said that Lee’s goal is to make Tennessee the country’s most business-friendly state and praised the EV progress in a December Tennessee Advanced Energy Business Council (TAEBC) webinar. Electric vehicle jobs are advanced energy jobs. And transportation electrification can pull us through this pandemic-induced economic downturn just like energy has done countless times before, starting in 1933 with the Tennessee Valley Authority.Your state.

While federal efforts through ORNL and TVA drive Appalachia and the Southeast forward, they can deepen that impact by developing and deploying new technology in the power sector to reduce carbon, stimulate business and create new jobs. ORNL and UT’s research base can be leveraged to push innovation into the public power model through TVA’s seven-state reach in the Southeast. TAEBC is excited for those potential developments and encourages Lee’s administration to continue to look to advanced energy for economic wins.Hear more Tennessee voices: Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought-provoking columns.These aren’t just pie-in-the-sky hopes. We know from the 2018 Tennessee Advanced Energy Economic Impact Report that advanced energy contributes $39.7 billion to state gross domestic product and employs nearly 360,000 Tennesseans. Looking ahead, Tennessee can position itself to take advantage of new federal legislation, such as the Energizing Tech Transfer Act or the Technology Transitions Act.While Congress works on those acts, a $2 trillion investment in American advanced energy infrastructure, research and development is expected from the incoming presidential administration. Tennessee must tap into that investment.Supporting advanced energy isn’t political; it’s economic development. The governor gets that idea, as he has shown leadership on making Tennessee the No. 1 state in the country for electric vehicle manufacturing.Congress has shown it understands that as well by drafting multiple pieces of legislation supporting the idea that advanced energy means job creation.TAEBC is looking forward to releasing an updated economic impact report in 2021, and more partnerships with Tennessee elected leaders, UT, ORNL and other TAEBC members. The future is promising for advanced energy in Tennessee and the Southeast.Cortney Piper serves as executive director of the Tennessee Advanced Energy Business Council.Facebook Twitter EmailShare your feedback to help improve our site!HelpTerms of ServiceYour California Privacy Rights/Privacy PolicyPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesDo Not Sell My Info/Cookie Policy© Copyright Gannett 2021"
