Solid colors are best; avoid busy prints or patterns.Wear clothes that fit you very well.Do NOT wear low-cut tops or dresses.Do NOT wear short skirts or short dresses.NO rips, safety pins, or missing buttons.Wear a bra and all other basic underwear.Wear simple, clean shoes, NOT new shoes! Low heels are good, but if you‚Äôre not used to walking in heels, DON‚ÄôT wear them to an interview.Shoes should have CLOSED TOES AND CLOSED HEELS!If you wear a skirt or dress, wear pantyhose. NO BARE LEGS.If you carry a purse, keep it simple. Don‚Äôt cram your resume into your purse.Make sure your purse, shoes, and outfit go together.Accessories:If you wear a scarf, tie or arrange it neatly. DON‚ÄôT just toss it around your neck.The rule for jewelry is: SILENCE IS GOLDEN! Do NOT clink, jingle, or jangle.Wear simple, minimal jewelry, like a ring, a watch or stylish bracelet, and/or a simple necklace, and earrings.TAKE OUT ANY JEWELRY YOU WEAR IN BODY PIERCINGS!!!!!Tattoos and Nails:Your toes will be covered, but not your fingernails.Keep fingernails short clean and well-manicured.Nail polish should be light, subdued colors with no art.Tattoos must be covered if visible on your hands, face or neck.
