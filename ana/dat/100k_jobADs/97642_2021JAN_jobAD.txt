Naughty Leah has been getting speeding tickets. Three of them. Rick having warmed her up with his hand, doesn’t think a hand spanking is sufficient.***Rick stopped. His hand lifted off her back, the one that she realised had kept her still and unmoving throughout. Opening her eyes, she saw him walk about the room, searching for something, picking up items and then putting them down. She propped her body up on her elbows.“Stay down. We’re not finished. Remember, six for each ticket?”“Can’t you use your hand?” she pleaded.“No. It has to be something you will take note of. In any case, my hand is a little sore,” he said with a brief chuckle.Leah guffawed. “All right for some,” she snapped.Rick waggled a finger at her. “Don’t be disrespectful, Miss Leah, or I shall add another six.”***What does he find to spank her with I wonder 🙂For other participants, please follow the link:Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...RelatedCategories Blog Hop Tags #satspanks, Driven Wild, punishment, spanking Post navigationDungeon Crawl – Spanked in a NightclubDungeon Crawl – Spanked in the Kitchen17 thoughts on “Satspanks – The right tool for the job”	Natasha Knight24/05/2014 at 10:40	 | Reply	I’m curious!! A pre-congrats on the upcoming release Jaye.Jaye Peaches28/05/2014 at 09:31	 | Reply	Thanks Natasha 🙂Tara Finnegan24/05/2014 at 12:20	 | Reply	Nice, Leah gets to watch his hunt 😀 I’ll bet each item he handles leads to a little thrill.Jaye Peaches28/05/2014 at 09:33	 | Reply	A very nervous watcher. It won’t be the last time he makes her wait. 🙂PK Corey24/05/2014 at 13:44	 | Reply	Now I really want to know what he comes up with. Love the snippet.Jaye Peaches28/05/2014 at 09:35	 | Reply	Maybe I might reveal next time 🙂Leigh Smith24/05/2014 at 13:49	 | Reply	I don’t know the answer to the question but I would have had a different answer to his comment that his hand hurt. I’m sure it wouldn’t have gone well for me but my mouth spills out what the mind is thinking.Jaye Peaches28/05/2014 at 09:36	 | Reply	Lol. Learning to keep the mouth shut can be a challenge 😉Cara Bristol24/05/2014 at 14:38	 | Reply	I’m curious. My guess is a hairbrush.Jaye Peaches28/05/2014 at 09:37	 | Reply	Interesting guess, but they’re not in a bedroom 🙂Jolynn Raymond24/05/2014 at 16:09	 | Reply	I’m sure he can be resourceful. The answer depends on which room they are in. Kitchen could mean wooden spoon, bedroom could mean hairbrush. You’ve tickled my curiosity.Jaye Peaches28/05/2014 at 09:40	 | Reply	Ah, now I can reveal they’re not in a domestic environment, so nothing from kitchen or bedroom. More clues next week 😉Normandie Alleman24/05/2014 at 16:13	 | Reply	Intriguing. Will you tell us next week?Jaye Peaches28/05/2014 at 09:42	 | Reply	Just for you I shall reveal a little more 🙂Rayanna Jamison25/05/2014 at 23:14	 | Reply	Oh, that’s never good. 🙂 For a backside anyway 😉 For a reader, on the other hand…Jaye Peaches28/05/2014 at 09:43	 | Reply	Always better for the reader 😉Roz Harrison29/05/2014 at 11:11	 | Reply	Ooh, you are a tease Jaye, I’m definitely curious! Poor Rick with a sore hand lol.
