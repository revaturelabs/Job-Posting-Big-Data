Blurry, tiny you in the far distance? What message does your LinkedIn profile photo send?Your LinkedIn profile photo is the first way to meet someone. You want to be sure to send the right message – the message that supports your professional brand.A profile picture of you having a great time at a party sends the message that you might not be focusing your attention on business interests. It is your business what you do in your spare time. Don’t muddy the water by looking like a stoner.I have seen profile photos of folks standing around dead critters with guns. This hobby does not appeal to everyone and can be divisive. Why take the risk that the hiring manager for your ideal job is turned off by hunting? Again, your hobbies are YOUR business.Here are a few tips to use your LinkedIn profile picture for your best advantage:Get a professional headshot. PLEASE!! Not a photo of you that your best buddy takes of you in the hallway, against that beige closet door. A professional can light you beautifully and include a background that makes you look your best. It doesn’t have to cost a fortune. Support your local community and find a photographer in the neighborhood.Don’t use a selfie! In my honest opinion, selfies generally look terrible as a LinkedIn profile picture. If money is a problem and you can’t afford a professional photographer, check out these tips, 4 Ways to Get a Professional LinkedIn Headshot on a Budget.Smile and look at the camera. Black and white mood shots are great if you are a professional photographer or if you are in the arts. The rest of us should have a color headshot, smiling at the camera with wide open eyes.Just you – not a group photo. A recent client had a profile picture that included 2 people. Which one was him? Turns out one of the people in the photo was a VIP who headed his organization. Since I was unfamiliar with that VIP, I had no idea which one was my client. Why make people go through that hard work?Wear clothing that supports your brand. Exercise clothes are perfect for fitness instructors, but not investment bankers. A formal suit is great for big time consultants, but not fitness instructors. Folks working for start-ups can be casual. I use several photos – some with a jacket and some with just a blouse, simple and not distracting.Choose colors that support your brand. A consultant I know has a business called “Indigo.” She wears blue all the time. Another friend loves purple. He is wearing the palest purple shirt in his new headshots. These colors are an important part of their professional brands.Extend your brand to other social media and job search materials. Your business cards and personal website should use the same (or similar) headshot and colors. Tie it all together so the recruiters and other folks looking at your LinkedIn profile get a good understanding of who you are.Your LinkedIn profile picture is the first impression you give to folks looking at your profile. Consider, carefully, the impression you want to leave to recruiters and hiring managers!!For some tips on LinkedIn, check out The Interview Doctor’s Five tips to Kick off a Successful Job Search or Career Transition.Share the KnowledgeFiled Under: Job Search, Linkedin, LinkedIn for Job Search Tagged With: Best LinkedIn profile photo, brand your LinkedIn profile, express your personal brand in your LinkedIn profile photo, LinkedIn for job seekers, linkedin profile, LinkedIn profile photo, professional headshot for LinkedIn, what do recruiters look for in a LinkedIn profile photoReader InteractionsLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
