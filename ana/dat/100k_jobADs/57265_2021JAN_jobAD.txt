The right, urgent, measures, could make the difference between survival and collapse.”Nearly 200 million people could end up out of workThe outbreak is expected to wipe out 6.7% of working hours across the world during the second quarter of 2020.That is the equivalent of 195 million full-time workers losing their jobs.The worst-hit region is predicted to be the Arab states, with an 8.1% decline in working hours (five million full-time workers).The ILO says it is “the most severe crisis” since World War Two.It adds that the eventual increase in global unemployment during the course of 2020 will depend largely on two factors:How quickly the world economy recovers in the second half of the yearHow effectively policy measures will boost the demand for labourThere is a high risk that the end-of-year worldwide unemployment figure will be much higher than an initial ILO projection of 25 million people.Accommodation services and manufacturing badly hitDifferent sectors of the economy have been hit in different ways by the sudden downturn in work.Not surprisingly, with travel at a minimum and social lives put on hold, the accommodation and food services industries are among those suffering most, along with manufacturing, wholesale and retail, and real estate and business.Together, they account for nearly 38% of the global workforce, with 1.25 billion people employed in these industries around the world.Americas and Europe have most high-risk workersThe percentage of people around the world in high-risk jobs varies considerably.A total of 43.2% of people in the Americas and 42.1% in Europe and Central Asia work in high-risk sectors.These regions have far fewer informal workers, who make up the majority of the workforce in Africa, the Arab states and Asia and the Pacific.While these workers play a crucial role in the economy, especially in countries like India, Nigeria and Brazil, they miss out on things like social protection, that other permanent workers have.Altered by NZ Fiji TimesImage source - EPA- Advertisement -ShareFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedinViberEmailnzfijitimesLEAVE A REPLY Cancel replyPlease enter your comment!Please enter your name hereYou have entered an incorrect email address!Please enter your email address hereSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.- Advertisement -POPULAR POSTSAmerican Magic are refusing to give up on the America’s Cupnzfijitimes - January 19, 2021 8:18 amThe 25 midwives taking care of the Tropical Cyclone Yasa affected areas.January 18, 2021 9:04 amExtra checks to prevent repeat of 6 January attack on CapitolJanuary 19, 2021 8:36 am- Advertisement -TOP NEWSNewsA train driver in the Netherlands has been saved by a...NewsA pledge to hit 500,000 coronavirus tests a day in the...NewsDr Waqainabete says the vessel remains under quarantine in Fiji Waters.- Advertisement -NZ Fiji Times is your news, entertainment, music fashion website.
