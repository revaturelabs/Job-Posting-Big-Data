As a parent, I may need to leave for part of the day or before 5. Everyone here understands and I don’t feel guilty. Even if I’m not sitting at my desk from 9-5, my work and my teams work will still be done on time. Centro is giving me the opportunity to live the best life I can.Matt KlaersManager, Financial ReportingHow do you empower your team to be more creative?There’s an incredible balance of freedom, drive, and fun that I’ve only experienced at Centro. On an engineering team retreat this summer, the plan was to code from 10 AM – 2 PM on a fun team-based competition and then go outside to enjoy the day. The team would not stop coding until 10 PM! Of course, this was followed by 6 hours of karaoke.MikeVP, software engineeringWhat are Centro Perks + BenefitsCentro Benefits OverviewWhile our people work to change an industry, we reward them with industry-leading perks.
