That was up from about 767,400 in the second half of September, or a jobless rate of 19.1%.Haaretz podcast: If Biden wins, Trump transition could prove very significant for Netanyahu0:00-- : --15Skip 15 seconds backwardsPlay audio15Skip 15 seconds ahead1XChange playback rate from 1 to 1Mute audioThe biggest increase in the rate was for those on unpaid leave, whose numbers jumped to 627,400 in first-half October from 507,400 in second-half September.The rise tracks Israel’s entry in a second lockdown, which began September 18 and tightened further a week later, as well as the High Holy Days period that traditionally sees a slowdown of economic activity. On the eve of the second lockdown in early September, the broad rate had fallen to as low as 11.5%.Although many restrictions that have impacted sectors such as retail and tourism remain in effect, the second lockdown mostly ended as of October 18 and is expected to bring a further lowering of the jobless rate.Coronavirus has killed economic ideology.

Nevertheless, the first-half October rate was the lowest since the second half of May, bureau figures showed.The third category of unemployed that comprises people who lost their jobs before the onset of the pandemic last March but are not looking for work due to the crisis, numbered 104,900 in first-half October. It was up from 95,000 in late September and the highest level since the second half of May, bureau figures showed.In their latest economic outlook, issued last month, Bank of Israel economists said that in their best-case forecast the unemployment rate would fall to 16.7% on average in the fourth (current) quarter, then fall gradually to 7.8% by the end of 2021. Their worst-case estimate is that the rate will average 20.2% in the fourth quarter and remain at an elevated 13.9% as late as the end of 2021.Tags:CoronavirusIsrael economyCommentsIn the NewsIn the NewsCOVIDAirport shutPfizerDan GertlerIron Dome - GulfLeiferUganda JewsUgandan Jews Not Eligible to Immigrate to Israel, State Informs High CourtWhat Medical Data Is Israel Sharing With Pfizer - and Is It Protected?Why Biden Must Not Boycott HamasApple TV’s New Israeli Thriller ‘Losing Alice’ Is the anti-‘Fauda’How an Ongoing COVID State of Emergency Will Benefit NetanyahuAfrica Searches for Israeli InnovationPromoted contenthaaretzFacebookTwitterAndroidAppleEmailRSSSubscribeNewslettersTermsContact UsFAQAdvertiseDownload App© Haaretz Daily Newspaper Ltd.
