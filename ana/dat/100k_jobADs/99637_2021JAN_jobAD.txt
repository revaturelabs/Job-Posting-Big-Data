Some confidential company information can be so important that if your competitors got hold of it, your company could suffer very serious financial losses.每家公司都有秘密。公司里有些机密信息是很重要的，如果你的竞争对手得到这些信息，你的公司就可能会遭受到很严重的经济损失。Some types of secrets include financial information, details about your company's products, secret information about how your company makes products (like Coke and KFC) and future business plans.一些类型的秘密包括财务信息，公司产品的细节，有关公司如何生产产品的机密信息(如可口可乐与肯德鸡)以及未来的商务计划。Some companies don't pay close attention to protecting their secrets. Often they don't think that anyone would want to steal their secrets or they fail to realize the value of their own information.有些公司不注意保护他们的机密。通常他们认为不会有人想偷窃他们的秘密，或者他们意识不到他们自己信息的价值。Every year, many companies lose millions (and sometimes billions) of dollars due to corporate spies. Corporate spies are highly trained to specific target and obtain information from one company for sale to another company.每一年，很多公司由于公司间谍而损失数百万(有时数十亿)美元。公司间谍受过高水平的训练，专门瞄准并获取一家公司的信息，然后把它卖给另一家公司。Protecting your company information can be very simple. Make sure that all your employees understand why there is a need to protect data, use secure and reliable email and Internet software, lock draws and cabinets and shred any important documents before throwing them away.保护公司信息其实很简单。确保你的所有雇员明白为什么需要保护资料、使用值得信赖的电子邮件以及网络软件、锁上抽屉和柜子、丢弃任何重要文件之前要先切碎。Safely protecting company secrets is the responsibility of every employee. You expect your company to be able to pay you on time - something that they might not be able to do if they keep losing all of their valuable data to their competitors.安全地保护公司的秘密是每一个员工的职责。你期望公司能够按时支付你薪水-如果他们老是丢失所有有价值的资料而让竞争对手得到的话，他们就可能无法这么做。上一篇：职场英语应聘者面试注意事项 下一篇：职场英语会议如何总结发言[职场英语]相关推荐CN人才网反馈"
