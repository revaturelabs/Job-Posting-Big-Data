Does this cocktail get the green light with your current diet?Click here for Nutritional Facts.Strawberry BashIf you donâ€™t like strawberries, this is definitely not for you. This is a beautiful, sweet spring or summer cocktail to enjoy with friends or loved ones for brunch or you can simply treat yourself to a nice cocktail and R&R.Recipe PinPicture Perfect Strawberry Moments1BrunchThe fruity cocktail is a brunch staple, and it is a fact that sweet cocktails pair well with savory dishes, which brunches are always full of. The ease of having premixed cocktails on hand is in the prep â€“ there hardly is any. You simply shake the can up; pour it over ice in a nice glass and pop a mint sprig on top and a strawberry on the rim and you have a brunch-approved cocktail.2A Night CapLetâ€™s be honest; you have never and will never get the vibe that your date wants you to feed them strawberries. Donâ€™t do that. And, if youâ€™ve attempted it, how creepy and â€˜90s of you. Instead, opt for a nice, fruity cocktail that allows you two to have some good conversation and see where things progress.3Spicy MealsAcidic and sweet drinks help tame the harshness of super spicy foods. So, if you know youâ€™re being challenged to eat something insanely hot like ghost pepper wings, you might want to give this cocktail a try. To be on the safe side, you might want to add some more sugar and some lime to cut the heat even further.4A Bland MealThereâ€™s nothing sadder than food with no flavor. You have to get it from somewhere. Why not pair your seasonless, boiled chicken with a fun cocktail to get you through the meal?Buzzballz NationThereâ€™s something for everyone.
