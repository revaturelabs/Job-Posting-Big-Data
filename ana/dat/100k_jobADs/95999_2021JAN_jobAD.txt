This will provide immediate cash flow benefits for small businesses,streamlined business registration processes will make it quicker and simpler to set up a new business. A single online registration site will be developed for business registration including company registration,the Government will remove obstacles to crowd-sourced equity funding to help promote small business access to finance by increasing the availability of innovative sources of funding, andfrom 1 July, expanded tax concessions for Employee Share Schemes will make it easier for small start-up companies to attract and retain the skills and talent they need to grow.These measures will help encourage investment, innovation and the start-up of new businesses, which will help Australia’s economic future.Mr Hogan said the Growing Jobs and Small Business package will also help employers to take on inexperienced and mature workers.In the first eighteen months of the Government, around a quarter of a million new jobs were created – but there is more work to do.“New measures will focus on making job seekers more employable, reducing the costs of taking on new staff, and bringing job seekers and job providers together,” Mr Hogan said.The Government is investing $6.8 billion to establish jobactive to improve the quality of services delivered to job seekers and employers. The new jobactive system will be focused on results and reward performance not process.There will be a $1.2 billion pool for wage subsidies to support employers to provide job opportunities and assist job seekers into work.The Government will also deliver a $331 million Youth Employment Strategy, an $18 million National Work Experience programme, and changes to Restart to make it easier for small businesses to receive Government support when they employ older workers.“The Government’s Growing Jobs and Small Business package will create the right conditions for Australian small businesses to thrive and grow,” Mr Hogan said.Further details on the Government’s Growing Jobs and Small Business package can be found at www.budget.gov.auAuthorised by Kevin Hogan MP, National Party of Australia, Lismore, NSWCategories: Local Issues, Media Releases 15 May 2015Tags: Budget 2015Kevin Hogan MPSmall BusinessPost navigationPreviousPrevious post:Kevin Hogan’s letter to the Northern Star on this years budgetNextNext post:Funding for Literacy and Numeracy Programmes at Jarjum Pre-schoolRelated PostsNew Year brings New PBS listings7 January 2021Expanded PBS access to breakthrough medicine for lung cancer24 December 2020Vale Doug Anthony20 December 2020Extending battery back-up for rural phone towers8 December 2020Christmas comes early for agricultural shows and field days8 December 2020PBS support for Australians living with leukaemia2 December 2020LatestNew Year brings New PBS listings 7 January 2021Expanded PBS access to breakthrough medicine for lung cancer 24 December 2020Vale Doug Anthony 20 December 2020Extending battery back-up for rural phone towers 8 December 2020Christmas comes early for agricultural shows and field days 8 December 2020What’s popular in PageAged care Agriculture Ballina Bridges Budget Bushfire Business Hub Casino Clarence Valley Coalition Coalition Government Community Economy Education Environment Farming Federal Government Federal member for Page Federal Parliament Funding Grafton Grant Grants Health Jobs Kevin Hogan Kevin Hogan MP Kyogle Lismore Lismore City Council Local Sporting Champions Member for Page Mental Health Northern Rivers Pacific Highway Pacific Highway Upgrade Page PBS Richmond Valley Roads Stronger Communities Program Veterans Woolgoolga to Ballina Woolgoolga to Ballina Upgrade YambaContact Kevin Hogan MPLISMORE ELECTORATE OFFICE63 Molesworth St, Lismore, NSW, 2480Phone: (02) 6621 4044Fax: (02) 6621 4255GRAFTON ELECTORATE OFFICE1/83A Prince St, Grafton, NSW, 2460Phone: (02) 6643 3973Freecall: 1300 657 556EMAIL KEVINAuthorised by Kevin Hogan, 63 Molesworth St, Lismore, NSW, 2480DSIS website | Privacy Policy | AccessibilityGo to Top"
