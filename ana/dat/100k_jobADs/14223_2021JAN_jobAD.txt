Anthony has helped me get out of my rut. He got me focused and organized, and has greatly helped me clarify my professional goals and direction. Anthony is a keen listener, and brings an energetic and creative perspective to our discussions. My focus, enthusiasm, and confidence are at an all-time high! I would gladly recommend Anthony to any professional seeking the help and guidance of a career coach.” – William Burr, IV, P.E., Project Manager, Maser Consulting, Hamilton, New Jersey“Over the past four years, Anthony provided me with invaluable information regarding my professional development as an engineer. Anthony greatly assisted me with the application process for the PE exam to ensure my admittance to the exam at a young age. He provided assistance with preparation and study strategies for taking the PE exam; I passed the exam on my first attempt. Anthony also inspired me to become involved with professional societies. I am now on the Board of Director’s for both the Rockland County Chapter and Professional Engineers in Construction (PEC) for the New York State Society of Professional Engineers. My career would not be where it is today without Anthony’s guidance in my professional development. I would recommend to all engineers and project managers out there to seek Anthony’s guidance!” – Peter Helseth, Civil Engineer, The Shaw Group, New York, New York“I felt unappreciated by the company I work for and that feeling was affecting my job satisfaction and home life. An opportunity was presented to me to receive professional coaching from Anthony. I jumped at the opportunity with the ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ attitude. In the first coaching session, when Anthony and I discussed positive and negative energy, I knew this coaching could be beneficial to me. Anthony immediately got to the core of my negative energy and we spent the next many sessions working on how to deal with and minimize that negative energy. At the completion of the coaching, I felt a great awareness of negative energy in my work and personal life and also learned how to deal with that negative energy thanks to Anthony’s coaching. I feel much more appreciated at work and I received the promotion I was striving for.” – Project Manager, Reputable Engineering Firm, New York\"Anthony may be my first professional coach, but his energy is contagious and his insights are invaluable. He has the remarkable ability to see to the heart of an issue and to visualize a path to opportunity. I’m finding my way to success – with a little luck, and a coach.\" – Andy Kubiak, LSIT, Graduate Research Assistant at University of New Brunswick, CanadaWhat are 5 strengths you have as a coach?Inspirational - The ability to help clients realize what they are really looking for in their career and life, and then inspire them to create a plan to achieve it. Many engineers think that they have to follow a certain ‘standard’ career path. However, I help my clients realize that they can take their engineering career to any level of success they may desire!Connection – I create a strong connection with the engineers that I coach because I am an engineer myself, and often times have experienced many of the same challenges that my clients are faced with.Credentials – Having a rare but powerful combination of a Professional Engineering License and Associate Certified Coach credential coupled with the hours and hours of professional coaching training gives me a distinctive edge with my clients. I bring to the table a very rare skill set and experience combination that gives my clients a multi-faceted platform to draw from in honing their own career choices.Experience - I became a partner at a very reputable engineering firm at the age of 27. This experience is integral in allowing me to help engineers create there own success regardless of their age or experience level.Persistence – Once my client is clear about their goals and focused on achieving them, I will stop at nothing to help them to attain them as fast as possible!What is your coaching philosophy?My coaching philosophy is very simple: help people determine what their true goals in their career and life are, and then assist them to achieve them. I typically find that my clients either don’t have goals or are chasing ones that aren’t really important to them. Once a person has set goals that are truly in alignment with themselves, their career and life instantly becomes extraordinary. They are more passionate and engaged in everything they do. My goal is not just to help them improve their careers, but to change their life forever!What types of people do you typically coach?Engineers! I typically coach engineers of all ages and experience levels from recent graduates to experienced engineering leaders.What is your professional background?2011: Became a published author of the book entitled Engineer Your Own Success: 7 Key Elements to Creating an Extraordinary Engineering Career2010 to present: founder of Powerful Purpose Associates and the Institute for Engineering Career Development – helping engineers develop their careers2000 – 2010: Engineer and Associate Partner at Maser ConsultingPE license in NY and NJ and Associated Certified CoachGraduate of the Institute for Professional Excellence in CoachingMS in Civil Engineering from Columbia UniversityBS in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Lafayette CollegeHow can clients get started working with you as their coach?Order Online through our secure checkout: Click one of the Add to Cart buttons belowOrder by Phone: Call our ordering department toll free at 888-491-8833You will then be directly contacted by the head of the coaching program to select the right coach for you.Career Coaching ProgramsService What You Get Price Add to CartThree 30-Minute Coaching Sessions The Career Coaching service matches individuals with a personal coach--a confidant, champion, and challenger who will help you:Gain personalized guidance through job transitionsPrepare and navigate through your annual reviewsLeverage your behavioral and professional strengths effectivelyDiagnose reasons for career dissatisfactionLearn how to take action in networking, interviewing, and taking on new opportunitiesWith Career Coaching you can:Learn how your behavioral style affects those you work withBuild a compelling value proposition for a potential employerManage change more effectivelyOvercome hurdles that impede successSustain professional success and maintain balanceGet ongoing support through all phases of your careerMember: $224.00Non Member: $280.00ErrorCloseContinuePowered ByYou do not have JavaScript Enabled on this browser.
