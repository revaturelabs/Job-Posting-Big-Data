Ensure it's addressed to the right company and for a position we recruit for, attention to detail is very important. If you're addressing it to a particular person, make sure you spell their name correctly!”“The interview is about you and a chance for you to create a great first impression. You should arrive at least 15 minutes early on the day of your interview, look smart and presentable, and be enthusiastic!”“Make sure you have a thorough understanding of the role you're applying for and what is expected of you prior to your interview. Remember you can never be too prepared!”Life at Scott DunnReadLatest tweets - @ScottDunnJobsLondon officeRiverbank House1 Putney Bridge ApproachLondonSW6 3JD+44 (0)20 8682 5082How to find usChichester officeMadgwick LaneWesthampnettChichesterPO18 0FB+44 (0)20 8682 5082How to find usFacebookTwitterInstagramCopyright © 2021 Scott Dunn Ltd.
