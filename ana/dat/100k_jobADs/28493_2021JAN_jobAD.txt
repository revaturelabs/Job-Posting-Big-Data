The layoffs will affect varying retail jobs with different parts of the company, including corporate and store positions.The company also will make interest payments for senior notes due in 2015 by issuing more debt rather than paying cash, according to an article by Reuters. The company, which operates luxury department stores, hopes the moves will help save money and further cut costs.According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company is using a “payment-in-kind” option to pay the interest it owes. This allows the company to save cash by deferring interest payments and accruing more debt, which should result in savings of about $15 million per quarter.The company’s Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores that have been open at least one year have seen sales decline by 31 percent. Neiman Marcus, which was acquired by a private equity group in 2005, has $576.3 million in unused borrowing available out of its $600 million revolving credit fund.When compared to last year, the Chicago-Naperville-Joliet area as a whole continued to lose jobs during the last half of 2008.
