This year’s rankings reflect the current size of each MSAs employment. Only one MSA—Modesto, CA—changed size categories moving from “Small” to “Midsized.” In the instances where the analysis refers to changes in ranking order within the size categories, this MSAs changes are reported as if they had been included in their current category in the prior year.2014 Rank Among Medium Cities Area 2014 Weighted INDEX 2013 Nonfarm Emplmt (1000s) Size Mvmnt 2013 Size Ranking1 Boulder, CO 88.7 175.6 0 12 Provo-Orem, UT 87.9 209.3 0 23 Grand Rapids-Wyoming, MI 85.9 410.2 5 84 Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FL 82.0 222.9 35 395 Lafayette, LA 81.9 161.8 1 66 Bakersfield-Delano, CA 79.0 253.7 -1 57 Des Moines-West Des Moines, IA 78.7 340.1 13 208 Boise City-Nampa, ID 78.2 276.5 10 189 McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, TX 76.3 237.9 3 1210 Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, AR-MO 75.8 216.9 -7 311 Savannah, GA 73.4 161.7 14 2512 Baton Rouge, LA 72.9 389.9 -3 913 Greenville-Mauldin-Easley, SC 71.2 316.4 22 3514 Fresno, CA 70.7 310.7 50 6415 Springfield, MO 70.7 202.5 -2 1316 Corpus Christi, TX 70.3 188.7 -12 417 Charleston-North Charleston-Summerville, SC 69.5 310.0 -7 1018 Durham-Chapel Hill, NC 68.6 288.7 -1 1719 Asheville, NC 68.5 176.7 0 1920 North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, FL 68.2 260.4 20 4021 Lincoln, NE 66.5 183.5 1 2222 Ogden-Clearfield, UT 65.7 205.9 -6 1623 Trenton-Ewing, NJ 64.3 249.8 -2 2124 Santa Rosa-Petaluma, CA 63.4 185.5 55 7925 Modesto, CA 63.3 157.6 34 5926 Madison, WI 59.5 360.2 31 5727 El Paso, TX 58.9 289.2 -4 2328 Framingham, MA NECTA Division 58.0 162.3 2 3029 Ann Arbor, MI 57.8 209.6 -15 1430 Stockton, CA 56.7 203.2 31 6131 Lake County-Kenosha County, IL-WI Metropolitan Division 55.9 397.7 38 6932 Tulsa, OK 55.0 436.2 1 3333 Reno-Sparks, NV 54.7 201.1 40 7334 Kansas City, KS 54.6 449.6 -23 1135 Santa Barbara-Santa Maria-Goleta, CA 53.3 172.7 -20 1536 Columbia, SC 52.9 364.5 2 3837 Colorado Springs, CO 52.1 257.3 0 3738 Anchorage, AK 51.8 176.1 -11 2739 Fort Wayne, IN 49.1 212.9 -5 3440 Lansing-East Lansing, MI 48.5 224.4 47 8741 Huntsville, AL 48.1 213.3 29 7042 New Haven, CT NECTA 46.7 277.6 23 6543 Wilmington, DE-MD-NJ Metropolitan Division 46.2 345.1 29 7244 Lexington-Fayette, KY 46.2 258.2 -37 745 Tacoma, WA Metropolitan Division 46.1 278.7 11 5646 Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach, FL 45.3 159.2 13 5947 Knoxville, TN 44.7 335.8 -16 3148 Harrisburg-Carlisle, PA 44.2 329.6 -7 4149 Pensacola-Ferry Pass-Brent, FL 43.1 160.9 3 5250 Green Bay, WI 42.9 170.0 -22 2851 Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, CA 42.8 289.3 4 5552 Canton-Massillon, OH 42.6 170.3 -28 2453 Lakeland-Winter Haven, FL 42.2 198.9 21 7454 Spokane, WA 42.0 215.0 -9 4555 Winston-Salem, NC 41.3 209.3 -7 4856 Akron, OH 41.0 330.3 -12 4457 Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown, NY 40.5 254.8 -14 4358 Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, CT NECTA 40.5 413.2 27 8559 Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ 40.0 345.7 -30 2960 Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway, AR 39.0 345.1 -13 4761 Calvert-Charles-Prince George's, MD 38.6 386.4 17 7862 Portland-South Portland-Biddeford, ME NECTA 36.8 193.5 9 7163 Worcester, MA-CT NECTA 36.7 248.9 -3 6064 Toledo, OH 35.6 308.9 13 7765 Lancaster, PA 35.4 231.8 -12 5366 Reading, PA 34.6 170.7 -40 2667 Chattanooga, TN-GA 34.6 238.9 -16 5168 Montgomery, AL 34.0 169.0 8 7669 Evansville, IN-KY 33.1 177.2 -2 6770 Tallahassee, FL 33.0 170.4 12 8271 Tucson, AZ 32.7 366.4 -9 6272 Augusta-Richmond County, GA-SC 32.6 217.4 -14 5873 Wichita, KS 32.6 290.7 17 9074 Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY 32.6 446.4 -38 3675 Greensboro-High Point, NC 32.4 348.7 9 8476 Gary, IN Metropolitan Division 32.4 273.8 -8 6877 Roanoke, VA 31.9 159.1 -27 5078 Jackson, MS 31.8 259.4 -32 4679 Springfield, MA-CT NECTA 31.6 293.3 12 9180 Baltimore City, MD 29.6 359.3 -48 3281 York-Hanover, PA 26.6 177.0 -32 4982 Syracuse, NY 23.7 315.7 -7 7583 Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, OH-PA 23.5 225.1 6 8984 Davenport-Moline-Rock Island, IA-IL 22.4 181.3 -30 5485 Shreveport-Bossier City, LA 22.1 171.5 -4 8186 Peoria, IL 21.8 177.6 -44 4287 Mobile, AL 19.8 172.7 -4 8388 Scranton--Wilkes-Barre, PA 19.4 253.2 -25 6389 Albuquerque, NM 18.6 368.1 -3 8690 Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, FL 17.9 194.7 -10 8091 Beaumont-Port Arthur, TX 17.7 156.9 -25 6692 Dayton, OH 16.4 374.2 -4 88»Email this BestSubjects:Best Cities 2014Subscribe to NG ArticlesSubscribe to Articles feedOr, get articles by email:NewGeography.com is a joint venture of Joel Kotkin and Praxis Strategy GroupFeatured ContentView all subjectsThe Coming of Neo-FeudalismJoel Kotkin's newest book The Coming of Neo-Feudalism: A Warning to the Global Middle Class is now available to order.
