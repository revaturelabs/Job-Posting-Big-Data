Email marketing is commonly regarded as one of the most effective tools for promoting your brand to potential customers, even outperforming other strategies such as social media. Email marketing campaign services exist for a reason, after all.If you’re new to digital marketing, you’re probably shaking your head in disbelief. How can this generation still be into email? Marketers know email is not only alive, but still ever so relevant, easy to use, inexpensive, and most importantly, effective. Here are reasons to invest in creating an email marketing campaign.1. Email Is Not RestrictiveWe’re past the phase of Facebook giving business owners and advertisers a chance to promote their brands, only to take it back after several privacy issues and algorithm changes. Luckily for marketers, Facebook paves one way of advertising online, but it’s not the only possible, or even best, method.This is where email shines. You don’t have to worry about any algorithm changes that could reroute your entire marketing strategy. In fact, you don’t even have to worry about your audience disappearing or moving to the next best platform.Your email list is still a list of people who want to hear from your company. Even if they choose to unsubscribe, emails boast a 20 per cent open rate-that’s higher than a Facebook metric equivalent, “people talking about this”, which stands at 5 per cent.2. Email Stands the Test of Time… Better Than Social MediaSocial media is fast-paced, which means your posts easily become old news in the span of, give or take, two days. Emails can last longer than two days, because people don’t get emails as fast as they consume social media updates, and with that, your emails won’t be phased out as easily.3. Email Marketing Is Easy to Integrate With Other Digital Marketing StrategiesWith emails, you can easily embed your social media accounts or website. You can even encourage your recipients to follow your account on social media through your email newsletter, and even regularly remind them to check your new blog posts.4. Sending Emails Will Help Retain Your CustomersSending emails regularly can increase the chances your existing customers buying from your brand again. In fact, not all your emails have to be sales pitches; emails can actually be a way for you to pitch your brand personality and values, and even encourage engagement with interactive content.A great example: Glossier, a US-based skincare brand, sends their subscribers emails with random content, like a photo of a baby goat to greet their customers a “good day”. Not only is it a great display of brand personality, but a great way to nudge your customers every now and then to remind them of your business.Email marketing is one of the most effective digital marketing strategies. Your first few attempts may not be as successful, but with persistent efforts, your return on investment will skyrocket. Should you need any help with your marketing campaign, there are several email marketing campaign services ready to assist you, and they’re usually just one email away.Source by Donald SmithonShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)RelatedShare Article:email marketing strategyadminSEO|SMM|INTERNET MARKETEROctober 6, 2020The Need for a Gold Coast Digital Marketing AgencyOctober 7, 2020Five Tips to Profit From Forex TradingRelated ArticlesJanuary 17, 2021EMAIL MARKETING STEP BY STEP FOR BEGINNERS | MAILCHIMP TUTORIAL 2020January 16, 2021Insurance Agency Drip Campaigns & Email WorkflowJanuary 13, 2021There’s One Piece Of Affiliate Marketing Software You NeedJanuary 10, 2021How Email Submit CPA Offers Work and How to Avoid Scrubbing ForeverJanuary 10, 2021B2B Email Marketing Campaign: 15 Emails in 15 Minutes: A Crash CourseTag CloudDigital Marketing Email Marketing Online Business TechCategoriesDigital Marketing 261Email Marketing 144Online Business 149Tech 103Recent postsJanuary 17, 2021EMAIL MARKETING STEP BY STEP FOR BEGINNERS | MAILCHIMP TUTORIAL 2020January 16, 2021Insurance Agency Drip Campaigns & Email WorkflowJanuary 16, 2021Digital Marketing, a Must TodayTag CloudDigital Marketing Email Marketing Online Business TechRelated ArticlesJanuary 17, 2021EMAIL MARKETING STEP BY STEP FOR BEGINNERS | MAILCHIMP TUTORIAL 2020January 16, 2021Insurance Agency Drip Campaigns & Email WorkflowJanuary 13, 2021There’s One Piece Of Affiliate Marketing Software You NeedJanuary 10, 2021How Email Submit CPA Offers Work and How to Avoid Scrubbing ForeverJanuary 10, 2021B2B Email Marketing Campaign: 15 Emails in 15 Minutes: A Crash CourseTag CloudDigital Marketing Email Marketing Online Business TechCategoriesDigital Marketing 261Email Marketing 144Online Business 149Tech 103©makemoneyfromhomejobsAddurl.nuGo to mobile version	EnglishWe would like to show you notifications for the latest news and updates.DismissAllow"
