And I’m talking about doing the little things. Rondo is all that and a bag of chips. You’ve got a guy that’s going to speak behind his words. Even if you don’t like the message, the message isn’t as popular but it’s the right thing to do, Rondo’s going to do it.”Lonzo has not had a veteran of Rondo’s stature or success in the same locker room as his thus far in his short NBA career. In his 12-year-career, Rondo has won an NBA championship (ironically against the Lakers in 2008), made the All-Star team four times and has been named to an NBA All-Defensive team four times.It’s for that reason Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka said that the two point guards will be fighting for the starting position this summer, but Hollins instead focused on how Rondo’s presence will push Ball’s development, regardless of who is starting.“They’re making this deal out of [Ball] starting or Rondo starting,” Hollins said. “He wants to mentor Lonzo. He wants to teach Lonzo. I’ve also played with stars who aren’t willing to teach a younger guy, aren’t willing to share some of the secrets. Rajon Rondo, as soon as I joined the Boston Celtics … he made it a point for me to get the basketball. He made it a point for me to play well. He made it a point to give me expectations of a guy that you can say wasn’t going to play a lot of minutes or wasn’t going to be leaned upon, but he saw the importance of every single member of the team being locked in and ready to play. By far one of my funnest [sic] and best teammates I’ll ever be around.”Hollins clearly holds Rondo in a well-respected light for the dedication and effort that he has seen him put into his and his team’s game behind the scenes. The same attributes could be said of James, but Hollins believes Ball’s best will be unleashed if he can just find his comfort zone on the court.“There’s one thing I want to see. It’s not a number, it’s not a stat, it’s not a form on his jump shot. I want to see stress gone. I want to see him relaxed. I want to see him going as a young kid who loves the game of basketball and just go play and be free. I want to see him laughing and smiling after throwing LeBron a lob on the fast break and going through the legs and Ingram on the trail dunk and just smiling and enjoying the game of basketball. That’s what got Lonzo and everybody so excited about his game,” Hollins said.The excitement of Lonzo’s rookie season may have gotten to him, as he did not live up to the ridiculous hype. Unfortunately for Ball, the anticipation for his sophomore campaign is already mounting over topics like the change in his shooting form and the health of his surgically repaired knee. Rondo’s signing certainly adds to the predictive chatter, but Hollins wants Lonzo to take the next healthy step into his own NBA niche.“I want to see that knee healthy,” Hollins said. “I want to see him flying through the air dunking. I want to see the guy that reminded us so much of Jason Kidd. When I see Lonzo this year…we talk about Showtime Basketball being back, I want to see Lonzo behind that. Then I want to say, ‘Hey man, you worry about being Lonzo Ball, about being the young energy guy’ because guess what? Rajon Rondo can’t do what Lonzo can do. Those are two different types of players.”Aside from James, the Lakers signings this offseason have been met with much criticism. Plenty of confusion about how players like Rondo, Michael Beasley, Lance Stephenson, and JaVale McGee will be used ensued, but it seems the addition of high-IQ and experienced veterans like Rondo and James to a resurging franchise could end up being the developmental push that the young players need in order to make a splash come April.Share this article	share	tweet	text	email	link	on Facebook	on Twitter	via text message	on LinkedIn	via email	https://lonzowire.usatoday.com/2018/09/06/la-lakers-news-rajon-rondo-lonzo-ball-starting-job-mentor-ryan-hollins/	Like this article?Sign up for the Lonzo Wire newsletter to get our top stories in your inbox every morningEmailSign me up	View all newsletters	More StoriesReport: New Orleans Pelicans receiving calls on Lonzo Ball, open to tradeJacob RudeSeptember 6, 2018After a slow start to the season, the New Orleans Pelicans have been receiving trade calls on Lonzo Ball and appear open to a trade, The Athletic's Shams Charania reports.

In their first game in six days, the Hornets struggled all game with turnovers and rustiness against the Bulls. Ball's struggles were most noticeable.For the second time in three games, Ball turned the ball over five times.
