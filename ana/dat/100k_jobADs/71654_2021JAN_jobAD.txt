Most of the recently unemployed won’t be buying new phones.“If big markets remain weak in the fall and unemployment is high, [Apple] certainly is going to see weaker demand for a most likely thousand dollar plus phone,” Purk said.He said that this is still speculation and it is hard to determine what the economic environment could look like in the fall, and if things start picking up and restoring itself then Apple might be safe.“If the current case curves, and follow say South Korea, we could be back to normal and sales could be okay. It could probably still be impacted a little bit,” Purk said.He added that customers in need of a new phone will most likely buy down.“Usually when Apple launches a new flagship phone, they have their previous models or lower models at a lower price point,” he said. “I think that’s where you would see more activity as customers looking to save some money but still want a new phone.”Typically, Apple will launch new products in September, but the tech giant has not indicated whether or not the event will continue.Daniel Howley, Yahoo Finance technology editor, said that the company may still have an event and give customers a preview of what will be launched, but won’t launch the phone until later.Gene Munster, an analyst at Loup Ventures, said in an interview that the upcoming release of Apple’s 5G-enabled iPhone will be foundational to the tech giant for the next five years.“I believe Apple will announce the phone this year, but there may be conditions around the release that is unique in terms of production or availability initially,” he said.Story continuesMunster noted that Apple will be hit in the market but will be “less negatively impacted than the overall market.”“Their products are more expensive than most products and when people lose their jobs the demand in the near term will be negatively impacted,” he said.“Eventually they’re going to come back, and eventually Apple will win customers over as 5G customers. The 5G rollout will be slower than people think, 2021 is not going to be the nirvana year for 5G, it’s probably going to be 2022 or 2023.”Apple expected to re-open retail stores in AprilThe tech giant recently indicated in an internal memo that it was planning to re-open its stores outside of Mainland China as early as April, as reported first by Bloomberg.Purk said that even if stores open, it doesn’t mean people will come and shop.“That’s what we are seeing in China right now. All their stores are open there, but foot traffic is still low. There is still a concern about the virus,” he said.While Purk noted that Apple has a seamless online shopping experience, it is not the biggest driver of overall sales growth.Munster said that about eight per cent of total revenue comes through retail sales, and right now with stores shut Apple is taking about a one per cent revenue hit, just under US$3 billion.“The reality is that when people go in store, they tend to have a higher conversion, higher tie over with other products, in other words, I could have had [the] intention of going in and buying an iPhone and I end up buying an iPhone and AirPods. When I’m buying online, it’s less likely that I walk out with two products,” he said.Download the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android and sign up for the Yahoo Finance Canada Weekly Brief.TRENDINGFit To Post SportsSingapore #Fitspo of the Week: Ethel LinFit To Post Sports·7-min readYahoo News SingaporeCOVID-19: 30 new cases in Singapore, police force admin officer and family member infectedYahoo News Singapore·4-min readSouth China Morning PostChinese border troops likely to benefit from new rules to end unfair treatmentSouth China Morning Post·4-min readAFP NewsMessi sees red as Bilbao stun Barca to win Spanish Super CupAFP News·4-min readAFP NewsHumbled Trump seeks warmer welcome in FloridaAFP News·4-min readLatest storiesYahoo News SingaporeCOVID-19: 30 new cases in Singapore, police force admin officer and family member infectedMOH has confirmed the detection of 30 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore as of noon on Sunday (17 January).a day agoSouth China Morning PostChinese border troops likely to benefit from new rules to end unfair treatmentChina is expected to send more resources to troops stationed in remote border areas, including those engaged in the current stand-off with India in the Himalayas, following an overhaul of the People’s Liberation Army’s rules on how officers are treated.A commentary published on Sunday by PLA Daily, the mouthpiece of China’s military, said the new regulations were aimed at maintaining officers’ “basic living benefits” and establishing a better management system for career development.President Xi Jinping, who also chairs the all-powerful Central Military Commission, introduced the “Provisional Regulations on the Movement of Active Military Officers” on the first day of this year, along with a series of related rules covering areas such as selection, training and promotion.Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China.Military observers said the reforms might help eliminate long-standing problems that meant officers stationed in certain areas, such as the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, were given more favourable treatment and better equipment compared with those in remote parts of the country.“There are some unfair traditions and discriminatory legacies left over from political struggles in previous decades,” Macau-based military observer Antony Wong Tong said, referring to the different treatment officials and officers in the Central, Eastern and Southeast military areas had received.For example, some officers with close connections with top leaders get promoted more quickly than their peers stationed in the remote and tough areas in the Himalayas, Wong added.“Indeed, before the outbreak of the months-long border stand-off between China and India, weapon systems deployed to the 77th Army Group in the Western Theatre Command were inferior to those given to the 72nd Army Group in the Eastern Theatre Command, which is responsible for Taiwan Strait security,” Wong said.“It’s just because the Huzhou-based 72nd Army Group in Zhejiang province has close links with Xi, while many officials in the 77th Army Groups were promoted by Xi’s political enemies Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou.” China’s big military ship building spree to guard its aircraft carriersGuo and Xu, both former vice-chairmen of the Central Military Commission, became the most senior military officials brought down by Xi’s sweeping anti-corruption campaign.Guo received a life sentence in 2016, while Xu died in custody in 2015 while under investigation.Weapons in the Western Theatre Command have been upgraded as tensions with India rose following a deadly clash between the two sides in the Galwan Valley in June. Both sides have also increased the number of troops stationed along their disputed frontier after the incident, which left 20 Indian soldiers dead and caused an unknown number of PLA casualties.Besides replacing the J-7 fighters in the region with more advanced J-16s, other advanced weapons – including J-20 stealth fighters, H-20 helicopters, drones and rockets – have undergone high-altitude tests, suggesting they have been earmarked for the Western Theatre Command.Recent footage aired by the state broadcaster China Central Television also showed that troops in the Tibetan military region had been equipped with the latest camouflage uniforms known as the “Starry Sky” pattern.The PLA commentary said the new regulations were designed to build a system that guaranteed hardworking and responsible officers on the front line were treated fairly to ensure the army could attract and retain high-quality troops.“Under the new provisional regulations that directly link with officers’ promotion and treatment, assessment standards will more focus on combat-forces and troops stationed in tough and remote border areas,” the commentary wrote. Xi Jinping orders China’s military to be ready for war ‘at any second’A military source close to the PLA said the military, which now numbers around two million troops, has been fighting a brain drain for more than four decades.“The implementation of the new regulations is a good effort, because political loyalty tests, personal background and connections are still the most important elements for military officers to get promotion, not just their talents,” said the source, who requested anonymity.The source also stressed that the Communist Party’s rule that the “party commands the gun” still applied, adding: “That’s why the CMC needs to introduce more than 10 relevant rules and specific implementation details for the new regulations.”More from South China Morning Post: * China pulls 10,000 troops from India border, source says * High altitudes send soldiers off course in China-India border region: experts * China and India dig in at Himalayan border, with an eye on Washington * India returns Chinese soldier who strayed across disputed border * China-India border dispute: PLA ‘has built frontline observation post’This article Chinese border troops likely to benefit from new rules to end unfair treatment first appeared on South China Morning PostFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021.a day agoAFP NewsFauci says Biden goal of 100 million doses in 100 days 'can be done'Joe Biden's goal of seeing 100 million doses of coronavirus vaccine injected within his first 100 days in office is \"absolutely\" achievable, top US scientist Anthony Fauci said Sunday, days before he is to become the new president's chief advisor on Covid-19.22 hours agoAFP NewsMessi sees red as Bilbao stun Barca to win Spanish Super CupLionel Messi was sent off for the first time playing for Barcelona as Athletic Bilbao stunned the Catalans to win the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday, a dramatic final finishing 3-2 after extra-time.20 hours agoYahoo News SingaporeEx-director at statutory board jailed 6 weeks for molesting subordinateA 67-year-old former statutory board director was on Monday (18 January) jailed for six weeks for molesting a subordinate.9 hours agoFit To Post SportsSingapore #Fitspo of the Week: Ethel LinThis series is dedicated to inspirational men and women in Singapore leading healthy and active lifestyles.
