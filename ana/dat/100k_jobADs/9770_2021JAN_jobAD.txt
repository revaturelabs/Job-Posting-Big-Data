It was a pleasure working with your team. I especially appreciate all the work of Tony, our foreman. He took special care not to let the construction overwhelm our lives. He listened and always followed through. Tony paid attention to details, added special touches of his own, was very accessible and always made sure the final decision was ours. I would gladly work with Tony and Leff Construction on any future work to our house.”Lydia & SteveSebastopol...
