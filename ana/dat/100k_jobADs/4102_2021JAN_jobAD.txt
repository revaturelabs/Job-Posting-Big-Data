"Sorry, but being a mother is not the most important job in the world…. – The Great Pudding Club HuntSkip to contentThe Great Pudding Club HuntA blog about infertility and my journey to join the Pudding ClubMenuHomeAbout MeFavourite LinksThe $$ LowdownThe Pudding ClubWhat does it all mean?Sorry, but being a mother is not the most important job in the world….November 12, 2015 November 13, 2015Sorry, but being a mother is not the most important job in the world….Ha! Got you thinking there with that provocative statement….well it certainly got me thinking when I read this opinion article from the Guardian. Catherine Deveny tells us that we should drop the slogan “Being a mother is the toughest job on the earth”.Well Catherine, apparently you would be going against the opinion of 92% of mothers. According to a survey by ‘Parents Magazine’, 92% of mothers agree that being a mother is the toughest job on earth. The other 8% must be rocket scientists and coalminers (well at least according to @JillFilipovic.) And don’t forget the journalists at The Guardian.Why does Catherine tell us we should quit the slogan? Because she believes it encourages mothers to stay socially and financially hobbled, it alienates fathers and discourages other significant relationships between children and adults. Hmmmm, I’d never thought of it like that before.When you really think about it, she is right. In her article she explores what a mother actually is in this context, and argues that the slogan delegitimises the relationship fathers, friends, grandparents, and carers have with children. And what about those single dads out there?“If being a mother were a job there’d be a selection process, pay, holidays, a superior to report to, performance assessments, Friday drinks, and you could resign from your job and get another one because you didn’t like the people you were working with. It’s not a vocation either – being a mother is a relationship.”(That’s my favourite part of the argument!)But is she getting a bit het up about it all? It’s just a saying, a phrase. Surely it doesn’t cause any harm? Who actually cares?Well, when you evaluate it at deeper level it contributes to building up the idea that nothing a woman can achieve in life matters more than having babies.My dear Friends, I am not saying that being a mother (in whatever guise) or even going through motherhood, isn’t tough, it is. I have seen it and it isn’t pretty. I’m looking forward to the challenge AND reward of being a mother someday. But I’m not going to kill myself over this infertility, I’m not going to dig myself into a hole of physical pain and emotional suffering. At some point in the future we may have to make a choice of being childless and I don’t want to feel like I have failed. Chris said this to me in the car yesterday after my HSG test. “It’s not giving up, it’s not failure – it’s a decision”. This slogan “Being a mother is the most important job in the world” will make me feel like I failed and will perpetuate a hole of sadness and depression in me, and I don’t want that. And I also don’t want that for anyone of my friends and family, child-free, now and in the future (or anyone else in the world for a matter of fact). My feelings are pretty much in alignment with Catherine…“If you are using motherhood to assert that you care more about humanity than the next person, if you’re using it as a shorthand to imply that you are a more compassionate and hard-working person than the women and men standing around you, then feel free to get over yourself.”Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...RelatedPosted in: Feelings, Infertility Awareness, NaBloPoMo15 | Tagged: child-free living, infertility, infertility awareness, IVF, Marriage, mother, motherhood, NaBloPoMo15, Opinion article, relationships, The Guardian, unexplained infertility	Post navigationI survived!The uncertain future of the world5 thoughts on “Sorry, but being a mother is not the most important job in the world….”	Surviving Infertility says:November 13, 2015 at 2:08 am	Reply	Great points here, both in the article and by you. I would hate to think I failed too, like u said, especially when we have no control of having the “best job in the world”LikeLiked by 1 personAnamarie says:November 13, 2015 at 3:02 am	Reply	Could not possibly agree more!LikeLiked by 1 personNara says:November 13, 2015 at 7:14 am	Reply	I read this too and I agree! I don’t want to feel it’s my one and only chance at living a worthwhile life. I don’t think it is.LikeLiked by 2 peopleMy Perfect Breakdown says:November 13, 2015 at 2:15 pm	Reply	I refuse to think about our decision to stop trying as failing. And for me, that means I refuse to think of adoption as a last resort or failure (as many people outside of the adoption world imply).LikeLiked by 2 peoplePingback: A voice of the child free family | The Great Pudding Club HuntLeave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (Address never made public)NameWebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
