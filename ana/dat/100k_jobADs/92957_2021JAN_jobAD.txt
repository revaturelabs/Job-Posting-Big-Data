GardnerManagement StudiesResearch output: Contribution to journal › Article › peer-review11 Scopus citationsOverviewFingerprintAbstractPurpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the theoretical relationships between core self-evaluations, perceived job characteristics, and organization-based self-esteem. Design/methodology/approach: A total 236 employees of a large US-based mining company were surveyed using well-established measures of core self-evaluations, perceived job characteristics, and organization-based self-esteem. Findings: Correlation and regression analyses support the hypotheses that core self-evaluations and perceived job characteristics jointly relate to organization-based self-esteem. Research limitations/implications: This is a non-experimental field study and as such inferences about causality are limited. Practical implications: The development of organization-based self-esteem is beneficial to both employers and employees. Managers need to consider both the personality of employees and employees' work experiences in trying to enhance organization-based self-esteem. Originality/value: This is the first study to simultaneously study the relationships of personality and perceived job characteristics with organization-based self-esteem.Original languageEnglish (US)Pages (from-to)392-409Number of pages18JournalInternational Journal of Health Care Quality AssuranceVolume24Issue number5DOIshttps://doi.org/10.1108/02683940910959735StatePublished - Jun 2009KeywordsCompetencesOrganizational analysisOrganizational behaviourSelf esteemAccess10.1108/02683940910959735Link to publication in ScopusLink to citation list in ScopusFingerprint Dive into the research topics of 'Relationships of personality and job characteristics with organization-based self-esteem'.
