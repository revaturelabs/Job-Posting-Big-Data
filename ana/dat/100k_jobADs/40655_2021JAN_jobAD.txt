This … brought together two worlds that I love — making chocolate and helping people in need,” continues Huggins, who lives in Redwood City, Calif., with his wife and three children.His volunteer resume includes many years of service with the nonprofit organization Easter Seals and the Columbia Park Boys & Girls Clubs. In 2002, he was named Volunteer of the Year at the Volunteer Center of San Mateo County.On the business operations side, the San Francisco Chocolate Co. can be expected to benefit from Huggins’ expertise with upscale confectionery products. He plans to upgrade San Francisco Chocolate Co.’s product mix from the current everyday offerings to more premium items.“We’re focusing more on high-end chocolate — single-origin products, more dark items, and hand-crafted chocolate,” says Huggins. Retail clients include Whole Foods. In addition, the chocolate maker will be targeting other upscale grocery chains, department stores and specialty gourmet retailers.San Francisco Chocolate Co.’s current annual sales are in excess of $1 million, and Huggins’ growth agenda calls for a 30 percent to 40 percent increase in 2007.To facilitate that objective, the company will move from its current candy-making facility in Oakland, Calif., to a new, state-of-the art plant located in Richmond, Calif., on the campus of the California Autism Foundation. The campus already is home to a school, the foundation’s administrative office and an adult daycare center.Information on the company’s program of “social entrepre-neurship” is featured on packaging for the confectionery products. “We hope to be the Girl Scout cookies of the candy/chocolate industry,” says Huggins.Names In The NewsThe National Confectioners Association has announced the addition of two new staff members.Jenn Ellek has joined NCA as director of trade communications and marketing.
