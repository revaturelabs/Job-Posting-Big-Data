It also does not include any other trade enforcement provisions to protect American jobs. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is the legislative vehicle that grants the President fast track authority to negotiate trade deals.Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Rob Portman (R-OH) offered an amendment to TPA that would have created a clear negotiating objective directing the Administration to make sure that every trade agreement includes strong, enforceable currency manipulation language.\"Tonight's vote is a massive blow to workers and businesses across the country,\" said Stabenow. \"American workers and businesses can compete with anyone when the playing field is level. I am deeply disappointed that this fast track bill doesn't include any trade enforcement language and instead threatens jobs in Michigan.\"Trade Promotion Authority legislation passed the Senate by a vote of 62-37 and will now advance to the House of Representatives for consideration.Next Article Previous ArticleLatest News01/20/21 Senator Debbie Stabenow on the Inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris01/19/21 Peters, Stabenow Announce $2.5 Million Federal Grant to Address Rural Hospital Staffing Shortages in Michigan01/19/21 Senator Stabenow Nominates 21 Michigan Students from Southeast Michigan to Military Academies01/19/21 Senator Stabenow Nominates 2 Michigan Students from Upper Peninsula to Military Academies01/19/21 Senator Stabenow Nominates 3 Michigan Students from Mid-Michigan to Military AcademiesOffice LocationsOffice LocationsSelect an Office BelowMid-MichiganSoutheast MichiganWest MichiganFlint/Saginaw BayUpper PeninsulaNorthern MichiganWashington, DCUpper Peninsula Office1901 W.
