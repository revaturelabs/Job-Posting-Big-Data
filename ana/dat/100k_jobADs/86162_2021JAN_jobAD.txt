They also evaluate when students are ready to sit their license exam.Flying instructors familiarise students with the aeroplane’s controls, systems and emergency procedures, and instruct them on how to ensure that the aeroplane is airworthy. They also teach students to manoeuvre the aeroplane safely on the ground (taxiing), and how to take off and land under various wind and runway conditions.Specialisations include: Helicopter pilot instructorWorking conditionsFlying instructors teach their students in both a classroom setting, and also in the air.
