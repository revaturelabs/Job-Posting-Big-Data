It is a collective voice for students on campus. Larger student governments sometimes contain departments or branches. Seats or positions are offered, sometimes in a range of types.A student government can be a great way to develop communication, problem-solving and leadership skills, as well as an awareness of what's going on in the community. A participant could get the chance to put forward or develop initiatives, highlight and resolve issues, fundraise, or vote on decisions. Governments can range in size and style, but nonetheless are all a great way to get involved in the student community.For more information contact your local school or university.Type of OpportunityExtracurricular ActivityAge RangeN/ACompetitiveness3/5Usually anyone within the school or university can apply, but applications are often carefully considered and so seats may be competitiveParticipation Cost1/5Usually there are little costs involvedMinimum Technical Skill Needed2/5Communication and other leadership skills can be usefulTime Commitment1/5Weekly meetings are commonApplication DeadlineVaries, but typically at the start of the school year or the end of the preceding yearApplication Process IncludesAn application form is typical, but this variesImageYoutube VideoAbout Crimson EducationCrimson helps shape, manage and motivate students with personalised education packages that dramatically improve admission chances for top-tier universities.Tap into our network of 2,300+ tutors, mentors and consultants - students or alumni from the best US and UK universities - that live and breathe the success you aspire to achieve.Contact us here:j.wright@crimsoneducation.orgOpportunity Leader ProfileApply NowShare this opportunity:Email me opportunities like thisHomeContactAbout UsTerms & ConditionsOpportunity LeadersPost an OpportunitySign upSign inStudentsFind OpportunitiesCreate ProfileSign inSocialFacebookInstagramYoutubeOur sitesCrimson EducationAsk CrimsonCrimson HubCrimson Global Academy"
