The annual study looks into the fastest-growing job opportunities in the various markets, reveals the skills associated with the jobs, and indicate what the trends portend for the near future.For Singapore, the top emerging jobs are:AI specialistRobotics engineerFull stack engineerBackend developerData scientistDevOps engineerData engineerCybersecurity specialistCommunity specialistPartnerships specialistClinical specialistE-commerce specialistCustomer success specialistProduct ownerCreative copywriterAs an aspiring Smart Nation, the country’s hot emerging jobs are reflected in AI and Robotics. Roles such as Community specialist and Customer Success specialist indicate that soft skills in customer service are strongly in demand. There is also a trend wherein tech professionals are expected to possess strong soft skills.For the Australia job market, the top 15 are:AI specialistCybersecurity specialistMarketing automation specialistRobotics engineer (software)Site reliability engineerCustomer success specialistData scientistData engineerGrowth managerChief Strategy OfficerAnti Money-Laundering specialistProduct ownerService designerFull Stack engineerAutomation consultantFor the India job market, the top 15 are:Blockchain developerAI specialistJavascript developerRobotic Process Automation (RPA) consultantBack-end developerGrowth managerSite reliability engineerCustomer Success specialistFull Stack engineerRobotics engineer (software)Cybersecurity specialistPython developerDigital Marketing specialistFront-end engineerLead Generation specialistDiscerning the salient regional trendsThe role of Data Scientist, the top emerging job last year, continues to rank high. In fact, the profiles of data scientists received the most views in LinkedIn. Dr Angshuman Ghosh, Senior Manager, Data Science and Strategy, Grab, had invested hundreds of hours to learn new skills in data science when he saw the career trend. “As technology evolves, one has to continuously learn and upgrade to remain relevant and competitive in the fast-changing field of data science.”Another professional who benefited from leveraging a strategic LinkedIn presence is Siew Choo Soh, Managing Director for Consumer Banking and Big Data, DBS Bank. “As a professional in this domain, we must do our part to share our skills and encourage others to take up this discipline to broaden the community of available talent that will help drive the next wave of digital transformation through AI.”Soh was referring to skills in TensorFlow, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Python, RPA, MySQL, MongoDB, Apache Spark, R, AngularJS, Node.js, Reacty.js, Blue Prism, UiPath and Git. A good mix of these skills is needed for the top jobs such as AI specialist, RPA/Robotics/Full Stack engineer, software developers and roles in data science.These trends stretch across Australia, Singapore and India, and mirror many of the top emerging opportunities in the reports for the USA and UK, with the exception of data protection roles in the latter region.According to Feon Ang, VP for LinkedIn’s Talent and Learning Solutions, Asia, even as we see the rise in demand for data and technology expertise and continual learning to adapt and evolve skills to stay relevant, the biggest skills gap is ultimately in the soft skills:“Digitization and automation have opened doors for more jobs that require creativity and interpersonal skills to help make sense of data and technology. We hope that the Emerging Job Report will serve as a useful guide for companies to identify areas that they should be investing in for planning and hiring talents, as well as for reskilling and upskilling existing employees.”BookmarkShare:PreviousInvestors pump US$14 million into start-ups at Techfest Vietnam 2019NextE-Invoicing: Can it increase the tax base in developing Asian economies?Related PostsFrom data warehousing to data lakes – now what?April 8, 2020Managing cloud data – easier said than doneDecember 4, 2020Attention APAC compliance teams: OFAC is watching youAugust 5, 2020Global travel recovery bounces back with a more local focus: studySeptember 9, 2020Leave a reply Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment.Search for:WhitepapersScalable infrastructure that puts you in the lead for AIHere’s the NVIDIA DGX A100 …Download Whitepaper5 ways your software must fit your manufacturing businessHow to select the enterprise …Download WhitepaperGetting comfortable in the cloud10 reasons modern manufacturers thrive …Download WhitepaperUsing NVIDIA Virtual GPUs to power mixed workloadsHow to accelerate your organization’s …Download WhitepaperCase StudiesGPUs power AI services in the 5G eraTo meet growing demand for …Read MoreThe cloud and COVID-19: Pivoting in a crisis to protect livesOne of Asia’s largest healthcare …Read MoreTPBank accelerates transformation to become Vietnam’s leading digital bankTransition to Backbase’s platform has …Read MoreAnswering society’s call: Double-11 Global Shopping FestivalA deep dive into the …Read MoreCopyright © 2021 DigiconAsia All Rights Reserved.Fuel fast growth by utilizing massive amounts of dataSee how an e-commerce outfit with 100,000 products used a cloud-based warehouse to mine complex large data sets for customer insights that boost daily sales.Read More…×Migrating 500 Tb of data from a Legacy Data Warehouse to SnowflakeA cloud data platform enables near real-time campaign analytics, enriches third-party data, and increases the productivity of analytics teams, all while keeping customer data secure and enabling compliance with GDPR and other regulations.
