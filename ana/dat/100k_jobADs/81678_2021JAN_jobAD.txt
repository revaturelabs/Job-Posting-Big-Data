Hough Needs to be Fired from Several JobsDecember 26, 2020 December 27, 2020 Seth Dunn	ERLC, Luther Rice, NOBTS, SBCOn December 16, 2016 the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention (ERLC) published an article entitled ‚ÄúThe Diversity in Our Christmas Story.‚Äù This week, it was reshared via the ERLC Twitter feed. The article was penned by Casey B. Hough, whose Twitter profile lists him as the following:Disciple, Husband of @hanelise, Father, PhD @NOBTS, Lead Pastor @CopperfChurch, Assistant Professor @Luther_Rice, @ERLC Research Fellow, & @CenPasTheo FellowDr. Hough‚Äôs article highlighted the genealogy of Jesus as listed in Matthew and pointed out that Jesus was a ‚ÄúMixed-Race Savior‚Äù. Hough pointed out that several of Jesus‚Äô distant female ancestors (Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba) were not Jewish women but various types of Canaanites. To Hough, this is somehow relevant to the Christmas story and should make us all think long hard about what the incarnation and the gospel can teach us about ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù. To Hough, the color of Jesus‚Äô skin (I‚Äôm no geneticist but I think Canaanites and Hebrews were the same color) should make us consider the importance of ‚Äúseeing color‚Äù in the Kingdom.What race is God???ü§îüôÑ‚Äî üéÑMrs. Merry MaküéÑ (@Deseret_Rat) December 25, 2020Of course, Matthew includes the genealogy of Joseph and Jesus is not a genetic descendant of Joseph. Joseph was the adoptive father of the Lord. Jesus was born of a virgin and conceived by the Holy Spirit. I‚Äôm not a geneticist but I am a theologian. If races do in fact exist, the Holy Spirit doesn‚Äôt have one. I do not know if Mary had mixed race ancestry (anyone descended of David would according to Hough‚Äôs observation). Franky, I don‚Äôt care. She was culturally Jewish, as were Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba.But Ruth said, ‚ÄúDo not urge me to leave you or turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God.Ruth 1:16As interesting as the subjects of genetics and cultural anthropology may be, these are not the subjects upon which I dwell at Christmastime. I dwell upon the incarnation itself. Jesus came to Earth and lived as a man so that he could bear my sin. This enabled me to be adopted into the family of God as his brother. Nothing about genetics brought me into the nation of Israel, it was all the grace of God. Racial differences, especially genetic ones, couldn‚Äôt be further from my mind.This was not the case for Casey B. Hough. He took the opportunity granted to him by the ERLC to publish an article about ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù which claims that scriptures teaches a lesson about the importance of Jesus‚Äô ‚Äúmixed-race‚Äù. That‚Äôs the kind of thing you need a PhD to make up because normal pew-sitters just don‚Äôt manufacturer those kinds of absurdities. Of course, I don‚Äôt want to impugn higher theological education. Hough‚Äôs PhD is from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. I graduated from that institution and I don‚Äôt remember the school teaching me such stupid things. Neither did the school teach me that females could be pastors‚Ä¶and this is where to we get why Casey B. Hough needs to be fired from several jobs.I am a Christian in a third world country (India) where good resources and theologically trained men are not much, but it seems we are sounder than you lot. Although we are still lacking in many ways, we don't want this kind of insanity to be ever transported to us.‚Äî Lun Chiru (@ChiruLun) December 25, 2020Hough has a female discipleship ‚Äúpastor‚Äù and a female kids ‚Äúpastor‚Äù on the leadership team at his church. Yet, the Baptist Faith and Message states:A New Testament church of the Lord Jesus Christ is an autonomous local congregation of baptized believers, associated by covenant in the faith and fellowship of the gospel; observing the two ordinances of Christ, governed by His laws, exercising the gifts, rights, and privileges invested in them by His Word, and seeking to extend the gospel to the ends of the earth. Each congregation operates under the Lordship of Christ through democratic processes. In such a congregation each member is responsible and accountable to Christ as Lord. Its scriptural officers are pastors and deacons. While both men and women are gifted for service in the church, the office of pastor is limited to men as qualified by Scripture.https://bfm.sbc.net/bfm2000/Hough needs to be fired from his church. The Baptist Faith and Message, and, more importantly, the Scriptures are clear that women are not to be pastors. No man who believes and practices otherwise is qualified to lead a church as its pastor. Hough does. So, Copperfield Church should fire him.Hough needs to be fired from the ERLC. It is a Southern Baptist Institution. Hough flouts the official Southern Baptist position on the church. So, the ERLC should fire him.Hough needs to be fired from the faculty of Luther Rich College and Seminary. This is an institution which trains pastors. It‚Äôs doctrinal statement reads, ‚Äù Where consistent with the doctrinal and position statements, Luther Rice is committed to the Baptist Faith and Message.‚Äù Yet, Hough flouts it.How did Hough graduate from a Southern Baptist school, get a job at a Southern Baptist Church, and find employment at a Southern Baptist entity (as well as an independent Baptist Seminary) while outright rejecting the teachings of Scripture and the Baptist Faith and Message?It‚Äôs simple. Few leaders in the Southern Baptist Convention care about doctrinal integrity. More care about numbers, (diverse) money, and power. That‚Äôs how progressives like Hough become employed at the ERLC and publish stupid articles. I think the chances of Hough getting fired from any of the jobs listed above are slim to non. Listen, it‚Äôs not the exception for the ERLC to have stupid stuff like this is, it‚Äôs the rule. I could write a book about how progressive and unrepresentative of Southern Baptists the Convention‚Äôs leadership is. In fact, I did write a book. If you are a Southern Baptist, you pay for unqualified men and women to write dumb articles like the one Hough published‚Ä¶and you are in no position to fire him.As of now, this tweet @ERLC of article by @caseybhough has 489 quote tweets none of which appear positive.That oughtta say something about how & what this article communicated.FACT: The ERLC seems hopelessly outta touch even w/ non-SBCers @SBCExecComm @drmoore #DefundTheERLC https://t.co/nNRnKKjph7‚Äî peter lumpkins (@peter_lumpkins) December 26, 2020You are, however, in a position to fire the ERLC and the Southern Baptist Convention. Don‚Äôt give them another dime through your church‚Ä¶unless of course you like paying for lady ‚Äúpastors‚Äù and ridiculous articles about Jesus‚Äô genetics.*Please note that the preceding is my personal opinion.
