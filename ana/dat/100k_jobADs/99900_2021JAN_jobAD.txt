This can be a result of many factors, including the job not being a good fit, the responsibilities are not ideal to your career goals and more. Even when you do turn down a job, maintaining a professional demeanor is still important. Let's address the best approaches.

This involves helping them embrace new strategies and approaches that allow them to make the positive impact they long for and become the kind of leaders they want to be.

The reality is - and will always be - that people make an assumption of you within the first few seconds you meet.
