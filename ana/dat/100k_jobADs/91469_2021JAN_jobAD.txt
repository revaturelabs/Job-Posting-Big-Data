Hume/S.F. Examiner)Mission Street gets a new paint jobTemporary transit-only lanes are complete. Will faster, less crowded Muni service follow?Carly GrafOct. 12, 2020 6:15 p.m.NewsThe CityTransit-only lanes are in place on Mission Street between 11th and 3rd streets after just a few months of work, making them the first of the four Muni routes approved for temporary bus- and taxi-only lanes to be completed, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency recently announced.The all-day, white paint-striped transit-only lanes are meant to speed up travel times and reduce overcrowding on the 14 Mission and 14R Mission Rapid routes by giving the buses their own traffic-free space to deliver service at higher frequencies.These routes have been “a lifeline for essential trips during the pandemic” by serving transit-dependent residents and workers whose jobs can’t be done from home, the SFMTA said in an announcement last week.According to SFMTA, almost 10 percent of trips on the two bus lines are at or exceeding capacity under new COVID-19 guidelines, which means drivers are having to bypass passengers hoping waiting at stops in order to comply with social distancing protocol.Overcrowding makes essential workers late to their shifts, delays individuals traveling to medical facilities, pharmacies or the grocery store and disproportionately inconveniences those who can’t move around The City in their own car, taxi or ride-share vehicle or other alternate modes of transportation.“Installing temporary emergency transit lanes will keep buses out of traffic so that essential workers and transit dependent San Franciscans do not bear the costs of traffic congestion” the SFMTA website says.To address longstanding concerns over traffic safety along this corridor, the transit lanes were widened in comparison to regular traffic lanes on Mission Street.“Previously, the lanes on Mission Street were too narrow to accommodate traffic and buses, which has contributed to unsafe street conditions and 225 collisions involving transit in the past five years,” the SFMTA website says.Other transit-only lanes will soon be installed for the 19 Polk line on 7th and 8th streets in SoMa as well as for the 43 Masonic and 44 0’Shaughnessy lines along various locations in the Presidio, Masonic, Laguna Honda, Woodside and Bosworth streets.This first group of transit lanes was approved by the SFMTA Board on June 30.The 38 Geary and 38R Geary Rapid were also proposed by the transit agency, and were the subject of a public hearing on September 24. The City Traffic Engineer’s Office will consider it next for approval.According to an SFMTA map, there are an additional three corridors that the agency would like to propose for approval by the SFMTA Board: Lincoln Way, Divisadero and California, Sacramento and Clay streets.Residents are being invited to provide feedback on the efficacy of the lanes through an online survey.SFMTA will also be tracking performance metrics such as travel time and ridership, it says, to help evaluate if the transit-only lanes are achieving their stated goals and whether any part of them should be made permanent.These temporary transit-only lanes are just that: temporary. They’re implemented using easily reversible stenciling and painting techniques, and they must be removed within 120 days after the emergency order is lifted.For them to be made more permanent, the agency would need to go through the regular public process required by state and local laws.Bay Area NewsCoronavirussan francisco newsTransitIf you find our journalism valuable and relevant, please consider joining our Examiner membership program.Find out more at www.sfexaminer.com/join/Previous storySelective admissions for Lowell could be set aside due to COVID-19Next storyActivists urge Feinstein to take actions to stop supreme Court confirmation hearingsJust PostedNew search launched for meth sobering center sitePandemic put project on pause but gave health officials time to plan a better facilitySanctions, visas, and the pandemic: One Iranian student’s bumpy path to SF StateChanging immigration rules and travel restrictions leave some overseas students in limboOutside Lands podcasts delve in to West side’s quirky pastHistory buffs Woody LaBounty and David Gallagher have been sharing fun stories about the Richmond and Sunset since 1998New proposal to partially reopen Twin Peaks to vehicles pleases no oneNeighbors say closure brought crime into residential streets, while advocates seek more open spaceSunset District affordable housing discussion flooded with ‘scare tactics and hysteria’Project would provide 100 units, some of which would be designated for formerly homeless familiesMost ReadStudents denounce ‘rampant, unchecked racism’ at Lowell after slurs flood anti-racism lessonA lesson on anti-racism at Lowell High School on Wednesday was bombarded…DA court filing says office ‘missed’ parolee’s ‘out-of-control spiral’The parolee accused of killing two women with a stolen vehicle was…SFMTA board signs off on changes to scooter permit programCompanies will gete longer permits, but higher stakesFearmongering over high-profile tragedy could undo decades of progress on criminal justiceMisunderstandings about parole system plague debate on fatal hit-and-run caseSF to celebrate Year of the Ox through sculptureSan Francisco plans to install ox sculptures in various locations around The…Court delays start of penalty phase retrial in Scott Peterson caseA judge on Thursday continued until April a status hearing in the…New proposal to partially reopen Twin Peaks to vehicles pleases no oneNeighbors say closure brought crime into residential streets, while advocates seek more open spaceBREAKING NEWSSAN FRANCISCO NEWSBAY AREA NEWSTHE CITYOBITUARIESSPORTSPHOTO GALLERIESOPINIONFEATURESARTS & ENTERTAINMENTNATION & WORLDSPONSOREDCONTACTREAL ESTATENEWS VAULTSAN FRANCISCO MEDIA COMPANYSF WeeklySF EvergreenReal Estate©2021, The San Francisco Examiner and SFMCPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseClose adClose ad"
