The U.S. solar industry employs about 119,000 workers at more than 5,600 companies across every state. Since 2010, the solar industry has created nearly 20,000 new American jobs. Over the last three years, the cost of a solar energy system has dropped by more than 70 percent, helping to give more families and businesses access to affordable, clean energy.Posted in National, Newsletter Blog Post	Post navigationPrevious post: Potawatomi Food Waste to Energy ProjectNext post: Promega’s Green Bio-Manufacturing Building Creates JobsProject SubtopicsProjectsBiogasBiomassBuildings LEED/ Energy StarEnergy EfficiencySolarTransportationUtilities, Micro grids, & InfrastructureWindOtherSite footer contentUniversity logo that links to main university websiteFeedback, questions or accessibility issues: sherrie.gruder@wisc.edu.This site was built using the UW Theme | Privacy Notice | © 2021 Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System."
