regional QueenslandEmploymentWhere all the best jobs are in regional Queenslandby Sophie Elsworth28th Oct 2020 5:26 AMPremium Content Subscriber only01Job hunters are being urged to consider employment opportunities in regional areas as a record number of vacancies are available.Analysis by independent think tank, the Regional Australia Institute, showed based on the latest job vacancy data more than 50,000 jobs were advertised across the country's regions in September.This is a five per cent increase compared to September last year - and an 11 per cent increase on the previous month of August.The Institute's chief executive officer Liz Ritchie said it was a \"very positive sign\" for resilience in regional areas that had been hit hard during the pandemic.Lara Strohfeldt, 32, her husband Matthew Rhodes, 32, and son William, 5, recently relocated from Brisbane to Kleinton, near Toowoomba, and can do their jobs from their new base.\"We've certainly seen across regions that they have the ability to step up and get on with the business of generating employment and think about recovery,\" she said.\"We've known for some time there's consistently jobs available in the regions that are well-paid roles where city dwellers are not aware they are available.\"The opportunity to have a better lifestyle, a bigger home and a backyard to raise your family our family in is very appealing.\"The RAI on Wednesday will launch the Regional Activators Alliance (RAA) - a new body to help create its National Awareness Campaign aimed at driving population to the regions.Latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows the nation's unemployment rate in September was 6.9 per cent but this does not include those receiving JobKeeper payments.There are 900,000 businesses and more than 3.5 million Australians receiving JobKeeper payments.Ms Ritchie said among the industries where jobs are available includes in trades, automotive, engineering, construction and other professions including medicine, allied health, diagnostics, legal and administrative.The couple say moving to regional Queensland has saved them money.Lara Strohfeldt, and her husband Matthew Rhodes, both 32, relocated from Warner on Brisbane's northside to Toowoomba last month taking their jobs with them.Ms Strohfeldt works for a therapy business and Mr Rhodes works in aviation and when COVID-19 hit they realised they could both do roles from their new home base.\"The main reason we moved was being close to family and it's good for our son to grow up around family,\" she said.\"From a financial perspective it's cheaper to live out here, we were able to sell our house in Brisbane for a good price and we were able to buy our house for much less.\"Minister Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business Senator Michaelia Cash said the boost to jobs in regions was due to the Federal Government's economic recovery plan and gradual easing of restrictions across Australia.\"Since May 2020 job advertisements have increased by 77.9 per cent in regional areas, compared with a rise of 50.4 per cent in the capital cities,\" she said.\"The number of Australians back into work has since increased by 446,500 over the last four months.\"Minister Cash said regional areas had been less impacted by COVID-19 than the metropolitan areas because \"businesses do not rely on the critical mass of customers that were forced out of the cities to work from home\".The latest job vacancy data showed 22 of the 32 regions were now showing vacancy levels higher than September
