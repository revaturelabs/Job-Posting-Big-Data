Now, there is a job board that caters to every sector and niche that you can think of – Programmers, Designers, Marketers, HR professionals, you name it. We’re talking about tens of thousands of job boards here. What does this intense competition mean for job boards? It means it’s time to stand out from the rest or be forgotten. Let’s see what it takes for job boards to thrive and grow amidst the present challenges in the market and how automated job feeds can bring in significant change.When the market is saturated, the only way to stand out is to significantly beef up your offerings, both for the recruiters and the job seekers. There’s one great lesson that job boards can learn from Facebook–the reason Facebook turned out to be a massive success is because they managed to get everybody on their platform. When all your friends are on Facebook, there’s literally no point in seeking another social network to connect with your friends. Similarly, job seekers and recruiters need a single job board where they get all or most of the available jobs and candidates.Simply put, if you want to take your job board to the next level, you should be focusing on being a platform with more job listings. Job seekers would love the convenience of finding all relevant jobs in a single place.What job boards should be focusing on nowFocus on a nicheBeating the top job boards like Indeed, Monster and LinkedIn to take their place can be a tough mission. Newer job boards are better off focusing on a specific niche, say jobs for web developers. If you find an untapped niche with great potential, you will find it easier to evade the competition and get noticed. You can also build a geo-specific job board that focuses on particular geography to get an edge in the competition. Some examples of geo-specific job boards are JobSite.co.uk , Eluta.ca and hasjob.co.Get all the jobsRemember that you will have to get all the jobs in one place to actually make an impact. Lack of opportunities will drive job-seekers away from your job board, sooner or later. Manually gathering job listings is not going to help you scale up fast enough. Turning towards automated web data extraction solutions would be your best bet when looking for a way to populate your job board with thousands of job listings.More value-added servicesOffering add-on services is a great way to distinguish yourself from the competition. Now that the job boards market is quite saturated, you will have to come up with features and services that can make the life of recruiters and job seekers easier. You could consider offering domain-based insights from the pool of jobs and job seekers, or the average salary ranges to provide a richer experience to the users.When it comes to marketing, you could also consider using big brand names for advertising your job boards. This easy hack only requires you to advertise jobs from big names in the industry like–jobs at Microsoft, jobs at Uber, jobs at Google and so on. This can help you attract candidates to your job board with minimal effort.Solving the ‘chicken and egg’ problemThe biggest challenge, especially during the beginning stages of a job board, is the chicken and egg problem. This happens because, in order for your job board to attract job seekers, it should have quite a good number of job listings and recruiters wouldn’t post jobs unless you have a sufficient pool of candidates as users. The best way to tackle this issue is to focus on one side first. You will have to focus on getting either more recruiters or candidates first and the other party will follow, eventually. It is recommended to focus on attracting candidates first.To attract candidates to your job board, you need a significant number of relevant job postings on your site.
