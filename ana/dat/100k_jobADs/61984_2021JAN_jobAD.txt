I’ve come across many recruiters, some who just do the basic minimum and some who are not even professional so much as to not inform me when an interview is cancelled until I show up at the company and call them but your consultant was really dedicated, detailed, prompt, always following up and also kind and responsible over the phone. All the best to all the crews at The Recruiter. I am sure to recommend you to my friends if they ever have a need to seek a job.Follow UsContact UsAgensi Pekerjaan The Recruiter Sdn Bhd11-2, Plaza Danau 2, Jalan 4/109F,Taman Danau Desa, Off Jalan Klang Lama,58100 Kuala Lumpur.Tel: 03-2858 6017 (general line)Email: support@therecruiter.com.myBusiness Hours: 9am - 6pm (Mon - Fri)Menu sitesAbout UsBlogJobsEmployersPrivacy PolicyFriend Get FriendCorporate Social Responsibility×LoginLogin with FacebookLogin with LinkedInEmailPasswordRemember MeSign InForgot Password?
