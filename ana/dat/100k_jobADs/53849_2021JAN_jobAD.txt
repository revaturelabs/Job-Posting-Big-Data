The cuts were announced shortly after the college was issued with a financial notice to improve in March.Following constructive talks with UCU, the college has now announced that it will reopen its voluntary redundancy scheme until Friday (25 May). It has also agreed to look at the best ways to redeploy staff at risk of redundancy.UCU regional official, Julie Kelley, said: 'We are pleased the college has listened to members' concerns and agreed to rethink its approach to job cuts. We will continue to engage closely with the college to ensure staff are redeployed where possible, avoid compulsory redundancies and minimise the impact of restructure plans on staff and students.'PrintPrint this pageShareContactsUCU press officeEmail: UCU press officeTel: 020 7756 2596Fax: 020 7756 2501Full details for UCU press officeRelated pagesFE fights backA new wave of action aimed at shifting college employers on pay and fighting to defend jobs.Read more...CommentsPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Site searchTermsStay updatedGet in touchIntranetUCU | University and College Union, Carlow Street, London NW1 7LHTelephone: 020 7756 2500© Copyright UCU | Powered by GOSS iCM"
