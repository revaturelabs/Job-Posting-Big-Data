Jewellery designers must be able to relate well to their clients in order to understand design specifications, as well as master the creative and practical skills needed to make a product.A mixture of creative skills and commercial awareness is vital in designing original pieces of jewellery. The design process is complex and involves a series of stages, each requiring different abilities on the part of the designer.Typical everyday activities for a jewellery designer include mounting (making the framework for the piece), setting (adjusting the frame) and casting (making a decorative detail by pouring molten metal into a mould.) Additional responsibilities include polishing, stamping, electro-plating and wire working.In order to become a successful jewellery designer, you will obviously need to be a creative individual with excellent people skills. A jewellery designer's work involves holding consultations with commissioning clients, discussing a client's range of options and formulating original ideas as well as sketching out ideas to help the client visualise the finished design.Promoting and developing the business is crucial for success as a jewellery designer. Many designers try to boost their reputation by networking and entering competitions as well as consulting with galleries, store buyers and suppliers and researching trends and developments in the fashion industry.If you would like to speak to someone about applying for a jewellery designer job or for a complete list of our nationwide jewellery designer jobs, please get in contact!Search for jewellery designer jobsBack to all retail job typesSearchPositionPositionSearchFor job seekersWith many of the UK's top retailers as clients, we are in the best position to help you in your retail career.
