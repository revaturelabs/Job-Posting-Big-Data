They are very professional, and my situation was a little bit different than most people looking for work and they never stopped trying to find me the right fit. They found the fit for me and I am extremely happy with my position.Job SeekerThey did a great job finding just the right position for me! I had a lot of specific criteria for what I was looking for and they made sure to meet every one of them. I was skeptical they would be able to find anything willing to work around my other career, but they surprised me and found the perfect employment opportunity for me. Thanks again CNE, I wouldn’t have found it without you!Job SeekerI very much appreciated all the time and consideration given to me by CNE!! I would absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for a job!Job SeekerWhen I first went into City & National Employment, I have to admit I was nervous. I had been at my previous job for 5 1/2 years and wasn’t sure I was making the right decision. When I first step foot in there, Nicole was behind the desk with a welcoming smile and pleasant conversation. I completed the application and heard back from them the next day to have an interview with Alex. Alex was SO helpful and so easy to talk to and gave great advice. I went in there to apply for a particular job and by the end of the interview, Alex had referred me to jobs I never thought possible and now I’m working in a private appraisal office and LOVE coming to work every day. I definitely recommend City & National Employment if you just need a push in the right direction. They were very fast, friendly and efficient in my job placement and we still keep in touch.KayleeI had my 120 day review this morning and I just wanted to send a little note to you guys and just say thanks so much for helping me get into this amazing company.

I met with Alex to discuss what I was looking for and she found the perfect job for me. I am now with a company that is not only rewarding and fun, but my co-workers and supervisor are like family. I cannot thank City National Staffing and Alex enough for helping me find a job that I love!Chelle© 2021 City & National Employment | Site Credits Staffing Websites by Haley Marketing | PrivacyCity & National Employment319-232-6641 221 East 4th Street Waterloo, IA 50703PrivacySearch JobsRefer a FriendRequest an EmployeeContact UsHomeJobsOverviewSearch JobsRefer a FriendTestimonialsResume BuilderServicesOverviewTestimonialsRequest an EmployeeSpecialtiesStaffing SpecialtiesEngineering SpecialtiesIT SpecialtiesAbout UsOverviewOur TeamOur StoryBlogContact UsEmployee SurveyClient SurveySubmit a Testimonial"
