Although the two studies' limited sample size and short duration do not permit measurement of mSakhi's effect on community-level health outcomes, these promising data suggest that mobile applications may be an important tool to support ASHAs in improving maternal and newborn health outcomes.Download (English)Publisher: IntraHealth InternationalTopics: digital health maternal, newborn, & child healthProjects: Manthan ProjectexecteamdirectorsRelated ContentDecember 01, 2020In Central America, Health Workers Keep HIV Services Available despite Dual DisastersNovember 17, 2020In Burkina Faso, New Community Health Posts Improve Access to Integrated CareNovember 11, 2020Sanitation Improves, Malnutrition Drops among Women and Children in TajikistanWhat’s NewJanuary 13, 2021South Sudan Provides High-Quality HIV Services to Key Populations—and Sees Positive ResultsDecember 17, 2020Top Global Health Moments of 2020December 14, 20203 Ways Health Workers in Central America Are Delivering HIV Care during a PandemicWhere We WorkSee our interactive mapRead MoreMake a DonationGive the gift of health careRead MoreGet involved.
