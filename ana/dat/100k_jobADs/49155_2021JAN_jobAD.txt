The recent development of ultrafast structured laser pulses, ranging from the femtosecond to the attosecond regime, and presenting custom spin and orbital angular momentum properties has opened new routes to explore ultrafast magnetism on unprecedented timescales.ALF-USAL invites applications for a 3-year Post-Doc position to explore theoretically these new scenarios of ultrafast magnetism driven by structured ultrafast pulses. The position is part of the project ATTOSTRUCTURA, “Structured attosecond pulses for ultrafast nanoscience”, funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 851201), supervised by Dr. Carlos Hernández-García, and with a duration of 5 years starting on March 1st 2020.More InformationAdditional InformationBenefitsDynamic and international working environment.Training and access to a wide range of scientific facilities.Soft skills training.Employment conditions:Full-time employment contract initially limited to three years.Gross salary of 2.750 €/month.Estimated starting date: March 1st 2020.Additional commentsJob ProfileSuccessful candidates will join the ALF-USAL group at Salamanca (Spain), and will have the possibility to consolidate their own independent research lines and to promote collaborative research among the following research lines:Development of theoretical models of high harmonic generation in atomic, molecular and solid systems, towards the generation of structured attosecond pulses with custom angular momentum properties.Development of theoretical simulations of laser-matter interactions in solids, including particle-in-cell (PIC).Development of theoretical codes (DFT, atomistic models, etc.) to describe the interaction of structured laser pulses with antiferromagnetic materials.Implementation of high-performance computing simulations of laser-matter interaction with antiferromagnetic materials.Theoretical study of the generation of skyrmionic structures using structured laser pulses.Theoretical study of the manipulation of magnetic properties of antiferromagnetic materials driven by femtosecond and attosecond timescales.The applicant will collaborate closely with the theoretical team of ALF-USAL (laser.usal.es/alf) and the research group on simulation of magnetic nanostructures (SINAMAG) at the University of Salamanca within the ATTOSTRUCTURA project.ResponsibilitiesTo develop and implement theoretical models of laser-matter interaction along the described research lines.To conduct independent research as well as in collaboration with other members of the group.Co-advise a PhD student and/or Master studentsApplication deadline: February 4th, 2020Interested candidates should send a CV (maximum 5 pages), a personal statement with scientific interests and reasons for applying, copy of passport, copy of title (copy of equivalent title, if applicable), two contacts for recommendation letters, and the attached Annex II, and to Dr. Carlos Hernández-García (carloshergar@usal.es)For further information and inquiries please contact Dr. Carlos Hernández-García (carloshergar@usal.es)RequirementsOffer RequirementsREQUIRED EDUCATION LEVELPhysics: PhD or equivalentChemistry: PhD or equivalentEngineering: PhD or equivalentREQUIRED LANGUAGESENGLISH: ExcellentSpecific RequirementsCandidate RequirementsPh.D. in Physics, Chemistry or related Engineering degree, at the date of recruitment, with experience in theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, Photonics, Magnetism and/or Condensed matter physics.Advanced skills in developing and implementing theoretical simulations of strong field laser-matter interaction, ultrafast magnetism and/or condensed matter physics.Demonstrable team working skills.Advanced level of English.Candidates should be able to demonstrate a promising track record of achievements appropriate to their research field and career stage.
