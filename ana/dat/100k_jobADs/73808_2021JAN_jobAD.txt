Our article covers the jobs available working in a retail shop. With this knowledge, you can choose from one of many positions in this field. We’ll show you what you need to know to stand out among the rest of the applicants.Jobs in a Medical Cannabis DispensaryThe employment possibilities are nearly endless in this industry. No matter what previous work experience you have, there’s bound to be a position for you. Employment options range from entry-level to advanced positions. Keep in mind, advanced positions may need a specific degree. Choose from jobs in cultivation, dispensaries, extraction, cooking, and more.Medical dispensary jobs are some of the most attractive entry-level options. They can be a great career start for aspiring pot workers. Medical dispensaries function in a different way than recreational ones. In a medical shop, the customer is a medical patient. Patients are actively looking for symptomatic relief for a wide range of conditions. You need to know about the medicinal properties of the plant. This will help you excel in this line of work.BudtenderRetail is one of the most popular job sectors of the industry. Many entry-level applicants strive to become budtenders. These are the sales people who provide guidance to patients. Budtenders may need to explain the different products, strains, delivery methods, and product types to patients. It’s up to you to help them find the relief they need.Delivery DriverDelivery drivers are responsible for transporting weed purchases from a store to a patient’s home. You’ll need your own vehicle, a valid driver’s license, and a clean driving record. Drivers must deliver their orders within allotted delivery times. They should always be punctual. Drivers may need to have at least one year of experience as a delivery driver.ReceptionistReceptionists work at the front of the shop. They need excellent customer service skills to interact with patients. Receptionists will greet patients when they come in or call on the phone. They must also educate them about store products, programs, and discounts. Job applicants must be comfortable using point-of-sale systems and other computer programs.Security GuardSecurity guards are essential in all dispensaries. In some stores, applicants may need a valid security guard card, firearm permit, and their own firearm. Guards prevent theft and fraud. They are also in charge of maintaining a secure work environment for employees and patients.Dispensary ManagerWhile managerial positions are not entry-level, these jobs are within reach for the right person. Build up a strong resume working at a dispensary to earn promotions. You can be on your way to become a lead budtender. You can also work your way up to an assistant manager position. Pot shop managers manage all aspects of a store including personnel, customer relations, and inventory.Always be ProfessionalWeed has come a long way from its counter cultural roots. For the most part, the industry has shed its “stoner” stereotype. Today, businesses look for a more presentable image that can appeal to the mainstream. When reaching out to a dispensary, make sure you’re dressed well to make a good first impression. Board shorts and a hoodie may not make the best impression.Don’t Show Up HighWe advise you to not get high before your big interview or when going to work. Even though you’re applying for a pot position, getting high at work is not acceptable. The industry frowns on people who get high on the job, although, there are some exceptions. You want to have a sharp and agile mind to perform your work.Research the CompanyNot all medical dispensaries are built the same. Each has its own company work culture and mission statement. Some shops may serve both recreational and medical users. Others may focus on serving only medical patients. Research the products available at the dispensary you’re applying at and any other unique features.Know Your WeedWeed is a powerful medicine that can relieve many conditions and symptoms. It helps relieve pain, inflammation, anxiety, and so much more. As a dispensary worker, you’ll deal with new users who may be nervous about trying the drug. It’s up to you to know which products can help with which medical conditions. You’ll need to ease their worries about trying pot.Revamp Your Marijuana ResumeMost dispensaries require job applicants to have a high school diploma or a GED. When creating your cannabis resume, don’t forget to include any cannabis education you’ve completed. Include transferable skills acquired from your previous work experience. Also, include a cover letter to give the hiring person a better idea of your personality.Prepare for the Background CheckIf you’re going to be working in a medical dispensary, expect to undergo a background check. Most states require this for aspiring pot employees. State and local laws for this vary, but most prohibit those with a felony record from getting hired. Check to see if you are able to get your record expunged.Research State and Local Marijuana LawsState and local weed laws vary, so it’s important you understand yours. In some states, you may need to complete a class and pass a test to receive a pot worker permit. Knowing these laws shows you which cities and towns allow medical pot dispensaries. If you get the job, staying informed about the laws keeps you state compliant.Get Cannabis Training University CertifiedCannabis training certification is a great addition to your resume. For example, certification can set you apart from someone who has the same work experience as you. Weed training shows initiative, passion, and determination. While there is no national certification course, you can find a comprehensive training course with CTU.Find WorkYou can find dispensary employment in major job search engines or pot-specific ones. Apart from looking on these sites, don’t hesitate to go into dispensaries in person. Ask about open positions and other job-related questions. Ask your network of friends, family, and colleagues about open positions. They may have insider knowledge about an open job.Ace the InterviewMany job interviewees believe the interview is a one-sided street. In fact, it’s up to you to ask insightful questions. Ask about the position, work culture, and other relevant information. If needed, prepare a list of questions you have about the company beforehand. Ask about pay rate, job perks, and other questions about the business.Ongoing Cannabis EducationAs the fastest-growing industry in the nation, it’s up to you to stay informed about the latest developments. You should know the latest in medicine, law, and products. Read up on magazines, blogs, and books. Listen to podcasts. Watch videos and documentaries to learn more about trends. Having this information gives you a better chance at advancing in this line of work.Medical Dispensary CertificationDispensary certification from CTU puts you in the best position to get ahead.
