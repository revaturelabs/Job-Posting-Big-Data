Then Ricardo. The economic sociologist Marx would also then figure. You drop off a cliff after that in terms of thinkers in economics after that. At present there are no deep thinkers in the profession.2 years ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 1 No Jab !Economist75c8A list that does not include Milton Friedman in top 3 is not serious.Arrow, of course. Adam Smith, Arrow, and Keynes would be the top three.2 years ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 2 No Jab !Economistc505Arrow, of course. Adam Smith, Arrow, and Keynes would be the top three.Arrow had SHlT-For-Brains. Smith? Maybe in 1770 when there was no competition.And Keynes?

If I had to include the name of the first great technocrats of economics, I would also say Debreu and Samuelson (maybe even McKenzie), but that's not we are talking about here.2 years ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist08f2I do know more about physics than you, and know where Newton figures in the history of science2 years ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist829bwhy are there so many undergrads around right now?2 years ago # QUOTE 2 Jab 1 No Jab !Economistff74Simsek2 years ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist08f2Says the first year grad student.
