This includes employee stock options, the layout of the Ashley Madison offices and the source code of every programme ever written by the company’s employees. Further, McAfee says statements made by the alleged hackers seem to be hostile towards certain employees, like the company’s VP of information technology, and favourable towards others.And how does McAfee knows the leaker is a woman? It’s all about the insults the hacker has levied. “The more telling was a statement calling men ‘scumbags’,” says McAfee. “I think in any language this would suggest that a woman is speaking.” In addition to that, he notes the hacker’s first manifesto uses the term “spiteful” in reference to joining Ashley Madison after Valentine’s Day. According to McAfee, men have trouble even remembering Valentine’s Day exists, so the attacker must be a woman.Serious legal issues continue to hound McAfee. Belize authorities sought him as a person of interest in a 2012 murder case, causing him to flee to Guatemala, where he was then deported to the US. In early August, 2015, he was arrested in Tennessee on DUI charges and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.McAfee has a great deal of experience in the security world, so his opinions cannot be easily dismissed. His theory about the type of files stolen and the manner in which they were stolen are likely worth closer examination. As such, it seems McAfee’s claims are best filed as plausible, but far from proven. All the evidence is circumstantial or grounded on broad generalisations. Personally, I’ll wait until more evidence makes these same connections before I entertain that they may be true.Follow and connect with us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedinSecurityMySQLMatt SmithJudicial EventJohn McAfeeBelizeAshley MadisonRecommended by ColombiaSponsored StoriesSubscribe to our Newsletters75000+ Industry Leaders read it everydayHow did you hear about us?
