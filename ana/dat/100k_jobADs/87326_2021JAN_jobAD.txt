Windows User Access to SQL-ServerJobMatix uses Windows Authentication security to connect the client program to the SQL-Server service. This means that no password is stored in or seen by the JobTracking program, since the authentication is handled by the Windows network security system (eg NTLM) in conjunction with MSSQL Server security. This relies on the normal Windows user password system and network security. It means that each Windows user for JobTracking must be set-up both in the client Windows system and the Server Windows system with the same user name and password.Also, each such username must be set-up as a valid login for MS-SQL Server (this can be done using JobMatix in admin mode). An exception to this is the group of Admin users on the server system. When the MS-SQL Server service is installed, the Windows local administrator’s logon must be added by default to the SQL Server sysadmin role. (This is a setup option for SQL Server 2005 Express). This is so that Windows administrators on the server will have automatic access to the SQL-Server admin functions (role). Also, in JobMatix, some JobTracking admin functions are reserved to users who have SQL-Server admin rights, i.e. only SQL-Server administrators can perform certain JobTracking admin operations.Edit2. Creating and Setting-up the JobTracking DatabaseThe Jobmatix JobTracking database is hosted by the MS-SQL Server service. The database is not distributed with the JobTracking install package, but is created for the individual business by JobMatix (via the startup page) using a setup form to capture input from the business user and set up details particular to the business. This needs to be done once only to get the database started.a) Start up JobTracking on the machine that is running the SQL Server service. (You need to be logged in to Windows as an administrator or as a user that was in the administrators group when the SQL server service was installed.)b) If this is the first use of Jobmatix on the workstation, then the SQL Login dialog box will be shown. (Only the Server name can be entered, since the user credentials are read-only, and reflect the current Windows logon.) After a successful SQL Server login, the server name is stored in the application directory (local settings) on the local hard drive, so that subsequent JobTracking startups can login automatically.c) After the SQL login, the JobMatix splash screen will appear. In Admin mode, this screen will offer two command buttons (“Create” and “Restore“). (Note: Any existing JobTracking databases on the connected server will be listed in a drop-down combo box, however, for most users, only one such database will be hosted, and so this list will be empty.) Click on Create new Jobs DB to begin setting up the database for your business. The “JobMatix Setup” form will be displayed.d) Enter the details for the business on the first tab of the form.. Most of this is quite straightforward.. However, there are four fields that are tied into the identity of the database and the Licence, and can not be easily changed at a later date. These are: State, Postcode, ABN and the Business “short name”. This “short name” is a short token (max 16 chars) which the user can select as a recognisable short version of the full business name, and which will be used as part of the unique SQL database name which will be created for this JobTracking installation. (The remaining tab panels can be set up later as needed.)e) Click on OK to create when you are sure that all the details are correct. The new database will be created, and a create-log will be written and stored in the current directory (the JobMatix3 install directory, or wherever your user path is currently set at). You should keep this log file as it contains information that will be used for issuing a JobMatix User Licence. Note: that if you create the database with wrong ABN or ShortName then you will need to use SQL Server tools (ie osql.exe or Management Studio or Enterprise Manager) to delete the database, since JobMatix currently does not have this facility.f) The program will exit. When you re-launch Jobmatix (still as Administrator), you should see the new database name in the dropdown combo box. Click on Open, and JobTracking should start up into the main Jobs screen. There will be no jobs to browse at this stage.Edit3. Connecting to the RetailManager databaseJobTracking needs to maintain an active ADO/Jet connection to the “recent.mdb” file that is the current MYOB RetailManager database for the business. The network path from that client to the current RM database is stored in the JobTracking database once it has been determined. However, when a new JobTracking client starts up, there is no path set up, and the user will be presented with a login form to connect to the database. Currently, the caption of the login dialogue box reads “Jet (Access) Database”. The user should browse to the “recent.mdb” file that is the current RetailManager database and complete the dialogue box to set up the connection.The current path to the MYOB database is displayed on the main screen under the label “RetailManager Database”. Note that this path is relative to the client machine, ie. it is the file/network path from that client to the file-server, and it is saved in the JobTracking database for each client that has connected. To change to a different RetailManager database, double-click on the current path, and browse to the desired file.Edit4. Setting up usersApart from SysAdmin users on the SQL Server machine, all other users need to be set up and known across the Windows network. In a local network that is not part of a domain, each user must be set up both on the client machine and the SQL Server machine with the same username/password in both places. This can be done through the normal Windows procedures: Eg for Win-7: Start/Computer/Manage/Local Users and GroupsIn all cases, the Windows user-name must also be known to SQL-Server as a valid login. This can be done through the JobMatix main menu bar: ie. Admin/Users/Add Windows User to SQL JobTracking Logins.Note: The user-name must be entered in domain format ie as domainName\\userName or ServerName\\userName.— Updated: 18-June-2013 10:24am.
