It is old hat for nurses who find themselves working longer hours under less than ideal circumstances. And yet, finding a new job is not as easy as it might sound. Even in the midst of a verifiable shortage, medical facilities are very choosy about who they hire.Perhaps this explains why some nurses might be reluctant to leave an employer they are not so fond of in search of greener pastures elsewhere. RN jobs are out there but finding a better job than one currently has is not a given. It takes work.If you are an RN looking for a fresh start, Health Jobs Nationwide has some suggestions. In addition to the five below, they recommend making good use of online jobs boards.1. Review Your ResumeYour resume represents your first opportunity to make a good impression. The same rule that has applied for the last decade is still in force: hiring managers do not have time to go through multi-page resumes in detail. This is not to say that your resume shouldn’t be that long. Rather, it is to suggest that the first page should highlight those things that are most important to this particular job search.A strong resume highlights strengths, relevant experience, and any specialty care and skills the nurse might possess. Continuing education achievements should also be listed in the summary if they are relevant.2. Target Specific RegionsNurses looking for RN jobs in other states can do themselves a big favor by targeting specific regions. Licensing and continuing education requirements differ state by state, so targeting specific regions will help avoid some of the confusion and chaos that comes with trying to make sure requirements are up to date.3. Research Job DescriptionsIt is not unreasonable to assume nurses looking for a change of pace would consider a different type of work environment. You might have a nurse that has spent the last 20 years providing renal care in a hospital ICU. Now she is thinking of switching to general dialysis. The two work environments are considerably different. Researching what a dialysis nurse’s typical day is like can be a big help during interviews.4. Research Employer FacilitiesHiring managers have certain expectations of the candidates they recruit. Among them is a working knowledge of the facilities themselves. In other words, hiring managers expect job candidates to know a little bit about their facilities before they come in for scheduled interviews. Independent research shows initiative. It also demonstrates that a job candidate knows at least a little bit of what she is getting herself into.In light of that, researching employer facilities is critical to having the necessary confidence at interview time. Candidates should learn as much about a given facility as possible in order to facilitate intelligent conversations with hiring managers.5. Make New ConnectionsFinally, the old adage of knowing the right people holds true in the healthcare arena. Candidates stand a far better chance of landing their dream RN jobs if they know people who can put in a good word or pull a few strings. This suggests taking the time to make new connections in the midst of a job search.RN jobs are out there. That said, hiring managers are very discriminating in who they hire. They want the right balance of experience, knowledge, and temperament. Job seekers offering the right balance are like gold. Those that also approach the job search with confidence are in the driver’s seat.Share0	previous postHow to pick Marketing Sports Bottlesnext postHow can I find top corporate relocation services in Toronto?Brown JoeRelated postsFive Ideas to Heighten Humor and also the Health Wellness Advantages of LaughterBrown Joe April 3, 2019 October 3, 2019Detoxing for Health & Wellness – The Missing KeyBrown Joe March 12, 2019 October 3, 2019Drug Rehab Centers in Lawrenceare The Places to Go for Drug Abuse RecoveryBrown Joe March 26, 2020Recent postsEssential Fire Risk Assessment Steps You Can Conduct In Your HomeBrown Joe December 12, 2020 December 12, 2020December 12, 2020 December 12, 2020 0Guidelines for Money ManagementBrown Joe October 3, 2020 October 23, 2020October 3, 2020 October 23, 2020 0Drug Rehab Centers in Lawrenceare The Places to Go for Drug Abuse RecoveryBrown Joe March 26, 2020March 26, 2020 0Find the Right Place to Buy Coloured Diamonds in SingaporeBrown Joe February 23, 2020 March 5, 2020February 23, 2020 March 5, 2020 0Signs you Need Nutrition SupplementsBrown Joe February 11, 2020 February 11, 2020February 11, 2020 February 11, 2020 0ArchivesJanuary 2021December 2020November 2020October 2020September 2020August 2020July 2020June 2020May 2020April 2020March 2020February 2020January 2020December 2019November 2019October 2019September 2019August 2019July 2019June 2019May 2019April 2019March 2019February 2019January 2019CategoriesAuto (7)Business (19)Education (8)Featured (2)Finance (17)Food (1)Green (1)Health (19)Home (19)Law (6)Music (1)News (6)Pet (4)Real Estate (6)Shopping (12)Sports (4)Tech (10)Travel (8)Editor's picksBasics to Buy a Residential PropertyBrown Joe February 5, 2020 February 6, 2020February 5, 2020 February 6, 2020 0Franchise Finance in Canada – Financing Your Canadian Business PurchaseBrown Joe January 15, 2019 October 3, 2019January 15, 2019 October 3, 2019 0Top PostsRead to Know How You Can Remove Your Floor Carpet in the Best WayBrown Joe January 18, 2021January 18, 2021 0Read to Know How You Can Remove Your Floor Carpet in the...Brown Joe January 18, 2021January 18, 2021 0Some Gambling Tips to enhance chances of winningBrown Joe January 9, 2021 January 9, 2021January 9, 2021 January 9, 2021 0Information about the Online Poker GameBrown Joe January 9, 2021 January 9, 2021January 9, 2021 January 9, 2021 0Reasons Why You Can Trust Online CasinosBrown Joe January 8, 2021January 8, 2021 0Check Out Some of the Best Tourist Locations in NY CityBrown Joe January 7, 2021 January 8, 2021January 7, 2021 January 8, 2021 0Search for:SearchRecent PostsRead to Know How You Can Remove Your Floor Carpet in the Best Way January 18, 2021Read to Know How You Can Remove Your Floor Carpet in the Best Way January 18, 2021Some Gambling Tips to enhance chances of winning January 9, 2021Information about the Online Poker Game January 9, 2021Reasons Why You Can Trust Online Casinos January 8, 2021Check Out Some of the Best Tourist Locations in NY City January 7, 2021Roof Tiles: Building A Beautiful And Stylish Home January 1, 20212021– January (7)Read to Know How You Can Remove Your Floor Carpet in the Best WayRead to Know How You Can Remove Your Floor Carpet in the Best WaySome Gambling Tips to enhance chances of winningInformation about the Online Poker GameReasons Why You Can Trust Online CasinosCheck Out Some of the Best Tourist Locations in NY CityRoof Tiles: Building A Beautiful And Stylish Home2020+ December (9)+ November (3)+ October (7)+ September (6)+ August (9)+ July (10)+ June (1)+ May (1)+ April (6)+ March (5)+ February (11)+ January (8)2019+ December (4)+ November (4)+ October (1)+ September (3)+ August (1)+ July (7)+ June (4)+ May (4)+ April (9)+ March (14)+ February (5)+ January (8)@2019 - Vivito.
