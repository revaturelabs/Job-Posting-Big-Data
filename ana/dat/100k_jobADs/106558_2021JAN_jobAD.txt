If you are in the SU for your preferred location, I would wait it out no questions asked. The border more action and experience for sure, but very very hard to get back to the east coast. If you already waited 6 months you will get it eventually. They obviously anticipated an opening (eventually) or they wouldn't have offered the location. Miami is rarely open and when it does, they take a few people at a time. So, if you haven't applied yet, the sw border is the quickest route to the job. These are just my opinions but you know what's best for you and will make it work.CommentPostCancelLethalForum MemberJoin Date: Jul 2015Posts: 235ShareTweet#5234002-01-2016, 07:55 PMOriginally posted by cbp1363 View PostCurrent CBPO here.

I'm not that far yet, I originally applied for JFK and made it to the VBT (August of last year) but had to reapply because I didn't get through the PFT-1. I've been working out a lot since then but I haven't seen Miami available again.I was considering applying to San Ysidro so that I could go through part of the process and then reapply once Miami is available. I currently live in Miami.Sent from my Nexus 7 using TapatalkLast edited by Lethal; 02-01-2016, 08:01 PM.CommentPostCancelLethalForum MemberJoin Date: Jul 2015Posts: 235ShareTweet#5234102-01-2016, 08:01 PMOriginally posted by cbp1363 View PostCurrent CBPO here.

Sys is the busiest land border but you you can live in San Diego so that's good. Most sw borders aren't close to major cities like that. You will make way more arrests and more law enforcement in sys. JFK from what hear is mostly passenger processing(stamping passports) for years until you can move to a team that's important just a different mission.CommentPostCancelLethalForum MemberJoin Date: Jul 2015Posts: 235ShareTweet#5234302-01-2016, 10:13 PMOriginally posted by cbp1363 View PostMiami opened up last September so if you didn't apply then you could be waiting for a while.

I'll be continuing with my current application process for San Ysidro until Miami or JFK are available. If that doesn't happen then I'll just stick with San Diego.Sent from my SGH-M919N using TapatalkCommentPostCancelLancelotmlForum MemberJoin Date: Jul 2015Posts: 103ShareTweet#5234402-02-2016, 09:27 AMUmm finally finally I had movement on CASS this morning.

I was also told I definitely was failing on my 4th one but still had to go through QC so here I am 3wks later and no word yet. I do still have access to CASS which is a good thing so far.Sent from my SM-G900P using TapatalkCommentPostCancelEagleFist13Forum MemberJoin Date: Oct 2010Posts: 262ShareTweet#5234802-02-2016, 02:54 PMOriginally posted by lilab View PostWell not much info to answer your question but I have taken 4 and on my fourth one she told me I definitely failed and it was the same time frame as the one you took didn't take long at all compared to the other 3 which were apparently inconclusive (my breathing irregular, not enough data ect.).
