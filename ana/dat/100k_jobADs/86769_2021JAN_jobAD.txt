It’s a question all of us have asked, and the book of Job points us toward the answer. Job’s questions are our questions, and we can identify with his frustration, disappointment, and confusion in the midst of trials. In this series, Dr. Derek W.H. Thomas walks us through the book of Job and considers what the Bible says about our darkest moments. He addresses the difficult question of the relationship between God’s sovereignty and the existence of evil, sin, and suffering. In the end, as Dr. Thomas shows, it’s in our trials that we learn to trust God and say with Job, “Blessed be the name of the Lord.”TrailerWatch the First Message FreeMessages in this Teaching SeriesJob, Satan, & GodPain & SufferingThe Dark Night of the SoulMiserable ComfortersContending with GodMy Redeemer LivesThe Wisdom of GodThe Sovereignty of GodOut of the WhirlwindBehemoth & LeviathanRepentance & RestorationThe Patience of JobTestimonialsHas this product helped you?
