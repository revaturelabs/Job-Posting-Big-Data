But a merger would probably lead to job cuts across Europe.PSA, which has worked with GM in Europe since 2012, said it was exploring 'strategic initiatives', but said there was no guarantee an agreement would be reached.A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: 'Speculation is a matter for the companies involved.GM's sale would include both Vauxhall and the Opel brand that's used across other European marketsThe Government remains in close contact with GM as we closely monitor the situation.' Vauxhall was founded in 1857.Its manufacturing plant in Ellesmere Port, in the North West, was opened in 1962 and started making cars two years later.It now produces 47 cars an hour and the Vauxhall Astra and the Vauxhall Corsa are among the best-selling cars in the UK.The talks are the second time PSA and GM have attempted a partnership. The two had an agreement in Europe, which involved GM taking a 7 per cent stake in PSA, but it was unwound in 2013.They have also had their fair share of financial difficulties.Last week GM reported a £206million loss from its European operations last year, for the 16th consecutive year, which brought its losses on the continent since 2000 to more than £12billion.The firm also said it had to raise UK car prices by 2.5 per cent after the EU referendum result.PSA nearly collapsed three years ago, resulting in a £2.5billion state-backed bailout. The French government now owns 14 per cent of it.EDITOR'S DEALS OF THE WEEKCurrent accountCurrent account2% interest for the first 12 monthsNationwide FlexDirect accountEasy access savingInvesting cashbackEarn a market-leading returnDownload Chip to unlock a 1.25% rateCash Isa dealBest buy Isa dealBest buy five-year cash Isa1.10% interest. £1,000 min balanceShare tradingCommission-freeBuy, trade and hold stocksNo dealing fees to buy and sellStockomendationShare tipsFollow top stock pickersJoin for free and get share tip alertsAdvertisementShare or comment on this article:Fears for UK jobs as French owner of Peugeot eyes Vauxhalle-mail239sharesSome links in this article may be affiliate links.
