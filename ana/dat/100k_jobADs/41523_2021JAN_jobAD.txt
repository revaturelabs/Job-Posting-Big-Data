Preparing for each of these steps will give you an advantage over other applicants. The different steps in the Manpower recruitment process are:Online Application: To begin the application process, you will need to select a country from the drop-down menu to view available jobs in your area. From there you will be able to apply and submit any required supporting documentation.Telephone interview: If your application and CV have been matched for the position you have applied to, you will be contacted for phone interviews. Phone interviews are often used to further screen candidates prior to progressing further.Assessment Tests: Depending on the role you are pursuing within the company, you may need to face one or more aptitude test.Assessment Centre: Not every position within the company will require that you participate in an assessment centre. During an assessment centre, applicants will participate together in many group activities, role-playing exercises and additional tests.In-Person Interview: Your in-person interviews will either be held independently or during an assessment centre. The most common interview format is one-on-one, but there may be the possibility of your interview being held with a group or panel.Manpower’s Psychometric TestsWhether you would like to join one of the Manpower internship programmes, or are applying for one of their experienced positions, those PrepPacks™ will give you all the tools you need to succeed.
