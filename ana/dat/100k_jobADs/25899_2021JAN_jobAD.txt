It takes kindness to ourselves and others and courage, to wake up in this world. You must take responsibility and accountability for your life.\"Location: Queens, New YorkHow will clients benefit with you as their coach?Personal coaching supports and guides you in your desire to explore where you are now, determine where you want to be within a given timeframe, and then create a pathway to get there with the understanding that you are being supported in a nonjudgmental manner. My approach to coaching is not traditional. My method offers you a blend of Eastern philosophy and energetic healing that is anchored in a conventional coaching structure. As a student and practitioner of the Shambhala lineage of Buddhist thought I believe that every human being has a fundamental nature of goodness, warmth and intelligence. This nature can be cultivated through meditation, following ancient principles, and it can be further developed in daily life, so that it radiates out to family, friends, community and society. I will guide the sessions, which are typically 60 minutes every other week, by asking questions that are designed to assist you in gaining insight, clarity and raising awareness. My approach to coaching is to view you as whole, competent and capable. My goal, as your coach, is to empower you to access your own innate knowing or wisdom. You are free to accept or decline whatever is suggested. The journey of becoming a fully actualized person means seeing through fear and ego, and waking up to our natural intelligence. It takes kindness to ourselves and others and courage, to wake up in this world. You must take responsibility and accountability for your life. The benefits of coaching are all predicated on how willing you are to work hard to attain the life you envision. The rewards can include:Feeling more comfortable in your own skinIncreasing focus, confidence & self-esteemIncreasing effectiveness and productivityWorking through perceived obstacles and limitationsEnjoying a greater sense of balance, harmony & contentmentWhat results have clients reported after working with you?“After graduating from nursing school last year I was finding it difficult to find a job. Fortunately for me I found Phyllis. Not only did Phyllis go over my resume line by line, she helped me to customize my cover letters to each employer. Phyllis counseled my on interviewing skills and she helped me become clear on what is the best work environment for me. With her help I secured a great job! When I decided to return to school to pursue my Masters degree, I didn't hesitate to call Phyllis. Again she was so helpful. We updated and customized my resume and transformed my letter of intent. As a result I was recently accepted to Regis College FNP program. Rarely am I as happy with services I receive anywhere as I have been with those I have received from Phyllis. I can't recommend her highly enough! -Joshua Wenglin, RN /Westwood, MA“Good knowledge and excellent session.

You also made me feel so good and full of confidence as I waded into the job fair. The best part was how you told me to keep hold of my writing talent.

Rose, President/CEO Eger Lutheran Homes & Services, Inc.\"I hired Phyllis to come help me out with my healing room in my home.

Her energy and creativity was abounding! She also gave me a quick lesson on Feng Shui , so I understood how important the placement of things in a room are. I am happy to say that I had my first client less than two weeks after Phyllis came to my home.
