This is an exciting time to join our team, as we work through a significant period of development and growth.Pulmonary fibrosis refers to a specific group of lung diseases thought to be affecting around 70,000 people in the UK. The nature of these diseases all cause hardening and scarring of the lungs, preventing the transfer of oxygen into the bloodstream. The debilitating nature of these diseases has a devastating impact on quality of life and life expectancy.Pulmonary Fibrosis affects every area of family life. As people become increasingly breathless their need for physical and emotional support becomes greater. Yet there is very little dedicated support available to patients and families. We are determined to change that.Since APF was set up as a charity in 2013 we have established ourselves as a respected and influential charity. We have grown in impact and scale and our agreed Strategic Plan for 2019-2024 sets out our direction for the coming years.Support groups form a key part of this. With 75 PF support groups around the UK, reaching 3,000 people, that’s a great start. Now we’re reaching out to 30,000 people who need one.Patients and families tell us that peer support helps to overcome the fear and isolation that comes with a diagnosis, by providing a warm welcome, information and shared understanding with others who know what they are going through. We are committed to increasing the number and quality of support groups to reach out to more people with PF, particularly through the new challenges and increased risk of isolation brought by Covid-19.The Regional Support Coordinators are pivotal in enabling this. You’ll help support groups to increase their reach and impact, so they confidently attract new members and raise awareness of pulmonary fibrosis in their area. You’ll help to develop new groups and inspire a network of regional volunteers to raise awareness and support. You’ll develop excellent relationships with health professionals and ways to engage, listen and share the views of PF patients and carers, digitally and, post-Covid, face-to-face, to help shape the future of APF, raise awareness and funding, and ensure that everyone’s voice is heard.We are a collaborative, hard-working and fun team, with lots of mutual respect and support to reach our goals. In your role you’ll need to demonstrate care and compassion, flexibility and be solution focused. If you believe you have the experience, skills and qualities we are looking for, we very much look forward to hearing from you!Close DownloadMore about Action for Pulmonary FibrosisAboutAction for Pulmonary FibrosisView profile Visit websiteOur vision, mission and values – drives everything we do.APF’s vision is to find a cure for pulmonary fibrosis s...
