Here are some old proven tips to increase your chances on being hired by an employer substantially through online means: Attaching a Resume When attaching a resume to an email, make sure that the filename for the resume is professional. Don’t attached a resume that is not labeled properly. For example: “documents.doc” sending out a resume or any document for that matter doesn’t relate positive thoughts to an employer. It relates that you are either unorganized or unprofessional – turning them off. Name it like so: “LastnameFirstnameResume.doc”. It is also best to save it as a PDF file so whoever receives it won’t have to worry about document processing software version.

This way, you’ll be notified via email. When you are notified through email, you’ll have more chances to be first in line in application since we tend to check our email more regularly.

Every little advantage you can get sometimes is enough difference to be up the application list.]]>	Primary SidebarTrip advisorLake Norman Brew Ha Ha Tour Sells Out!https://youtu.be/cgMY6qGCM9Y6/5/15 house warming party on Lake Norman, NChttps://youtu.be/AyLTyjFcXFUDestination Charlotte: The BookBuy Now!+1 704-765-5104info@charlottespecialevents.comFooterAbout UsThe Charlotte Special Events Group, drawn from a variety of industries, including hospitality, event management, travel, radio and communications.More About UsConnect with UsAddress: The Charlotte Special Events GroupP.O. 141 kings way drive Mooresville nc 28115Phone: +1 704-765-5104Email: info@charlottespecialevents.comOur NewsletterSubscribe to our newsletter to get the latest updates from our blog.
