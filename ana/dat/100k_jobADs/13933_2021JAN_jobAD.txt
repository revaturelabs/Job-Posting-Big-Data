The excess mortality of Japan is less than zero, therefore, Japanese statistics could be slightly better than those of the other countries. Please figure out the terrible situation of your countries before criticizing Japan1 ( +1 / -0 )AgentXOct. 2, 2020	04:25 pm JST	yeah right , thats why the US President just tested positive for Covid 19.How does that support your.. er.. viewpoints?

As long a one Japanese is without a job, without a home, without hope, Japan won't need foreign labor.
