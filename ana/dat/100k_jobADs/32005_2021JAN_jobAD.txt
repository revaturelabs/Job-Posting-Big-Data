Thankfully, getting out isn’t too hard because your new employer will have you on a probationary period which probably stipulates a short notice period.YouTube.comShould you leave?That’s the question you’ll need to wrestle with because there are lots of upsides to leaving and a few downsides too. This decision is basically a risk versus reward type question. You’re right to be concerned that quitting so early could affect your job seeking prospects but there are other troubling consequences to consider.Consequences of quitting your jobYou will no doubt anger and alienate your boss and your colleagues with this decision. Your boss thought the position was filled and your departure will make him or her have to go back into the endless rounds of interviews that take up so much time. Your colleagues might feel cheated, although these guys can be talked around. The other consequences to consider are that you will have very little chance of working at that organisation ever again. Taking what seems like the easy way out may also set you on a path towards a collection of short term placements.How to quitOkay, so the decision’s been made and you need out. As mentioned before, under most contracts you won’t have to cover a long notice period but you should still do your best to leave with as little fuss as possible. Resign in person, not by Email or over the phone. Explain your reasons for leaving (although you might be best to sugar-coat the reason if your boss is the issue). Offering to stay on until a replacement’s found is a good idea, although most companies will be happy to see the back of you.What then?Check out our guide to unemployment benefits if you quit work.Tags:job,new job,jobs uk,job resignation,sacking,quitting work,On the same subjectWe look for the best sites offering jobs in Walsall part timeTitanic wreckage protected by UK/US agreementFamous people who have suffered with bulimiaSinger bit by a snake on stage and continued to sing for 45 minutesFacts you might not know about Melania TrumpHot Topicsfull time jobsuk jobspart time jobsjobswork onlinecoursesWork from home jobstemp jobsJobs Abroadretail jobsOur themesEntertainmentFashion & BeautyHome & FoodLifestyleTravelMoney & CareerMotoringSocialAll channelsMoneyInsuranceJobsExplore categoriesEmployment NewsFull time jobsPart time jobsJobs AbroadWork onlineCoursesRetail industryFood industryOffice jobsAdmin jobsExcite.ukInfo ExciteWho we arePrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceFeedbackGDPRExcite EuropeExcite ItaliaExcite DeutschlandExcite EspañaExcite FranceExcite NederlandExcite USAStay connected with usFacebookTwitterYoutubeGoogleRssUnited Kingdom - Excite Network Copyright ©1995 - 2021"
