FM Conway also announced apprentice highways maintenance operative, Tony Augustine, as its apprentice of the year.Augustine joined the business in 2015 after completing a pre-employment course at the London Highways Academy of Excellence – a training academy set up by FM Conway in partnership with The Worshipful Company of Paviors to support young people looking to start new careers in the construction industry. He has since become an integral part of FM Conway’s surfacing team, working on a number of high-profile contracts for the company including projects across the Transport for London (TfL) road network.Liz Garvey, head of HR at FM Conway, commented: “The construction and highways industries are facing one of the worst skills shortages in living memory. It is vital that businesses do what they can to attract talented individuals and showcase the opportunities a career in infrastructure can offer for people at every stage of their professional development.“We need a wide-ranging approach to skills development if we are to make an impact and engaging with young people via apprenticeship programmes is a key part of this. A number of FM Conway’s senior employees started their careers as apprentices and we hope this year’s graduates will remain with us for many years to come.”apprentices apprenticeship fm conway recruitPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Most Popular NewsHighways England 'considering findings' of CCTV stopped vehicle trial£300m North West highways framework shares work aroundConcrete roads upgrade launched with £39m frameworkNational Pothole Day survey finds network in declineExclusive: Highways England's active travel claims don't add upStrategic Transport Planner£39,880 – £41,881 per annumThe post holder will be tasked with delivering actions outlined in the key coporate strategies...
