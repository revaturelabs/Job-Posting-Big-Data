In order to encourage Vodafone to expand offshore operations, the Tasmanian government will fork over $850,000 to cover infrastructure costs and provide a perk to new employees by waiving their payroll tax.\"In addition to the direct employment which would flow from this proposal, there will be significant additional benefits from the building and operation of new infrastructure and the flow on effects to the local economy,\" she said. \"This is a vote of confidence in the abilities of local employees to provide the level of service required by Vodafone to meet its customer needs.\"Julie Collins, the federal member for Franklin, the electorate where the Vodafone centre operates, said, “Tasmanians are telling me that they want more job opportunities and more economic activity and that is exactly what we've been able to deliver here.\"While supporting the local economy, Vodafone customers will enjoy the ability to speak with someone locally, among other benefits. \"We've been listening to our customers,\" said Vodafone chief executive officer Bill Morrow.\"Australians want fast, reliable coverage, they want consistent, high quality service, and they want the confidence to use their mobile without worrying about the cost.Overall, the project offers an example of how well-planned partnerships can effectively boost the Tasmanian economy.Premier Lara Giddings said, \"This is great example of state and federal Labor working together with the private sector to grow jobs and opportunities for Tasmanians.”↑MagazineCompaniesFeaturesVideosEventsListsLeadership & StrategyCorporate FinanceTechnologyDigital StrategyHuman CapitalSustainabilityAbout UsContact UsAdvertisePress ReleasesDec 2020Business Chief APACBusiness Chief Magazine is a ‘Digital Community’ for the World's leading C-Level ExecutivesBusiness Chief NABusiness Chief EMEABusiness Chief APACManufacturing GlobalMining GlobalTechnologyHealthcare GlobalCSOFDF WorldSupply Chain DigitalConstruction GlobalEnergy DigitalFinTechCompanyAdvertising with usBizClik Media LimitedBizClik Media Limited is a dynamic and disruptive global digital media company aimed at bringing business and industry executives up to date with the latest news, information and digital reports looking at the technology and digital transformations of the world leading companies and executive decision makers.© 2020 BizClik Media Limited, All Rights Reserved.
