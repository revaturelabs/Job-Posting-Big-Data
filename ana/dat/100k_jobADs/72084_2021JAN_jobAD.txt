Previous project|Next project ?1 of 81 of 8IMAXProvidence, Rhode IslandTo reposition its brand to customers and prospective international development partners, IMAX wanted to develop a prototype design for its theater interiors and communications. The design needed to be scaleable for application to a range of new and existing venues. Gensler’s approach emphasizes a bold, bright, clean and modern aesthetic that connects to both the brand’s heritage and its continuing leadership in entertainment technology — challenging the traditional movie theater experience on every level. Examples include illuminated walls replacing traditional movie posters and large-scale graphics integrated with architectural surfaces that serve as the wayfinding system.ExpertiseMedia ?Related ContentIn The MediaLos Angeles TimesThe Los Angeles Times reports on the new...In The MediaOffice SnapshotsPixar and 22squared make Office Snapshots’ “25 Most...In The MediaGlobeSt.comGlobeSt.com reports on the new Gensler-designed Imax...ProjectThe AXIS, Planet Hollywood...Formerly known as PH LIVE, the newly renovated AXIS at...ShareTwitterFacebookLinkedInEmailContactGensler Fact SheetSite MapNewsletterDiversityTop of page© 2020 Gensler, All Rights Reserved Privacy Statement & Cookie Policy Transparency StatementPlease enable JavaScript to experience the full functionality of www.jobs63.com一本之道高清无码视频_韩国三级电影_香港三级韩国三级日本三级"
