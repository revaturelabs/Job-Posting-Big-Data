The scholarship award covers the full cost of tuition fees for their chosen university course.Since graduating from university, our scholars have gone on to careers in Education, Law, Medicine, Engineering as well as other fields. This has not only enabled them to enter a well paid professional career, but has also raised the aspirations in other young people in their social network to aim high. By delivering the Southwark Scholarship Scheme, we hope to narrow the pay and skills gap between young people who come from financially challenged households compared to young people who come from privileged backgrounds. This supports Southwark’s commitment and vision for a ‘Fairer Future’\"As a council we value our young people and are determined to do our bit to give all of them the best start in life. The Southwark Scholarship Scheme is not only an investment in young people, but a helping hand for a generation that needs to gain the skills and experience to be the workforce of tomorrow. Southwark Scholarships are just one part of our work to build a fairer future for all.\"Councillor Peter John, Leader of the Council“The progress and stories of the young people who otherwise may not have made it to university is truly inspiring – I am so proud that we can continue with this crucial scholarship scheme“.Cllr Jasmine Ali, Cabinet Member for Children, Schools and Adult CareWho can applyWe welcome your application if you're interested in going to university this year and meet all of the eligibility criteria listed below:under 25 years oldmust come from a household with a combined income of less than £25,000 per annumproven record of being a resident of Southwark for a minimum of the past 3 years (students placed outside of the borough temporarily by Southwark’s Housing Department are eligible subject to evidence)have a legal status in the UK with indefinite leave to remainmust be entering higher education for the first time in autumn 2020must have a proven record of active engagement and positively contributing to the community in Southwarkmust have a good record of academic achievementmust have a UCAS offer from their chosen university to start the course in Autumn 2020The scholarship is only awarded to a limited number of students each year.
