Use for skin or hair, as a base for essential oils, massage or diet. You can Google any of these oils to find out the nutrients and properties. These are moisturising, nourishing Antioxidant, and contain Vitamins A, C, D, E and F and Essential fatty Acids; Omega 3, 6 and 9. Information researched on each carrier oil can be found here. Ethically sourced in Australia.I usually choose natural, organic oils and butters which are raw, which means the nutrients are still there in whole. When oils are refined, we can’t be certain how they were processed. Possible methods include heat, solvents and petroleum. The only way precious botanical oils retain all the great qualities is if I process them. This involves cheese cloth and coffee filters which the oil is filtered through twice before being bottled.You can also request the oil you want, as I have most. If you want a herbal infused oil, such as Calendula, St. Johns wort, or Chamomile, Leave a note with a 1st and second choice and I’ll do my best to provide it. If I have none, you will receive a refund or exchange for similar product.All NaturalOrganicVeganPalm oil freeCruelty freePureNatural oils for Hair CareCoconut OilCertified OrganicExpeller pressed certified organic Coconut oilapplied directly to hair is an excellent emollient and is said to preventprotein loss, which keeps hair looking healthy and shiny.Coconut oil is made up of a saturated fatty acid called lauric acid,which is easily absorbed deep into the hair shaft. Applying a Coconutoil mask to your hair can provide an abundance of moisture. Simplyadd 2-3 tablespoons of Coconut oil to hair from root to tip. Leave for 30 mins to penetrate,then wash out with Castile soap or Shampoo bar.Avocado OilCertified OrganicAvocado oil contains high amounts of protein, antioxidants and otheressential nutrients, including lecithin and vitamins A, D, E, , whichhas made it one of the most popular carrier oils used in naturalhair care formulations today.The proteins in Avocado oil may help to assist in repairing damage andprevent any future breakage. This thick oil is most effective whenapplied directly to medium-thick hair. Alternatively, when Avocado oilis added to a haircare product, it can assist in treating damaged frizzyhair and may even help defend against dandruff and hair loss.Jojoba OilCertified OrganicTechnically not an oil but a wax, Jojoba oil is extracted from the seedsof the Jojoba tree.The wax esters are very similar to the natural sebum produced by ourskin and may help to repair hair cells and restore PH balance. Jojobaoil is high in vitamins A, E and D and is suitable for all hair types.When applied to hair, it moisturises without leaving a residue, whilstproviding a protective barrier against the sun. Jojoba oil can provide acooling effect to the hair and can be most beneficial when used as ahair conditioner.Almond OilCertified OrganicExtracted by cold pressing the almond kernel, Almond Sweet oilcontains all kinds of healthy ingredients like omega-3 fatty acids,phospholipids, magnesium and vitamins A, B and E.Its moisturising, softening and fast penetrating properties nourish andstrengthen hair. Almond oil contains zinc, which may be effective fortreating and controlling hair loss. Warm one tablespoon of AlmondSweet oil and rub gently into the scalp every night after your shower orbath. Leave it on overnight for best results.Argan OilCertified OrganicArgan oil is derived from the kernels of the Argan Tree, which is foundonly in Morocco.This luxurious oil contains vitamin E, omega 3 and 9 fatty acids, andantioxidants, all of which are beneficial for dry, damaged or otherwiseunmanageable hair. Argan oil is also rich in phenols, which benefithair follicles and hair growth. A drop of Argan oil is commonly used asa leave-in hair conditioning treatment, which may help to preventfrizz and flyaways, whilst also working to repair split ends.MoreWeight165 gVarietyArgan, Avocado, Castor, Coconut, Hempseed, Jojoba, Moringa, Olive, Evening Primrose, RosehipSize50ml, 100ml1 review for Organic Oil – Argan, Rosehip, Hemp, Jojoba, Coconut, etc.Rated 5 out of 5jean – 08/10/2019Fairly new client of Penny’s but must tell you I’m already in love with her products. As a lot of comments say the products are so creamy and just a treat to use on your skin, they smell so beautiful and knowing they are cruelty-free, contain no palm oil and support Australian businesses is what i love about them too. Oh did i mention the amazing prices? Try and get comparable products for what these are available for…no way! I’m already realizing Penny has a great love for animals and the less fortunate who she also donates her products to. Highly recommend you give them a go, you wont be disappointed.Loading...Add a review Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a review.This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
