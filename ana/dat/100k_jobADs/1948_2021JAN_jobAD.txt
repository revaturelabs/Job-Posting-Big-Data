"Letter to the editor: Insurance option for COVID-19 jobless - Opinion - The Daily Record - Wooster, OHSectionsNewsSportsEntertainmentLifeObituariesClassifiedsHomesCarsJobsE-EditionLog inLetter to the editor: Insurance option for COVID-19 joblessFridayMay 15, 2020 at 12:39 PM May 15, 2020 at 3:33 PMMillions of Americans have recently lost both their jobs and their health insurance as a result of the COVID-19 health crisis. Many of those people are eligible to purchase health insurance through the federal Marketplace program established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).The recent announcement by the Trump Administration that the enrollment period to purchase Marketplace insurance will not be reopened has created confusion. I am writing to reassure Ohioans that most of you who have lost your health insurance during this crisis are eligible to purchase insurance through the Marketplace.If you are an Ohio resident, previously had health insurance and lost it in the last 60 days, or will do so in the next 60 days, because you lost a job or changed jobs, you are likely eligible for what is called a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) to purchase Marketplace insurance, regardless of the above decision by the Trump Administration.The SEP is not time limited, as is the annual ACA open enrollment period which ended in December 2019. The Affordable Care Act is still the law and the Special Enrollment Period is in place for anyone who loses their health insurance in 2020. There are other circumstances or life changes that could qualify you to enroll outside of open enrollment. Log on to the Healthcare.gov website if you think you might qualify.If you don’t have access to a computer you can also call Healthcare.gov at 1-800-318-2596 to see if you can enroll in a Marketplace plan at this time.Unfortunately, if you had no health insurance prior to this crisis, you will not be able to purchase a plan through Healthcare.gov for 2020 unless President Trump restores open enrollment to the Marketplace.Tim BreinerWoosterCertified Application CounselorFederal Health Insurance MarketplaceSign up for daily e-mailsHome© Gannett Co., Inc. 2021.
