The production milestone also marks another great quarter for CBD Unlimited and it hopes to achieve bigger targets before the end of 2019. The company has demonstrated its ability to run its production activities at full scale.“Last year, we grew CBD Unlimited’s distribution to over 1,000 distribution channels. With full-scale production capabilities, we are confident that we will reach at least 5,000 by 2020,” stated Todd Davis, the Chairman, and CEO of CBD Unlimited.The recently passed Farm Bill contributed to heavy market demandDavis also noted that the Farm Bill which was passed into law in December last year played a role in the surging demand that the company experienced in Q1 2019. According to the CEO’s statement, the company’s national product reach has been growing. He also believes that this growth will allow the company to satisfy the high demand in the market. CBD Unlimited hopes to continue expanding its production capacity in line with the growing demand. The firm also expects demand to continue growing over the next two years.CBD Unlimited has been nurturing a strong product portfolioCBD Unlimited has two main technology products and services that it introduced in 2014, and two hemp-derived all-natural, consumable products that it develops and distributes to the market.
