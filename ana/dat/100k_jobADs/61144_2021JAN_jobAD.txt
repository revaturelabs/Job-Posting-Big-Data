The one (big) area I see missing in this description is project management skills. Marketers responsible for content are increasingly being asked to stretch the goals and function of content deeper through the sales cycle. Traffic and lead gen are a part of the role, but the evolution is going further to sales enablement, sales acceleration and customer retention. That means the content programs need to be more sophisticated, meet the needs of several stakeholders, and take input from multiple groups within the organization. My experience here is that great writing skills, SEO, and things like tone and voice are about the half the job. The other half is managing the collaboration, planning, training and measurement of the programs. That’s something I specify in every new hire we bring on.ReplyMichael Brenner says:	June 16, 2015 at 10:38 am	Great point Jesse. And you would know! I will add this to the post / description and credit you if that’s ok?!ReplyTheresa Mills says:	June 16, 2015 at 10:43 am	Thanks for the great blog! Tell me something, I was looking at Content Marketing Manager jobs yesterday, and a lot of them required solid knowledge of Photoshop and InDesign. I’m not a designer – I’m a writer and content marketer who relies on designers. Do you think this is a skill content marketers now need to have as well?ReplyMichael Brenner says:	June 16, 2015 at 10:59 am	Hi Theresa,I think when you have a small team, you need your content marketing manager to wear many hats. When I started out, my first hire ended up learning photoshop and indesign and getting pretty good at it (@LindseyLaManna – go check her out. She’s a rockstar!)But as we grew and matured, we saw the need for professional design support. Which you can get for a reasonable price. So I would say that it can’t hurt but I would put this skill in the “nice to have” bucket.But I’d love to hear others’ opinions?ReplyTheresa Mills says:	June 16, 2015 at 11:04 am	Thanks! That makes sense.ReplyJesse Noyes says:	June 16, 2015 at 11:06 am	Go for it, Michael!ReplyLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
