This is where the implementation lead is a useful stage in the project’s personnel structure. They have a simple goal – to make sure the plans that need to be completed have enough staffing, time and resources to happen on budget. They often work alongside senior project managers, who rely on them to realise their specific project elements in line with the strategic aims of the company.In some companies the implementation lead is the equivalent to a board level employee, and has decision-making powers or at least the ability to influence the board. Other companies treat the implementation lead as a team leadership role, with the experience to see tasks through to completion but receiving specific instructions from a manager or director.The skills requiredImplementation leads are usually drawn from the ranks of team leaders and project managers to focus on specific activities, for example a design, a model, and idea, a specification, a standard or a policy. Whereas the project manager and/or director is often focused on the bigger picture, the implementation lead will more likely be working directly with the employees who are putting those plans into action. That means the implementation lead has to be a great communicator and has to be able to deal with employees at all rungs of the ladder.Experience in the appropriate sector will naturally count for a lot in your search for an implementation lead role. However, management experience is not always a pre-requisite for some companies, who would value your deep understanding of the discipline you are implementing more highly, as long as you can demonstrate an aptitude for giving and taking instruction.Find Implementation Lead Jobs with Cast UKCompanies with big plans need excellent implementation leads to steer and manage their strategy to completion.

Thanks to the completion of the Grand Union Canal in 1798 and the London and Birmingham Railway in 1837, the city quickly began to expand.During this period, manufacturing became an important part of the local economy, particularly paper-making, printing and brewing.For most of the 20th century, a Rolls-Royce factory was located in Watford, which was responsible for manufacturing jet engines. This site was shut down in the early 1990s and re-born as the world-famous Leavesden Film Studios, which has been used for work on blockbuster franchises like James Bond, Star Wars and Harry Potter.In line with the rest of the country, the service sector has taken over in Watford during the last 20 years and the city is now home to various multimedia companies. What's more, a number of large companies have the headquarters here - including Mothercare, Hilton and JD Wetherspoons.Cast UK - helping you discover new rolesTo find out more about the Implementation Lead opportunities in Watford or elsewhere in the country, contact Cast UK today.Our team of regional experts have significant knowledge of the procurement, logistics and supply chain vacancies in their areas of expertise and they can provide the advice and assistance you need to secure a role that suits your skills and qualifications.To find out more about how Cast UK can help you find and recruit candidates within Watford or source a new job in Watford then contact one of our consultant team on 0333 121 3345.Sales ManagerLondon£50000.00 -
