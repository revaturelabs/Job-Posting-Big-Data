The service was impressive and the technology used to proactively attract candidates meant we didn’t wait long for suitable candidates.They really did care about helping us fill the position in a cost-effective way. Talented Teacher Jobs go the extra mile!” – David Holloway, Director OBE, The Ideas CollegeSocial Media Recruitment for Australian SchoolsIn the current climate, social media is where the majority of Australians spend their time every day. Forward-thinking schools who are observing this behaviour shift are hurrying to engage with candidates where they are spending all of their time online. As a result, reaching candidates through social media is becoming an increasingly popular recruitment method for forward-thinking schools who are adapting to the new challenges faced by the education sector. Moreover, with an 87% increase in social media usage over the past few months alone, more and more candidates are finding jobs on social media channels rather than through job boards or recruiters. As a result, over a third of schools have moved away from traditional recruitment methods and instead use social media advertising to attract candidates.Of the schools that are promoting opportunities on social media, only 6% are doing this effectively. The majority of schools are only able to advertise to candidates who are already directly connected with them online. Learn more about our social media technology to understand the reason more schools are joining us to get the best out of their social media recruitment.Our TechnologyOur clever blend of technology empowers Australian schools to identify and target candidates via social media and Google. This bespoke targeting approach means that schools can reach leaders, teachers and support staff wherever they are online. Our technology targets candidates across numerous social media channels and Google, while they browse. Our technology is unique in that it enables schools to advertise to candidates across multiple touch-points. This approach motivates candidates to engage with the job advert and apply.Using our social media technology results in more applications for schools when they advertise a role with us, as they are engaging with a larger pool of candidates who are online, not just job seekers on job boards and recruitment sites.Data in Your HandsEach Australian school that works with us are given a bespoke dashboard, where they can track any current and previous adverts they have run using Talented Teacher Jobs’ social media technology.
