For the purposes of our build, we will take the student to be someone who spends the majority of their time outside of spandex in the pursuit of learning, often lacking the more practical skills one needs to earn a living.A note about sidekicks. In the late Golden Age, and through the Silver Age of comics, a number of characters gained child sidekicks. Often, these characters were simply younger less powerful versions of the main hero. Generally, this tactic was used by publishers to garner a younger readership. Metahumans Rising provides support for this Batman and Robin styled dynamic, or for games inspired by stories like Wolverine and Power Pack, The student may be a fine jumping off point for younger characters being mentored, or for stand alone heroes such as Spider-Man.Lacking the focus of other careers, the student maintains an eclectic collections of Talents.
