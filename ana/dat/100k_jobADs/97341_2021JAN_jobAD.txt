An eleven year old needs a language school in the south-west of the city, ideally in Солнцево. It should deliver good quality teaching in English and preferably Spanish as well. (As usual, one suspects that it is the relatives of the child who want this - 'I want languages which will be good for a diplomatic career' - just the sort of comment I expect from an ambitious 11 year old). Any recommendations of suitable schools would be appreciated - website urls preferred. Thanks.Back to topcoledavisJoined: 21 Jun 2003Posts: 1838Posted: Sun Nov 04, 2012 12:09 pm Post subject:In case it helps others, a Russian colleague of mine says that Prime School has a branch there.
