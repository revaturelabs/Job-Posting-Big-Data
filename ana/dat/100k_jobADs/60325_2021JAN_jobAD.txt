The functions of Jobcentre Plus are now provided directly through the Department for Work and Pensions. The agency provided services primarily to those attempting to find employment and to those requiring the issuing of a financial provision due to, in the first case lack of employment, of an allowance to assist with the living costs and expenditure intrinsic to the effort to achieve employment, or in all other cases the provision of social-security benefit as the result of a person without an income from employment due to illness-incapacity including drug addiction. The organisation acts from within the government’s agenda for community and social welfare. Job vacancies advertised for employers within each of the public offices use a computer system called the Labour Market System (LMS). A new government website named Universal Jobmatch has recently been launched whereby jobseekers can search for employment and employers can upload and manage their own vacancies whilst searching for prospective employees.Services are provided in the first instance via in-house job-advisors and advisors contacted via telephone. Customers are able to access vacancy information through the Universal Jobmatch. Claims may be made for working-age benefits such as Jobseeker’s Allowance, Incapacity Benefit, Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support or the new Universal Credit.About Job centreFrom 2002 to 2011, it was the name of a government executive agency, formed by the amalgamation of two agencies: the Employment Service, which operated Jobcentres, and the Benefits Agency, which ran social security offices. It reported directly to the Minister of State for Employment.The forerunners of the Jobcentre Plus were the government-run Labour Exchanges, originally the vision of Winston Churchill, President of the Board of Trade and William Beveridge, who had worked for a more efficient labour system in the early years of the 20th century. This was intended to address the chaos of the labour market and the problems of casual employment. This was followed by ‘Jobcentre’ with its orange signage in the mid 1970s and the re-branded ‘Employment Service Jobcentre’ with dark blue signage from 1994 to 2002.The first fifty six Jobcentre Plus Pathfinder offices were brought into existence during October 2001.As part of the Efficiency Savings Programme of 2004, changes were made to the structure and management of Jobcentre Plus as part of the governmental review headed by Sir Peter Gershon and Sir Michael Lyons to increase departmental efficiency amounting to £960 million, a target considered achievable in the period 2007 to 2008. This initial plan was implemented within the Jobcentre structure as the Delivering our Vision Programme. Between 2005 and 2008 directors of the board were to be reduced in number from eight to six, the number of districts from seventy to fifty, the number of management and support staff employed were reduced by 5% and, amongst other things, the number of locations specifically employed to process claims would be reduced from 650 to 77.In the 1990s, the Jobcentre reinforced a dress code which required male staff to wear ties. The code was later held to be in breach of the Sex Discrimination Act.Alternative ways to contact the Jobcentre:If you want to file a complaint against poor services of the Jobcentre within the Department for Work and pensions you can also send a letter to the Jobcentre customer complaint address:Department for Work and PensionsPO Box 50101LondonSW1P 2WUIf you would prefer to speak to the member of staff over at the Jobcentre HQ please use the Job centre Contact Number listed.To Contact the Wateringbury Jobcentre please call the contact number listed, all calls to this 0844 number will forward to the official Jobcentre customer service team via our call forwarding service.Thanks for checking Wateringbury Job Centre Contact Number PageSmart-Caller is a telephone directory and call routing service and is not affiliated with any of the businesses listed inside.The official phone number for the companies listed may be found on the official websites or in the public domain.Calls to our 0843 / 0844 numbers cost 7p per minute plus your phone companys access charge.Calls to our 0870 numbers cost 13p per minute plus your phone companys access charge.0905 960 0214.
