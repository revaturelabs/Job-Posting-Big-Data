We plan and invest in infrastructure to keep the UK on the move. We’re focused on improving the experience of train passengers and road users while delivering value for money for taxpayers. From bringing 122 new high-speed, state-of-the-art trains on to the UK rail network, to developing a pipeline of multi-hundred-million and billion-pound future road projects, this is an opportunity to lead on some of the largest and most complex transport developments this country has ever seen.The roleTaking on one of these important leadership roles, you’ll champion a specific project, programme or portfolio. This might be within the Rail Group, a single, integrated body charged with taking Britain’s railways into the future. Or, you might work as part of the Roads, Places and Environment Group, which is sponsor and client for the £27.4 billion five-year Road Investment Strategy. Both will play a critical role in restarting the UK’s economy.These are high-level, big-picture roles that focus on achieving strategic priorities through the development of productive working relationships between diverse organisations. You will engage key stakeholders, facilitating communication and encouraging collaboration, and work closely with the delivery organisations to challenge and support them. At the same time, you develop an in-house team, monitor project performance and controls, and offer oversight on governance, assurance and risk management issues.About youYou’ll bring substantial experience of managing projects, programmes or portfolios (3PM). Specifically, you will have led on elements of delivery in a fast-paced and complex environment. This should include the management and motivation of colleagues. Your approach will be consultative and collaborative, but you will also be ready to develop options, exercise judgement and make decisions. Well-developed communication and influencing skills are essential, as is the confidence to work closely with senior leaders.More searches like thisTransport / Distribution / Logistics Senior Project Manager jobs in LeedsSendSaveYou need to sign in or create an account to saveBack to topJobsites from RedactiveBuilding ServicesPlanningFacilities jobsPublic Finance and AccountancyQuality AssuranceStructural EngineeringAll Redactive jobsitesSharingTwitterAbout UsContact UsTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyTwitter feedsTwitter feedsAdvertise with us© 2016 - 2021 Redactive Media Sales Limited publishes APM Careers on behalf of APM (Association for Project Management).
