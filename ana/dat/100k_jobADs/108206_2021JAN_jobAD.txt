For example, McDonalds won‚Äôt employ anyone under the age of 14 in NSW, NT, SA and Tasmania, or 15 in Victoria. KFC will only employ teenagers who are at least 14, or 15 years old in Victoria.But there are lots of other jobs that younger teens and tweens can do.

I already looked up the age limit. My mother might not let me be a baby sitter until im 14 because that is the limited age 14-15 and up. I can‚Äôt wait to become a babysitter because I love kids and we could really have fun. Im mature enough and im respectful and I could give them some advice to make money. Then I can still be a babysitter by the time I get 14yrs and already have another job a summer job then I could start my career as I get older.
