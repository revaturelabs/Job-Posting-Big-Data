The movie will be directed by Danny Boyle.You may recall that earlier last month Aaron Sorkin, the screenwriter, told Bloomberg News that Christian Bale was selected for the lead role of the movie without an audition because he was the best actor in a “certain age range.”Sorkin was confident that Bale would “crush it” despite the challenges: he had more words to say than other people have had in three movies combined, and he was present in either every single scene.As it turns out, “after much deliberation,” Bale concluded that he isn’t the right person for the part and decided to withdraw, sources whispered to the Hollywood Reporter without getting into details. What’s interesting, though, is that Bale is the second high-profile actor “refusing” the lead role in the Steve Jobs biopic.Aaron Sorkin’s story is said to be divided into three acts, which show Jobs behind the scenes ahead of three of Apple’s milestone events.Image credit: geekbingeShare & commentShare: Tweet ShareRead nextMTS Launches 4G LTE Network in GrandviewGary NgMon, November 3, 2014Comments: 0Most ViewedYou Can Now Buy the PlayStation 5 in Canada OnlineThu, November 12, 2020How to Close the Stand Ring on Apple Watch Every Single TimeThu, February 2, 2017Tim Cook Asked About Apple Car Rumours in Interview [VIDEO]Sun, January 17, 2021Canadians Can Now Sign Up for Starlink Internet Beta Without an Invite, If EligibleWed, January 20, 2021‘Stop Overpaying’ by Switching Wireless Carriers and More Says Competition BureauMon, January 18, 2021What’s New on Disney Plus in Canada: February 2021Tue, January 19, 2021Designer Imagines Apple’s Time Machine Backup for iPhone [PICS]Mon, January 18, 2021Related ContentSubscribe to our mailing listYes, send me daily emails with Apple news!I consent!Search iPhoneinCanada.caAboutAdvertiseContact UsAndroidinCanada.caCanadian Cellphone Plan Comparison ToolCopyright © iPhone in Canada Blog"
