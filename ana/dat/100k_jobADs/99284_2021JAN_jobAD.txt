Its operations in Africa and Latin America continue to remain closed.Before the pandemic, employee structures were under review at certain operations along with the cost base across its South African businesses.Sun International CEO Anthony Leeming was quoted as saying by Reuters: “The Covid -19 pandemic required us to undertake a deeper review as we anticipate that it will take some time for our properties, in particular our hotels and resorts, to recover.”Following the review, the company decided on the layoffs of approximately 2,300 employees in South Africa.The move is expected to deliver savings of up to ZAR280m ($16.7m) in employment costs, said the report.It will affect the Sun City resort, the Maslow Sandton hotel, the Boardwalk casino and hotel, The Table Bay hotel and Wild Coast resort.
