Mammographers—also called “mammography technicians” or “mammography technologists”—use specialized low-radiation X-ray machines to produce pictures of internal breast structures. They prepare patients for examinations and operate equipment precisely to deliver a clear image. They must be familiar with the equipment (and related software) as well as able to interpret the resulting images to identify any problems or abnormalities.Because patients often feel nervous or uncomfortable during the mammogram, mammographers must be empathetic, compassionate, and reassuring. They should also have effective administrative skills, as they must track and maintain records for all procedures.Search Mammographer JobsAll CT Technologist / Technician Director / Manager of Radiology / Imaging Dosimetrist Echocardiography Technologist / Technician Mammographer MRI Technologist / Technician Nuclear Medicine Technologist / Technician PET Technologist / Technician Radiation Oncologist Radiation Physicists Radiation Therapist Radiologic Technologist / Technician Radiologist Radiology / Imaging Supervisor / Lead Radiology Nurse Sonographer / Ultrasonographer Special Procedures or Vascular Technologist / Technician1-3 of 3 JobsMammographer Technician Travel (Springdale,AR)HealthCare Traveler (Allied Health) - Springdale, AR (16 miles from Rogers, AR)The perfect Vascular Ultrasound Technician Job awaits....19 hours agoMammography Technologist - Full TimeMercy Healthcare - Bentonville, AR (13 miles from Rogers, AR)Completed 40 hours of a documented mammography training program MQSA equivalent, including performance of a minimum of 25 examinations under direct supervision....6 days agoMammography TechnologistMercy - Bentonville, AR (13 miles from Rogers, AR)Completed 40 hours of a documented mammography training program MQSA equivalent, including performance of a minimum of 25 examinations under direct supervision....10 days agoView all jobsDemographic Data for Rogers, ARMoving to Rogers, AR?
