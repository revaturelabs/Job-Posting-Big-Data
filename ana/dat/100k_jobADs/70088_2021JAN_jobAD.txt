A satellite TV installer generally works at a different location within his specified area each day. In addition to installing new satellite dishes, he may also have to repair and troubleshoot satellite service for existing customers.Customer InteractionA satellite TV installer represents the company he works for -- right inside a customer's home. He must have a professional demeanor when he arrives at the home and greets the customer, as well as during the service call. Before setting up the dish, he has to review the customer's order to ensure that he sets up the right products and services. After finding out which televisions the customer wants set up, he returns to his truck or van and make sure he has the right equipment and retrieve it.Dish InstallationBefore installing the dish, the installer must survey the site to determine the best location to place the dish. This sometimes means climbing a ladder to place the dish on top of the home. Once he has found the best location, the installer uses mounts to position the satellite dish and keep it in place. When the dish is properly installed, he ensures that it is secure enough to stay in place during inclement weather, such as heavy rain or wind.Dish SetupWhen the dish is set up, the installer also has to place a receiver unit inside the home, ensuring that it is properly connected to the appropriate television and a broadband connection. He makes sure that the dish and receiver are correctly set up and receiving a signal from the satellite. After he has verified that the setup is complete, he then shows the customer how to operate the equipment. Before leaving, he fills out paperwork to leave with the customer, and he gets the customer's signature to confirm the job is complete.TroubleshootingSome installers work mostly at troubleshooting satellite dishes. They visit homes where the satellite service is not working properly to determine why. An installer who is troubleshooting a satellite dish has to listen to the customer's complaints and come up with a solution. Once he has located the problem, he then has to repair or upgrade the equipment to get it working again.ReferencesDirect TV Job Description: Satellite Installation TechnicianWriter BioMelissa Samaroo is a writer based in Florida.
