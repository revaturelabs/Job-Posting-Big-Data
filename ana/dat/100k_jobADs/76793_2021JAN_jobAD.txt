These are perks, not culture.Company culture is a reflection of behavior. Five years ago we wrote down our values to help guide the way we work. We've since updated those company values to serve our growing team. Please read our values to understand if MailerLite is a good fit for you. Every new team member signs under them along with their job contract.One more thing you should know before applying: As a remote-first culture, it’s super important for us to gather as a group. Twice a year, the MailerLite team enjoys a workation—a paid work trip to an exotic location that facilitates team bonding. In addition to working and learning, we go on adventures, have fun, laugh and create memories together.
