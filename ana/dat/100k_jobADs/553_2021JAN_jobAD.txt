I came to this via the film Tim's Vermeer and the excellence of my county libraryWell this is certainly not a book one could read on a Kindle Hockney works a compelling example of show don't tell though to be fair he does both The book opens with a long section of large format and well reproduced pictures of paintings essential to and the foundation of his arguments goes on to a section of select uotes from historical documents about the uses of mirrors and lenses from Roman times onward the uote from Seneca had me giggling in this age of internet porn indeed there is no new thing under the sun and concludes with Hockney's correspondence with various colleagues that tracks the development of his theses and this very book recursivelyThis last again allows the reader to see the ideas taking shape As a kind of early e mail Hockney and friends evidently conducted a lot of their exchanges via faxed letter speaking of the effect of technology on well everything It is not only due to the fact that most of the participants were trained older academics that the letters are so polished and coherent and camera ready If the same correspondence were conducted after e mail the exchanges might well have been collouial cut up and fluid I am put in mind of the shift between mail and e mail with one of my own overseas correspondents Our paper letters went easily into a later article; I don't think one could do that with our later e mails or at least they'd take a hellalot editing I also saw my own experience of kicking half formed ideas around with friends paving their way for later public utterances all part of the process Hockney lets you see the sausages being made It also sped up the production of the book I expect for a busy artist who likely wanted to get back to painting by thenThe news to Hockney passed on by his tame optical physicist that concave mirrors could produce projections seemed as much news to me as to him until I reflected on telescopes and all those articles I'd read for example about the 200 inch Palomar mirror being ground But I never made the last connections either Made me feel uite IvanishIn my prior exposures to art history the material mostly rolled off me; this I think will stickTa L Remarkable Hockney convincingly demonstrates that starting around 1430 artists used optical devices to capture figures and landscapes realistically This accounts for distortions in perspective and Caravagio like shadows because of the strong light needed to use lensesImpressionists and post impressionists wanted to do something new and so became post lens artists This is a subject that has profound implications for the translation of three dimensional reality into two dimensions as is done in representational painting and has huge relevance to our era of photographic video and film images The binocular eye and the single eyed camera see things differently This handsome publication sets down for the record David Hockney's long and detailed exploration of the techniues and technologies that may have been used by the great masters of European painting He concentrates on the 500 year period from the beginning of the fifteenth century to the end of the nineteenth century In the process one is led to a complete re evaluation and re appreciation of their workThe journey was not simple or straightforward It began with a close examination of Ingres and a uestioning of the techniues used for certain ualities found in his work Hockney suspected that certain optical devices were necessary for the artist to achieve some of the effects produced By examining the changing styles of the the great masters during this 500 year period Hockney came to the conclusion that the techniues used were kept secret for good reasons ‚Äî economic ones for starters but also social ones and the strong presence of mediaeval beliefs that preferred to believe in satanic influence rather than a purely mechanical device dealing with optics meant that being too open about the 'magical' ualities achievable by various types of mirrors and eventually lenses could have dangerous and deadly conseuences Roger Bacon for one suffered by being accused of a non salutary reliance on 'diabolic' contraptions capable of creating 'magic' Hockney began collecting earlier 12th and 13th century texts which from today's perspective are highly suggestive that special optical devices were familiar to those 'in the know' A result of all these mindsets was that artists effectively remained protective and secretive about the devices and techniues they might have use for their works This further resulted in later admirers of their works developing the Romantic concept that these artists were solitary geniuses who had the gift and talent to achieve astonishing effects simply through the acuity and accuracy of their visual and manual techniues It is perhaps this latter view that proved most difficult for Hockney to counter People even today feel that using optical devices for effects somehow implies 'cheating' on the part of the artists Hockney takes pains to point out that that this is simply a misunderstanding it still reuires wonderful skill and expertise to produce masterpieces ‚Äî the use of optical devices does not make this less of an achievementThe book is presented in three parts The first part consists essentially of exuisitely reproduced paintings and drawings and their details ‚Äî all a joy in themselves The second part is a collection of historical documentation which suggest that special techniues were known to certain people and that they could and were used to great effect The third part of the book presents notes correspondence faxes etc between Hockney and various experts in the fields of art art historians and experts in the field of optics It reads much like a detective story The discovery in particular that a 6 cm concave mirror acts precisely like a lens it projects pictures in the right light conditions was a break through momentHockney has presented his arguments in this format to show that in his opinion not only did the artists of the day use whatever deceive they could lay their hand on to help them inter endeavours but also that it is 'obvious' when one realises this fact He also opines that Photography late 19th century and nowadays digital imaging late 20th century will also provide a new lease of life for painting in ways yet to be imaginedThis book makes you look again with renewed insight and excitement into the world of the great European artists ‚Äî one will never again be able to view their works in uite the same way again ‚Äî but this is not to be taken in a negative way far from it ‚Äî we see these wonderful works in anew light that is both revelatory and stimulating Great bookI love controversy especially when it targets the art world when it stirs up the way we perceive and look at great masterful works of art; when it throws a whole new massive spanner into the worksOptics or eyeballed?That is the uestionI thoroughly enjoyed reading this book I savoured it because of the artwork and the new light shining on them I still find myself today picking it up to satisfy a looming uestion checking out uncertaintiesThe author has written a good book without long and technically soporific dissertations but with beautifully illustrated examples and to the point explanationsI found it thrilling in its controversy and inspiring through the art portayedInteresting uestions are raised convincing points of view givenWe the reader the artist are pushed to draw our own conclusionsA good read to open your mind to the shadows lurking behind the art world than a theory on how great art could have been createdIntrigued you should be I know I was Interesting study into some of the techniues of the old masters It turns most of them were probably entrepreneurial than artistic In the early 1400s there is a sudden rise of photo realism in Flemish painting Hockney posits that this is bc of the use of lenses and mirrors He goes on to explain how medieval artisans essentially embraced automation by obviating the need of sketching the subject they were going to paint In the past this was a painstaking task of eyeballing where the artist would have to employ their best draftsmanship skills to jot down their subject which was extra difficult if it subject was live of moving Through the use of mirrors and lenses the subject is projected onto the artists canvas where they can simply trace the outline and make uick annotations This was revolutionary on two fronts it drastically speed up the painting process and drastically improved the photo realism of paintings especially of human subjects This allowed artists and their studios to churn out a lot commissions However this shortcut also comes w tell tale side effects which Hockney uses to expose them artists we revere from Van Eyck all the way down to Rembrandt and Caravaggio Notable exceptions to the lens crazy that took over renaissance Europe was Michelangelo and Rubens who stayed purists #respectI would also be wanton if I didn't highlight one of Hockney's main sentiments throughout his expose the artist makes the marks not the lens He is very clear in that he loses no respect for the old masters in that at the end of the day they still have to compose the piece and execute itIt was also interesting to see Caravaggio's hallmark style that is romanticized as Chiaroscuro which spread throughout the world is just a technical side effect of the heavy use of opticsI would end this review with the little bit of latin I learned from the Rush movie Nihilo sanctum estne? If you are at all interested in looking at paintings this book is THE MUST It will totally change your outlook The crucial book on painting This is one of the most remarkable books I can recall ever reading about any subject It is so iconoclastic and written with such authority by a person so accomplished as a practitioner in the field he examines that the experience it provides is uniue and the euphoria it induces is realBeginning with Van Eyck and heading forward through most every painter of note Caravaggio Velazuez and Vermeer most of all they all used optics lenses specifically to accomplish the miracles they created This technology explains the bounding forward that painting did in the Renaissance and afterwards It explains how masters like Caravaggio did what they did with no drawing and Caravaggio's sudden depiction of deep shadows laughing faces and left hand dominant subjects It explains the multiple vanishing points weird bodies and white tablecloths over patterned tablecloths one finds in Velazuez And it explains perhaps best of all the mask and chandelier in Vermeer's Art of PaintingThis book is remarkable for the creative thinking it inspires about optics technology and the creative process itself One of the best books about art because there is a specific theory directly tied to how artwork is created and then many illustrations are deployed to prove the theory Topics like biography motivation symbolism etc are put to the side to focus on how artists see The discussion on drawing with camera lucida is interesting as Hockney brings up the concept that certain lines look confident but also he can see duration of time in lines which lines were drawn at certain speeds Hockney has a good writing voice but he only uses the necessary amount of text relying on the paintings themselves to show not tell The theory reframes art history the last 1000 years is the optical era and what we consider modern art Cezanne Van Gogh cubism is actually reverting to the pre optic view of the world Essential reading for photographers Researched and written by British artist David Hockney this is a compelling book which explores the how of painting historically Hockney's thesis is that artists ‚Äî particularly those working in the Dutch and Flemish heyday like Van Eyck or Rembrandt ‚Äî were aided by lenses optics and mirrors to help them craft realistic artworks In this visual essay Hockney proposes that these high tech methods date back hundreds of years further back than the common conception among art historians The book reads as if you stumbled into a college lecture and witnessed an incredibly moving account of history by a person so enthralled by a topic that you couldn't help but feel enthralled tooRecommended for art history and museum going nerds Pointed out some necessary things for a painter to realize I sort of understood in general terms that old masters used particular techniues to produce some of the most realistic looking paintings ever made but this told of those on the specific level when and why they used them and most importantly how Optics played an important role in the development of old masters techniues and how those really shaped the reasoning and purpose of painting from the 17th century of painting to now Hockney does an excellent job of piecing together a chronology of the historical use of optics for art making most specifically in pre impressionistic paintingPost navigationPaperback239 pagesSecret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old MastersDavid HockneyDutch21 October 2014David Hockney9789055444182David HockneyNew PostCity of BonesThe Hunger GamesCatching FireHush, HushCity of AshesCity of GlassCity of Lost SoulsCity of Heavenly FireDivergentCity of Fallen AngelsLegendMarkedFallenVampire AcademyThe Tree HouseNetherworldDark ProphetJagannathVicariousThe Assassin's BladeHeir of FireCrown of MidnightThe Assassin and the Pirate LordThe Assassin and the DesertLast SacrificeThe Assassin and the UnderworldRecent PostTwilightFifty Shades of GreyThe Hunger GamesDark PrinceEvermoreThe Hollow KingdomTantalizeMarkedDevil's EmbraceWingsNeedCaptive in the DarkAngels' BloodFirst Grave on the RightBeautiful DisasterGreyMidnight Sun [2008 Draft]Daughter of the Red DeerA Kiss at MidnightBlack IcePrince of ThornsFirelightShapechangersProudly powered by WordPress	| Theme: Remax Store by Themerelic."
