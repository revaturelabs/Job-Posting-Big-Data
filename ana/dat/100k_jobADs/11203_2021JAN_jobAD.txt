As a new graduate veterinarian, I was grateful for this free service that reduces the stress of finding a suitable workplace that would teach and nurture my passions for being a veterinarian. Adam is a genuine and sincere individual who was extremely helpful and lifted a huge burden of looking around in what seemed to be a dire market that was not interested in new graduates. He was easy to talk to and empathetic, and went out of his way to stay in touch, and follow up on the whole process and where I was at, as well as after I had been successful in finding a job that I’m thoroughly enjoying!Featured JobsVeterinary Nurse – West Queanbeya...West Queanbeyan, New South WalesNegotiablePermanentApply NowSurgical/Procedures Veterinary Nurs...Nepean, New South WalesNegotiablePermanentApply NowVeterinarian – Kogarah, NSWKogarah, New South WalesNegotiablePermanentApply NowVeterinarian, Carlton/Kogarah, NSWCarlton/Kogarah, New South WalesNegotiablePermanentApply NowQUICK LINKSMeet the TeamNewsContactGET IN TOUCH07 5646 4077REQUEST A CALLBACKTerms & Conditions | SitemapCopyright © 2021 Seven Resourcing LtdWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.
