Most people who conduct a job search will not be applying for only one job opportunity.If you are in an active job search in Canada, more than likely, you will be applying for many positions – anything that opens up in your city that is in your field of expertise. That can equal many targeted resumes and cover letters.Start with one resume and cover letter that is top-notch before you start tweaking it. Hire me, if you need help to create your documents to move your career forward.Not only will you need to properly target each resume and cover letter for each job posting, but you will also have to keep track of where you’ve applied to and the deadlines for each job posting, among others. This can get overwhelming fast if you are unorganized!Many job seekers have an unrealistic picture of how much time the job hunt will take. If you are currently working full-time but want to change jobs, plan to spend up to 8 hours each week on job searching.If you are currently unemployed, your Canadian job search needs to be your full-time job. However, if you stay organized, your time will be better spent on more critical job searching tasks rather than common ones.Remember: properly managing your Canadian job search is just as crucial as finding job postings and submitting applications.Canadian Job Search Tips to Stay Organized and ProductiveStay CurrentIf you have been searching for several weeks or months, an employer will want to know how you have been spending your time. Have activities with practical application to the job market ready to discuss. For technical people whose knowledge may become outdated quickly, be able to show how you are staying current in your field. An excellent way to stay productive and develop contacts in your area is to look for opportunities to volunteer.Have a Clear Job Target – Career DirectionBefore you begin your job search, you need to determine a clear job target. When conducting your search, make sure you have a clear picture of what is important to you, what you want to do, what you do and don’t enjoy doing, and what skills you have to offer.Get the most out of scrutinizing job postings to write targeted resumes; this is an essential step for many reasons.In short, only you know what kind of work you want and what you are best qualified to perform. Use your time wisely by only applying for jobs of interest. A Canadian job search characterized by applying to any position that pops up will be doomed to fail. You will either end up searching much longer than you need to or end up in a position you may end up dreading.If you are unsure of where you want to end up, first consider your credentials as well as your professional background. This is a significant first step to narrowing your job search. Second, concentrate on your interests and what areas of your profession you see yourself in.For instance, if you are qualified for project management, you may decide that your main interest lies in managing projects within a certain sector—giving you a great starting point in your job search. Within the industry you’ve selected, you have the option of working for various companies which still will give you plenty of variety in your job search, without it becoming overwhelming.The point of focusing your job search is to give you a clear target so that you can develop your resume and cover letters, as well as your whole job search plan around one clear objective. Having a job target will eliminate stress and save you time and energy weeding through a ton of job opportunities that you aren’t interested in or best suited for.Preparing for the job interview is a critical stage to ensure you don’t miss landing a job offer.Develop a Job Search PlanOnce you’ve figured out what you are looking for, develop your job search plan. Your job search will be more effective if you map out your strategy in advance.If you are immigrating to Canada, there are job search steps for immigrants to take to make it easier and quicker.Set daily and weekly objectives so that you have a concrete way to evaluate your progress, and determine the amount of time you will spend on each job search activity like research, targeting jobs, and making contacts.Built your schedule around relevant tasks you know will need to be completed. For instance, updating or creating a searchable and powerful LinkedIn profile, updating and targetting your resume and cover letter for specific postings, networking activities to find the hidden job market, and the actual act of job searching all need to be factored into your schedule.Before you even begin your job search, you should be able to plan the first week’s schedule just off of what you know will need to be completed. Once you create your job search schedule – stick with it! Don’t pick and choose which items to complete as this is the perfect recipe for an unorganized job search disaster.Aim to organize your job searching days just like you would an ordinary workday if you are unemployed. And if you are currently employed, you will need to schedule concrete blocks of time in your day to devote to job searching.Even when organized, job searching is a time-consuming process and will require your regular attention. Make sure to schedule in at least an hour or two of time specific to your job search each day.Keep Logs or Folders of Job Contacts and Positions You’ve AppliedStaying organized is the key to a successful job search. Keeping a log/folder of all of the contacts you have made, and a log/folder of jobs that you plan to contact will help you immensely with staying organized. Especially when you are applying to a whole pile of companies, you will need to keep them all straight.It can be embarrassing to cold call the same company twice.Along the same lines, you don’t want to potentially ruin your chance of an interview if you are on the phone with one of the many companies you’ve applied to and you confuse one company for another.Staying organized is vital for keeping your sanity and making your job search run as smoothly as possible. It will also help you to track your success and progress. Keep your hard copy job search folders close by, or your electronic files in a familiar place on your device. This is especially helpful when you are applying for numerous jobs.Organize your Canadian job search further by keeping detailed notes on each company you’ve contacted or applied to so you can keep them all straight. When you are applying to dozens of companies, you don’t want to have to worry about remembering which one is which on top of your usual job search worries.Your log/folder will end up being your best, most reliable job search companion. It will be an invaluable tool to organize your job search to help land your next big job quickly, easier, and with less stress.Tap Into Your Network for SupportRemember you may need support while undertaking your search. If you don’t have sufficient financial resources, you may want to consider part-time work. Something with a flexible schedule will still allow you to attend interviews.Jobs through a temporary employment agency are another option, as you may need to take an interim job until the position you want becomes available. This type of employment also allows you to broaden your qualifications and develop contacts in your areas of interest.It is essential to have moral support during your job hunt as “no” will often be heard much more than ”yes”, meaning that you will need people around you to boost your confidence. Besides friends and family, another great potential source of moral support can come from old professional colleagues, friends in your field, and new contacts that you make each week. Keeping in touch with these people will also help you to network and find employment.Post Your Resume to Online Canadian Job BoardsMany great online job boards allow you to post your current resume and cover letter directly to their site so that employers can potentially find you without you having even to apply. This strategy can vastly increase your chances of gaining interviews and, ultimately, a job offer. If you are applying for a sales position, ensure your resume is correctly targeted to get the best results.The best and popular Canadian job boards for locating positions in Canada are:IndeedGoogle for JobsGlassdoorElutaWorkopolisJob BankWOW JobsMonsterWorking.comCareerBuilderAnd of course, using the LinkedIn networking site for professionals, the list of job postings are growing daily.Set Canadian Job Search GoalsOrganizing and structuring your Canadian job search will make it much more comfortable, more pleasurable, and will give you a greater sense of accomplishment each day. By giving yourself set goals each day, you will be less likely to get discouraged.Securing a rewarding job in Canada starts with being proactive and recharging your energy along the way.
