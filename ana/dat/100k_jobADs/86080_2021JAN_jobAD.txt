Working in-house or freelance at a magazine or brand, they will oversee the overall vision and strategy of their photographic output. While the position entails big-picture thinking, their expertise will often be required from inception to delivery on specific commissions. This might involve developing a concept, research, commissioning talent and building a team, managing the shoot and feeding back on or selecting final images. A photographic director may start out as a photographer themselves, or in other visual or editorially rooted roles, such as art direction.Please Note: The world of creative careers is broad and ever-evolving.
