LS approach allows a job (lot) to be split into a number of smaller sub-jobs (sub-lots) so that successive operations of the same job can be overlapped. In this connection, the total completion time of the whole job may be shortened. The proposed approach is developed to solve two sub-problems. The first sub-problem is called LS problem in which LS conditions are determined and another sub-problem is JSP after LS conditions are determined. A number of benchmarked problems will be investigated to study the optimum LS conditions in Just-In-Time (JIT) environment. Experiment results suggest that the model works fairly well with different objectives and good solutions can be obtained within reasonable time frame.Original languageEnglishTitle of host publicationProceedings of the 13th Mediterranean Conference on Control and AutomationPlace of PublicationPiscataway, New JerseyPublisherIEEEPages364-369Number of pages6ISBN (Print)0780389360DOIshttps://doi.org/10.1109/.2005.1467042Publication statusPublished - 2005Keywordsjob-shop scheduling problemjust-in-time environmentlot streaming techniquegenetic algorithmAccess to Document10.1109/.2005.1467042Link to publication in Scopushttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=9900Fingerprint Dive into the research topics of 'Lot streaming technique in job-shop environment'.
