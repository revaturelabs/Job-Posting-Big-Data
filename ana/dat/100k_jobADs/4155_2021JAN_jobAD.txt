Established in 1988, the restaurant has enjoyed moderate success in serving up a platter of mouth-watering dishes with Australian references from the Outback Steakhouse menu. Some of the dishes are named after places in Australia (Alice Springs Chicken, Ayers Rock Strip) while others are named from the context of pop culture (Grilled Shrimp On The Barbie, Mad Max Burger).Interestingly enough, the dishes are essentially American despite the Australian theme of the restaurant.
