Now the discussion is BPO is a good career for b.tech students , yes of course BPO has an employment on Technical services (tech support) and there are a lot of opportunities to improve with that and on the other hand if you want to go for higher study then BPO will give you financial support also.Reply With Quote+ Reply to ThreadAny Question?Please type your question or comment here and then click Submit.« What salary can I get in a BPO company? | Is it possible to take MPC admission for Intermediate second year after writing first year exams of BiPC?
