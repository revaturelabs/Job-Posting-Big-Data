My specialty is windows and doors.”AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedTraining is a priority, says Kevin Stricker, president and chief executive officer, “because we pride ourselves on our people’s knowledge when they deal with customers. We have a very generous training budget for all team members, including online and internal courses.”Stricker joined Fries Tallman in 1983, when his father Art was a partner. “I had the worst job in the company, in the saw shed,” he recalls. “Since then I’ve worked in every role except controller.”Article content continuedWhen Art retired in 2001, Kevin took over as owner, president and CEO. “We’re very much a family company,” he says. “It’s important to us that we acknowledge and honour the family dynamic. We’ve instilled that culture and we’ve probably had 95 per cent buy-in from our people. Those who didn’t buy in moved on.”Both Stricker and Dodd are relative latecomers to Fries Tallman, compared to Dennis Vogt. “I’ve been here 46 years,” Vogt says, “starting when I was in my early 20s for the original owners, George Fries and Gord Tallman. It was a small business back then. Over the years it got bigger and bigger, with more buildings and a second store in Fort Qu’Appelle.”“We’ve been well rewarded with financial success,” Stricker agrees. “We had a staff of eight when I started. From the employees’ point of view, we’re different because we make sure they feel valued and important.”After 46 years, Vogt says, “I’ve always liked working here. They’d do anything for you.”This story was produced by Mediacorp in partnership with Postmedia, on behalf of Fries Tallman Lumber.Share this article in your social networkShare this Story: Jobs are built to last at Fries Tallman LumberCopy LinkEmailFacebookTwitterRedditPinterestLinkedInTumblrThis Week in FlyersArticle CommentsCommentsPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion and encourage all readers to share their views on our articles.
