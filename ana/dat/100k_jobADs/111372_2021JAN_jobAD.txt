They include veterans, people with disabilities, refugees, formerly incarcerated individuals, those in low-income areas and 18- to 24-year-olds perhaps trying to land their first job.The program will initially be available in more than 35 cities across the US and Canada, and the nonprofits will connect people who could use some help with Lyft rides. Other partners include United Way and 211, Year Up, Generation, #cut50 (Dream Corps), The Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth and Upwardly Global.Along with trips to and from interviews and job training programs, Lyft aims to help people get to work and home again for their first three weeks of employment. That could ease the burden for them of getting to their jobs until they can pick up a paycheck and pay for transit themselves.Earlier this year, Lyft committed to spending at least $50 million (up to one percent of profits) annually on measures such as transportation infrastructure, sustainability and donated rides. The Jobs Access Program is part of those efforts.Lyft has a number of programs in place to help people in need get around. During the northern California blackouts last week, it offered free rides to relief centers. In recent months, it expanded the availability of wheelchair-accessible rides and non-emergency rides for Medicaid patients.people discounted rides interviewsE-MailFacebookLinkedInTwitterPinterestVKWhatsAppRead The Rest atengadget.comPrevIntel will publicly share its race and gender...NextSee What The Batman’s Zoe Kravitz Could Look...Related NewsThe Secret Life Of A Con Man: 'I Scam Innocent...Here are Larry King’s 10 most memorable interviewsMicrosoft reverses Xbox Live Gold price...Microsoft reverses Xbox Live price hike, will...Los Angeles Covid-19 Update: At Current Pace,...Man pleads guilty to deaths of 36 people in...Subscribe to our NewsletterGet daily news updates right into your inbox!1‘One Night In Miami’ Director Regina King, Scribe & Stars On “A Beautiful Story Of Brotherhood” – Contenders Film2 Wait, The Mandalorian’s Katee Sackhoff Didn’t Know Luke...3 Daily Tarot Card Reading For All Zodiac Signs, January...4 ‘Sound Of Metal’ Team On Pushing The Boundaries In Drama...5 ‘Mank’ Cast On Transporting Into The Golden Age For David...6 Steve Martin Has Thoughts On Whether Planes, Trains And...7 10 Brutal Truths About An Aries Man, For Better Or Worse8 Gangstas, beats and demons: Inside the world of Dr. Dre9 Horoscope For Tomorrow, January 24, 202110 3 tech trends that COVID-19 will accelerate in 2021TermsPrivacyAll Rights Reserved Latest News Search - Top Stories - NEWSiNi"
