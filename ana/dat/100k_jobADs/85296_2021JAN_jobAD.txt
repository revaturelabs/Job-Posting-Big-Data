I was wondering when they were going to do a garden tractor, and I see they finally came through with a David Bradley!Now, I want to see a few of the FOUR wheeled beasties done. That would be awesomely spectacular!AttachmentsP5310214.jpg592.8 KB Views: 148P5310216.jpg597.6 KB Views: 149Just because my thought processes are different than yours DOESNT mean I cant break it as good as YOU can!!.Cub Cadet LT1050 w/Johnny Bucket Jr./MTD SnowblowerJD 155C (YAY!

Still knots of surface rust on them and they spray gunned the green over it. I was kind of disappointed in that, especially when I know you can get rims still in better condition.Just because my thought processes are different than yours DOESNT mean I cant break it as good as YOU can!!.Cub Cadet LT1050 w/Johnny Bucket Jr./MTD SnowblowerJD 155C (YAY!
