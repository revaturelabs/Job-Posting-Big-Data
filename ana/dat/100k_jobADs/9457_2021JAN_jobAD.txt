Do I have to retake the written because it's in a different state or will they accept my CA POST score?2) What is the Video Assessment about? I tried searching for it here but couldn't come up with anything. Seems like it just tests your common sense, but I might be missing something.3) What is I pass all portions? Will I have to go back to Vegas anytime soon after? Will they tell me on the spot?If there are any ex, current or future LVMPD officers out there, any help would be appreciated.R.I.P.

I took it about a year ago and did well on it, but for some reason, they stopped doing the b-pad. The p.t. is easy...no sweat at all...if you go to the website, they have a link that tells you what the current pt exam consists of...when i passed everything, they normally tell you right away whether or not you failed a portion...from my understanding, usually they expedite the out of town applicants right thru...i was testing with this guy from california and his schedule was totally different from mine, but he failed the pt exam.CommentPostCancelCHP Wanna-BeTraining in TanJoin Date: Feb 2005Posts: 47ShareTweet#506-27-2005, 06:00 PMOriginally posted by LVMPD1981from my understanding, usually they expedite the out of town applicants right thru...i was testing with this guy from california and his schedule was totally different from mine, but he failed the pt exam.I'm from California and I can only be out there for about 4 days, so the faster, the better.R.I.P.

Even if you are planning on doing a lateral transfer from another agency.The Video Assessment is just like the B-Pad, I'm betting the changed the name for copyright reasons.If you pass, they will have to come back for a medical, ect. I know they are getting ready to increase academies to 4 a year. The department is moving folks around to support the increase in applicants/new hires. Each academy has about 80 recruits when they start. We are planning on increasing our cops by 1000 within the next 10 years, not counting the retirements ect...CommentPostCancelSerpicoForum MemberJoin Date: Dec 2004Posts: 219ShareTweet#806-28-2005, 07:37 PMIf Vegas Metro handles out of town applicants like NYPD, you'll be in and out within 2 days.CommentPostCancelco911Forum MemberJoin Date: Aug 2003Posts: 464ShareTweet#907-29-2005, 08:08 AMHow long is LVMPD's lateral academy?It is not the critic who counts...CommentPostCancelPPD668Forum MemberJoin Date: May 2005Posts: 69ShareTweet#1007-29-2005, 09:13 AMI think its 3 months longCommentPostCancelMtclem4Forum MemberJoin Date: Jun 2005Posts: 36ShareTweet#1107-29-2005, 12:01 PMI'm from California and I can only be out there for about 4 days, so the faster, the betterI tested for Metro back in summer of 2000. I am going out in September, should only be three days at the most if testing as an out of stater. I am coming from Michigan. I remember I was done in two days last time.CommentPostCancelProWriterCCWriting Implements 24/7Join Date: Apr 2003Posts: 1606ShareTweet#1207-29-2005, 09:18 PMPlan on a full week...When I went through it two years ago in October, the out-of-town process was mandatory orientation Monday, PT Tuesday, written/mini-background Wednesday, Thursday off, B-PAD/Oral Friday. If you fail any element, you're done on the spot and escorted out. If you make it through to the end, you go home with the background/poly questionnaire with instructions for returning it. Then, you go back a month ot two later for the 2nd stage out-of-town series.No longer ignoring anybody here, since that psycho known as \"Josey Wales\" finally got the boot after being outed as a LE imposter by B&G978.
