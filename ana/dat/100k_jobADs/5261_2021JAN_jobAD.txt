C. | Mar 30, 2020 | Divorce, Family Law |Divorce can put financial strain on any family. But during tough economic times, you may be out of work. No matter how it happened, job loss can leave you and your soon-to-be ex-spouse with financial uncertainty.   You may worry about how your loss could hurt your reputation in front of a judge. That’s because they can determine the outcome of things like asset division, spousal support payments and child custody.   It depends on the circumstances  If your job lays you off or forces you into unpaid leave, you may get more sympathy from a judge. If that’s the case, they may give you time to find new work. If you’re paying alimony when you lose your job, you could also request payment reductions. However, if you lost your job inappropriate conduct, theft, insubordination or some other offense, you may not get the benefit of the doubt. Even if you’re not paying spousal or child support, losing your job could skewer a judge’s perception of you as a caretaker. If they see you as irresponsible, they may question if you can be a reliable parent.    How can I make a case for myself?When unemployed, remaining confident and optimistic are crucial for securing your next job. Here’s how you can prove that to a judge:  Tell them about your current job search Show them networking events you’ve attended Bring transcripts of phone calls with recruiters or other employers Talk about interviews you’ve attended Bring copies of your resume and cover letter  Show them your list of references There’s always another opportunity around the cornerLosing your job amid your divorce can feel like the end of the world. Luckily, you can find a way to get back in the labor market and back on your feet during divorce.   FacebookTwitterLinkedInSearch for:CategoriesAlimony And Child Support (18)Blog (10)Child Custody (24)Criminal Defense (8)Divorce (65)Family Law (3)Firm News (150)Mediation (1)Military Divorce (7)Property Division (8)Uncategorized (1)ArchivesJanuary 2021 (2)December 2020 (1)October 2020 (1)September 2020 (2)July 2020 (1)June 2020 (1)May 2020 (1)April 2020 (1)March 2020 (1)January 2020 (1)November 2019 (2)June 2019 (4)May 2019 (5)April 2019 (6)March 2019 (5)February 2019 (3)January 2019 (6)December 2018 (5)November 2018 (5)October 2018 (6)September 2018 (5)August 2018 (5)July 2018 (6)June 2018 (5)May 2018 (5)April 2018 (6)March 2018 (6)February 2018 (5)January 2018 (5)December 2017 (5)November 2017 (5)October 2017 (7)September 2017 (4)August 2017 (7)July 2017 (5)June 2017 (6)May 2017 (5)April 2017 (4)March 2017 (5)February 2017 (1)Recent PostsDo you have to disclose a DUI on the FAFSA?Can you refuse a roadside sobriety test?The difference between standard and aggravated DUI in WyomingHow will you manage if your license is suspended due to DUI?Finding a good job will be easier if your record is expungedSubscribe To This Blog’s FeedPut Our Experience To Work For YouContact One Of Our Experienced Attorneys Today.Office Location:Zubrod Law Office, P.
