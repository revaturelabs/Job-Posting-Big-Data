"France Automobile Industry Is Incapable of Getting the Job Done on Time – French CarsSkip to contentFrench CarsFrench Car Domain Names for SaleFrance Automobile Industry Is Incapable of Getting the Job Done on TimeThe French automobile industry has the audacity of taking over two decades to ban petrol and diesel cars, something other countries will be done by 2030.For some unknown reason, the French automobile industry lives under the notion that it is fine to set targets for something that needs to be settled right away. Recently, it was revealed that it will impede the sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040. How about waiting another century?The so-called optimistic measure was driven by Volvo’s statement to fully go electric by 2019. It is difficult to comprehend why these mega businesses fail to work in a timely manner. By 2040, the damage by extensive carbon emissions would probably have been done.According to European Environment Agency, Automakers like Peugeot, Renault and Citroen are the top three businesses when it comes to lessened carbon emissions. To put into perspective how ridiculous the target set by the French automobile industry is, Norway and Germany have the same targets but for the year 2025 and 2030 respectively. This only depicts the incapability of the French auto industry.France calls itself as one of the leaders in the world’s climate action. With the lenient targets it has set for itself, it is more than difficult for anyone to agree.Author adminPosted on July 12, 2017 July 12, 2017 Categories Electric Cars, European Environmental AgencyTags Petrol and diesel	Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
