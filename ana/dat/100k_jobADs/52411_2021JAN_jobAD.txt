If you put your mind to it, you’ll be able to go into any type of work as long as you have the guts to pursue it. (I mean what’s more challenging than being a teacher?)Skills And Qualities Of Teachers That Makes Them Versatile And Ready For Any Other Type Of JobsLet’s do a quick rundown on the valued skills and qualities of teachers. Because let’s face it being a teacher even for just a year really challenges your skills and makes them sharp more than ever.Highly efficient and organizedThis one is surely on top of the list when it comes to the great skills of teachers. Inside the classroom, a teacher not only needs to keep his or her students organized, a teacher also needs to keep the whole classroom organized too.From classroom supplies, to lesson plans, even small details and information are needed to be kept organized. Organization is key to efficiency and in order for a teacher to effectively teach this is the reason why teachers need to keep themselves organized too.A teacher always needs to be on top of their every task and accomplish each and every one of it within a given timeframe—and this is an important principle to every type of profession not only limited to teaching.Leadership is natural and enthusiasm is never absent—including a sense of humor tooI’ve always loved to go to a class where the teacher shows enthusiasm when teaching because you will certainly get infected with energy and enthusiasm.You will be hungry to learn and I don’t know why, but I seem to quickly absorb the knowledge being passed down to me especially if the teacher is witty and quirky. Maybe it just releases the tension and makes learning fun.Sense of humor really goes a long way for teachers, it removes the awkwardness inside the classroom and also makes everyone much comfortable since it gives the students a sign that the teacher is approachable which is a very important character to develop as a teacher.And this kind of quality will get you far in any type of field you will pursue going into, so keep in mind to be humble but still show that you can lead.Have mastered how to multitask effectivelyIf you will ask a teacher how they do their work effectively, you’ll pretty much get the same answer. Multitasking is an important skill to learn that is also vital for any type of job.If you can’t multitask, you will find yourself having problems finishing task after task. Most teachers have already mastered the art of multitasking and it is really convenient if you have a lot on your plate.It’s like hitting two birds with one stone, finishing one task while doing another is a normal thing for teachers on a daily basis.This is why teachers won’t be having a problem when switching to a career that requires them to multitask most of the time because that’s what they’ve been doing almost every day!Know how to work as part of the teamAnother great skill of teachers is their stance when it comes to being a part of the team. With them being able to interact with different types of people and adjust accordingly let them know where to stand.Teachers always remind and encourage their students to work as a team to enrich their learning experiences inside the classroom.And of course, teachers also have to be coordinated and calibrated with their faculty members to solve issues they are facing within the school and to also help each other to achieve their overall goals as a faculty.Know how important it is to always have room for improvement. Has the willingness to learn and self evaluateThis is also an innate quality of teachers, being the teacher themselves they know that there is always something to improve and something to develop and learn even for themselves.Teachers also love to reinvent themselves from time to time because it is still important to grow and learn new things in any type of career in order for you to be successful.If you are always open to learning new things and have an open mind you’ll be able to take your career into new heights and the rest is up to your own hands.Confident to ask questions and willing to teach and share your knowledgeTeaching is a gift, and I must admit it takes a lot of courage to choose this kind of profession because you already have a glimpse of what is waiting for you ahead.Confidence in asking questions, talking, and sharing your perspective in certain matters is an important quality to have because if you’re new at a job, you should have the courage to initiate and mingle with your co-workers in order to build your network.Can quickly adapt in any type of working environmentTeachers are indeed flexible, and that is a very good quality to possess especially if you are planning to venture into a new job.And we all know that each day inside the classroom is an unpredictable day. This is why teachers are quick to adapt to any type of change and always know how to appropriately handle and respond to each and every type of situation.Interpersonal skills are on point, communication will not be an issueBeing a teacher means you can ace this part because we all know that teachers communicate with students, parents, and other people non-stop.Teachers also have to effectively deliver what they want to say in order for their students to absorb all the lessons given to them, and in any type of job, communication is a top priority in order for the workflow to be effective.They have this magnetic type of personality and a great command of the audience which ultimately makes them an effective teacher.Have a first-hand experience of interacting with different types of personalitiesEvery year students come and go, and teachers always have a chance to come face to face with different types of personalities.From parents to co-teachers, and other workers inside the school premises, this makes teachers have the ability to understand different types of human behavior and how to address them properly.Never-ending patience and commitmentAnother practiced skill of teachers inside the classroom every day is patience. They are patient to teach a child that is struggling to understand the lesson even if they have to explain 10-20 times or even more.They are committed to teach and nurture the young mind of the children they have been entrusted to educate. This is also where teachers get creative in how they can explain things in different ways.Not ready to commit to a career change yet?

School Counselor or Guidance CounselorSchool counselors or sometimes referred to as guidance counselors help students in a lot of ways, they are not in the day to day classroom setup.So if you have a teaching degree and want to be a school counselor you need some additional training. Earning a four-year degree is the first step towards becoming a school counselor or guidance counselor. A degree in education will prepare you for your graduate school which is required for you to become a school counselor.Mostly the master’s degree that you must take is a master of education in counseling which takes two to three years to earn. As a school counselor, you can work in various school environments, from elementary to higher education. School or guidance counselors assist students at all levels.They act as advocates for the students well being. As a school counselor or guidance counselor mostly you will listen to the student’s problems or concerns.Being a school or guidance counselor deals with students’ issues such as bullying, disabilities, low self-esteem, poor academic performance, and social problems, and a lot more even the personal life of the student.You will help students process their problems, improve parent-teacher relationships, assist them with their college applications, jobs, or scholarships, take charge of drug and alcohol prevention programs.School counselors or guidance counselors are responsible for the students’ career development. Counseling is basically designed to aid or support the achievements of students, enhancing the students’ behavior and attendance, help students develop socially.School counselors or guidance counselors help students mediate conflicts between peers, teachers, or parents. School or guidance counselors offer individual counseling to help the students resolve personal problems.They may also offer small group counseling in order to help the students enhance listening and social skills and also to learn to empathize with others.Also, school counselors or guidance counselors may also provide support to school staff or faculty by assisting or giving them some tips on how to improve classroom and behavior management and to be more effective on teaching, also to students wherein they can give tips or give some learning habits which may help them improve their performance as a student.School counselors help students or motivate them toward academic success by implementing a plan that will best fit each student’s needs.Being a school counselor or guidance counselor greatly uses collaborative and leadership skills to ensure that the students are learning and growing effectively within the school and ensures a smooth learning experience for the student.School counselors may use some tests to evaluate the students’ learning experience and improve it depending on the results or the data that they have gathered.In addition to this, school counselors prepare students to be career-ready as for the students who are still unsure of their career, school counselors help the student make a well-informed decision when it comes to their future. School counselors or guidance counselors also work with parents, teachers, and community organizations, bringing people together and collaborating with them to have a better relationship with each other._______________3.) Substitute TeacherBeing a substitute teacher opens up a lot of unexpected situations. Schools call in substitute teachers whenever the full-time teachers are absent, get sick, take maternity leave, or travel. It becomes unexpected because you may not know what subject or grade level you will be teaching.The good part about this is you will always have the opportunity to meet a lot of different students and give them more knowledge and a new perspective towards teaching. Every substitute teaching is different depending on the situation.Sometimes you will follow a detailed lesson plan and achieve the lesson goals, sometimes you will simply look after them while they watch educational videos or complete a task that is given to them by the regular teacher before they leave.As a substitute teacher, it is your responsibility to follow the curriculum or the lesson plans assigned by the regular teacher, assign and explain homework if that is what the regular teacher asks you to do, take attendance and document daily notes, follow the school policies, rules, and regulations at all times, ensure that the classroom and workplace are always kept clean and also compile or make a report for the regular teacher for when he/she comes back.You need a High school diploma or bachelor’s degree in teaching, a certificate in teaching in order to become a substitute teacher, you must be detail-oriented and are able to follow written and verbal instructions, you must be excellent in communicating and interpersonal skills.Being a substitute teacher might seem to be less like a teacher but there still tons of reasons why you should pursue being one. A lot of times a student becomes a substitute teacher to explore the career that they might have if they decided to pursue being a teacher.This is a great way and opportunity to find out if teaching is right for you. It is also a great opportunity to learn what teaching style or specialty suits you the best.And aside from this substitute teaching is a great way for you to earn money if you have problems with your schedule or you do not want to be a full-time teacher, it allows you to be more flexible managing your time.To excel in this role you should have knowledge of effective teaching practices which will ensure that the learning of the students will be smooth and meaningful. You should also expect to handle different grade levels from high school down to elementary levels from time to time.As time goes by you might develop a preference of your choice as you discover yourself on which student or grade level are more fun for you to teach and you are effective when you are teaching them.The workday for a substitute teacher typically lasts six to seven hours ending when the students go home. And if you decide to take on an extended assignment from a school you will have homework to check and lesson plans to make._______________4.) Curriculum Developer/Instructional CoordinatorSchools need experienced teachers to improve the quality of education of the students. The people that are responsible for this job are the curriculum developer also called the instruction coordinator.If you have a strong passion for education and teaching but you don’t want to teach in a classroom five times a week then becoming a curriculum developer or instructional coordinator might be the perfect fit for you.Curriculum developers use their knowledge and experience in creating an effective and appropriate curriculum that aligns with the standards today. Curriculum developers are trained educators who are focused on creating instructional material for the teachers to use in the classroom.Curriculum developers are often found coordinating the implementation of curriculum, analyzing students’ test data, assessing the education standards with the school faculty or staff, recommending textbooks or materials to be used for the education of the students.Most curriculum developers or instructional coordinators focus or specialize in a certain area of education such as elementary education, secondary education, special education, etc… Some curriculum developers work on curating a training program for teachers to help them be familiar with new learning standards and give hem reinventing ways on how to be an effective teacher.If you have been teaching for quite some time now you don’t have to worry about acquiring new skills for this job because most of the core skills of teachers are what curriculum developing job needs but still, you should expect that each skill will be expanded upon completing your master’s degree in curriculum and instruction, here are the five skills you need to be analytical, great in communicating, good decision making, interpersonal and leadership.Here are some of the responsibilities or duties that you may need to fulfill if you are considering becoming a curriculum developer or instructional coordinator although this may vary depending on where you work or how many people you work with.Developing and coordinating curriculum implementation, planning and organizing teacher training, analyzing student test data, recommending teaching techniques, considering the use of new or different technology, mentoring, or showing the teacher how to improve their skills in teaching.Curriculum developers or instructional coordinators have the option to work in different educational environments, the highest percentage of curriculum developers or instructional coordinators are found in elementary and secondary schools and some of them may be found in colleges and universities.Usually, curriculum developers are seen to work with both public and private schools to ensure all of the teaching materials being used are following the established standards.You will usually see curriculum developers collaborating and meeting with school administrators, teachers, and other school support staff. One thing that makes curriculum developers differ from teachers is that they don’t get a break as their work is usually all year round to prepare and be ready for the next school year.As a curriculum developer or instructional coordinator, you must consider what will be the best course of action in order to improve the development and growth of the students academically._______________5.) Training & Development ManagerThere is an uncanny similarity between a Training and Development Manager and a Teacher. Both of which are focused on honing and developing the skills of an individual that they need for long-term success.The only big difference is that a Training and Development Manager usually works under a profit organization, but it is still possible for people who have a teaching degree to apply for this job as long as they have the necessary work experience.For teachers who want to change their careers, this is one of the high-paying jobs that a person with a teaching degree can apply for.The primary role of a Training and Development Manager is to oversee training programs for new applicants of the company as well as the development of staff in a certain field. They are an important part of a company’s workforce as they are the ones who bring out and enhance the effectiveness of each individual of the company.The skills to become a Training and Development Manager are very similar to the skills of a teacher, they should project proper management skills, leadership and the most important thing is to communicate with people inside and outside of their work field.Many teachers who have quit teaching find themselves working in this field as the salary of this job not only supports the daily lives of former teachers, but the similarities of working as a teacher and working as a training and development manager are not that far off from each other so it is easy to adjust and adapt in changing careers.There are many profit organizations that are in need of a training and development manager, some offer way more than the average pay grade so it is wise to take your time and thoroughly search different companies and organizations.The only thing you need to apply for this job is to have a degree and at least a good amount of work experience in managing. There are not going to be any problems for people who have a teaching degree to apply for this job, just be educated by the basics of managing and it will all be good to go.This career path has an average of job growth at 7%, so it is safe to say that it is a job that is needed by many and it will surely grow more as time passes by._______________6.) Post-Secondary InstructorsAnother popular job to take in mind is being a Postsecondary Teacher, this job is recommended for those people who have teaching degrees who want to delve further in the Education field. Post-Secondary Teacher is a job that takes up the role of an instructor that takes up a wide variety of academic, career, and technical subjects that are usually being taught in college.They are often called professors, assistant professors, or adjunct professors; many people with a teaching degree have always dreamt of being a Postsecondary Teacher—the salary is bountiful and they get to work on their specialized subject.Post-Secondary Teachers get to focus more on one category of a certain subject, such as in the field of science, a post-secondary teacher will be hired that is an expert in the science field of astrology.The only negative thing that I can think of about what comes with being a post-secondary teacher is that educational institutions are very strict when it comes to hiring. Most of the universities and colleges require either a doctoral degree or a master’s degree for applicants.There are many responsibilities that come with being a postsecondary teacher and one of which is to make time to meet the classes that you are assigned to. There are many cases that universities and colleges conduct online classes but there are still instances that you need to come to school for a face-to-face discussion with the students.The schedule may be early in the morning or late at night, so people who want this job need to make sure that they can comply with the university’s decision of their class schedule.If you are an avid educator, this will be the perfect job for you as this job will make you focus on your specialized field that can help with the making of your research proposal or case study.Many post-secondary teachers have made several case studies that made their name known throughout the world of educational professors. Making research proposals and case studies will help teachers to get a doctoral degree and it will surely prove your competence as an educational instructor.Being passionate about your job will make your life more enjoyable, being able to put your passion and love together with your work will surely be a satisfying achievement once you will be able to retire.The job of a Post-Secondary Teacher is not an easy task—I know many people who are professors and I have always respected them especially because the amount of work on their plate is not a laughing matter, but if you have the guts and passion to do it then this is the job for you._______________7.) School Social WorkerSocial workers aim to enhance overall well-being and help meet the basic and complex needs of the people within the society or community.Social workers are focused on helping people who are deemed vulnerable as well as living in poverty. School social workers are in charge of assisting and assessing students’ problems or crises, they are the ones responsible for keeping the school, faculty, and staff well informed about the issues or problems that the students are experiencing.They help the school community resolve problems big or small. School social workers have the ability to conduct training for teachers so that they will be aware of the cultural, economic, societal, and health issues that the students might encounter.School social workers will also interact not only with the school but also to the parents and the community. They help the parents be aware and informed on how to create a supportive home environment for their children. They’ll help develop education plans for students dealing with special needs and serve as a connection between community resources like mental health agencies and families to make sure they’re getting the appropriate support.In order for an individual to become a social worker, you need to at least have a bachelor’s degree but if you want to devote yourself to being a social worker then a social work master’s degree is also in need to complete your credentials.School social workers work with the students and teachers to help them address the issues and improve the experiences of the students within the school. Mostly primary and secondary schools have a school social worker, they serve as the advocate or the voice of the students.School social workers develop relationships with families, recommend community resources, and extend support for mental health services and crisis management. Each school social worker should have these skills for them to be more effective in their job.First, you need to have a strong empathy towards others. This will put you in your students’ shoes and you can have a deeper understanding of their concerns, issues, or problems.You need to be good at communicating. You should be clear and transparent towards your students or the community within the school having good communication skills can lessen misunderstandings between you and the community.You need to be organized as you have a lot of daily responsibility, and need to properly manage all the responsibilities that you should do. You need to have patience. You should know that not all your students are the same, some have different cultures and social backgrounds so you must understand them.Lastly, you need to be good at solving problems since your job is assessing and solving the issues that the school might encounter. Most likely if you are a teacher you have these skills as you are with your students all the time so if you want to try another job being a school social worker might be the one for you._______________8.) WriterIf you are an English teacher or just a teacher with good writing or editing skills and you want to find some other job besides teaching then becoming a writer might be the perfect fit for you.In addition to your skills, your experience as a teacher and your teacher’s degree might be a big help for you to easily find a job as a writer or maybe an editor. You may find a job in books, newspapers, blogs, or even publish your very own book if you thrive harder.But if you want to become a writer but don’t want to leave the education field then you can try to write or make your own textbook for the students that they may use in their studies, not only you get to stay in education field but also you get to do what you love to do if you love writing.Aside from all of this you may have the opportunity to work from home as a writer, you can decide what you want to write and publish it. Although beginning as a writer is not that easy some writers are self-employed, they get money by selling their written works on book or magazine publishers.You can find writers doing research for them to obtain or find some factual information in order for their work to be credible, present drafts to clients, choose a subject that interests the readers, writing fiction or nonfiction biographies, stories or scripts, etc.A writer’s main work is to put into words what others might find difficult to articulate. Their job is to capture the attention of the readers or the audience.There is a wide variety of choices you can choose from being a writer some of this is being a content writer which writes about any topic that they are interested, bloggers which writes a post online or web, biographers which writes about a person’s life, screenwriters which writes a script for movies of plays, and a lot more.No matter what you choose from this choices in order for you to become a good and successful writer you need to excel in this skills you need to be disciplined you need to meet the deadlines and be responsible, you need to be creative you should always have ideas, you should have the passion for it, you should have patience since a lot of times writer revise their works, you should have strong determination and also you should have critical thinking skills.Most of the time writers don’t have a work schedule they can do their work whenever they like given that they are following the deadlines. You can get started as a writer by putting your name on your work when writing for a small business or local newspaper.You can advance your career as a writer by building a reputation taking complex writing and publishing your very own work.So if you wish to get out of teaching and want to try another job and you enjoy and have a passion for writing you should try being a writer._______________9.) Life CoachThere are many people who are struggling with life, especially when it comes to their professional and personal issues. These people need help from other people to lead them and make them sure that they have a clear vision of their future.We do not know what will happen in our future, maybe something that you are passionate about last week will decline next week, it is something that everyone has experienced and will continue to experience especially when there is much negativity in our lives.That is why many careers are in the path of understanding and helping humans such as psychologists, guidance counselors, and life coaches.Being a Life Coach is not always a job for everyone, but if you are a person who has a teaching degree and empathy and patience with other people than you are more than enough to be qualified as a life coach. A life coach’s primary objective is to encourage and talk your way to people’s problems whether it is in regard to their career or personal issues.Although the job description of a life coach and a psychologist is similar in a way, the difference between them is that a life coach helps you grow by analyzing your life’s situations and guiding you through them by means of preparing life plans that are designed to help you achieve what you want in life.There is no requirement for becoming a life coach but it is recommended that you join and participate in a life coaching training to improve and make yourself be more credible to potential clients.Being a life coach means that you are your own boss, it may be a bit hard to be a life coach at first but once you have loyal clients, you will be able to find yourself become more stable in your career.For me, taking up a job such as being a life coach is not only fulfilling, but you are basically showing kindness and humility for those people who are struggling in their everyday life. It may not be that of an important job for people who are business-minded but not many people realize that we need more people with this kind of job.Especially now that in this generation that we are living in, there are many people who are lost in life and many who do not know what to do—those who are stuck in the middle that has no idea, getting lost in their jumbled thoughts without anyone to guide them to their right path.Those people who have to teach degrees will be able to help those people who are lost because the whole purpose of being a teacher in the first place is to guide children or people for them to be successful in life. A life coach is no different from a teacher in that aspect._______________10.) Human Resource SpecialistThere are many private companies that are hiring people especially to make their employees more competent. That is where a Human Resource Specialist has taken a place in the business world, their primary objective in the company is to provide support by taking the role of hiring and firing staff in a business.They are also the ones responsible for providing training for staff members inside a company to further improve their skills and provide maximum enhancement to the business.It also has an important role of providing benefits and compensations for their staff to ensure that they are well treated in the company, or if they have any issues and concerns regarding other staff members, they can come and discuss it with the Human Resource Specialist.People who have a degree in teaching will be able to adapt faster in this kind of work as it requires an understanding of human behavior and as well as good communication skills. There are no further requirements to have this kind of work, but partaking in training that gives out HR certificates will surely give you more of a competitive edge.Many private companies and businesses are surely investing to hire a good Human Resource Specialist, so there is no need to worry about where to apply for; just simply look it up online and there will surely be a position open for you.In this type of work, you will be able to test your ability in managing a company’s labor legislation. You are going to take into consideration what the company needs to address but also implement the needs of the staff in order to establish a good relationship between the company and its manpower.Being a Human Resource Specialist has its perks, and the pay grade in this work is above average. If you are able to get an HR certificate that proves your competency as a Human Resource Specialist, then the salary will surely be higher.I personally know people who have teaching degrees that applied as a Human Resource Specialist, they say that the education that they have attained has been a great help in their work.It is not easy work to do as it can take a mental toll on your health since you will be mostly handling disputes between staff but having a mental fortitude of a former instructor is a blessing in disguise.Do not underestimate people in this field of work as they are the ones who can keep both companies and staff happy and content._______________11.) Technical Education TeacherAn educational instructor has always had the image of a teacher who is teaching students, giving them paperwork, quizzes, and examinations and grades their learning performance through those written works.However, it is obvious that being educated by instilling learning to students is not the only way to determine that they will be successful in their field of work someday. They should also be honing their skills as an individual to help them in their daily work and exert more effort that the outcome will be more than what they have bargained for.That is why there is a job for teachers to teach both the practical and basic knowledge—that is the role of a Technical Education Teacher, they are basically instructors for teaching many technical and vocational subjects that encourage the practices of these subjects for their students, in order to hone their skills, making it sure to help them in their future endeavor.The existence of this job practically breaks the traditional learning style of schools, it is shorter to teach students technical and vocational subjects, most of which are only just 2 years instead of the usual 4 years, but it is a good thing that schools are trying new things to help students be more educated and to ensure that the learning they have absorbed will be able to reflect on their skills.Most of the technical and vocational subjects are for skill-based jobs such as auto-repairs, culinary arts, basic healthcare, and many more.For those who are tight in budget and have limited money to invest in education, this is a perfect opportunity for them to take as the technical and vocational subjects are more in demand. That is why Technical Education Teachers are spreading like wildfire to provide teaching to those people who cannot afford universities and colleges.It is a good job for people who have to teach degrees to take, because not only is it close to what they have learned but they will also be able to focus on one category of a subject—making it more simple than regular teachers who have a hard time in following and organizing the curriculum that they have to follow.Many Technical Education Teachers work in public schools, so expect that there will be benefits from the government to receive from. But there are many business schools that also hire Technical Education Teachers, it just depends if that school is solely dedicated to offering technical and vocational subjects.Needless to say, a technical and vocational instructor is a good job for people who have a teaching degree and is also as important to those traditional educators._________________________________________ConclusionA teaching degree does not limit your career option to being a teacher only. Your teaching degree is a blank canvass that can take you to any direction you want to go to.The quality and skills that teachers have developed throughout their careers are much appreciated in other types of industries as well.Can you imagine someone being able to multitask while talking to 5 different little people at the same time?

Will you be able to afford this career change?In any type of career change situation, I think this will be the first question to pop up in your mind especially if you are the breadwinner and you have a family depending on you,You have to answer necessary questions like if you are financially capable of taking a step back for a few months or so? Will you be earning more than what you are earning now, or is it going to be less? Will you be able to adjust accordingly with your current obligations when it comes to your expenses while starting out at your new job?These questions might overwhelm you at first, but if you can carefully plan out this big change that you are plunging into, you should be fine.2.) Is it what you really want?Assess yourself and find out if it is really something you want and you are not just being pressured by an external factor leading you to change your career. Weigh the pros and the cons—also weigh the aftermath of changing from your current job to the new one.Also, make sure that you are fully committed to change. Ask yourself if you have what it takes to pull this through.3.) Will you be happier in this new job?You should also take into consideration your current state before venturing into your new job.
