The HDP5600 is ideal for Government agencies, healthcare facilities, businesses and universities, who are looking for true ‚Äúover the edge‚Äù printing capability. The HDP5600 with it‚Äôs convenient modularity allow it to be easily upgraded to meet expanded printing, lamination, or encoding requirements.HDP5600 Standard Features:This Fargo 93600 HDP5600 ID card printer utilizes a reverse image transfer (‚Äúover the edge‚Äù) printing process to produce vibrant, high definition, full color cards. All Fargo HDP5600 card printers can connect via USB or Ethernet (networked), and include a lifetime warranty on the printhead (three years for all other components with one year of free loaner coverage **USA only).Reverse Image Transfer (Re-Transfer) Card Printing TechnologyThis ID card printer utilizes ‚ÄúRe-Transfer‚Äù printing technology, which diffuses ink (in the form of a ribbon) to a dye receptive film known as a ‚Äútransfer film‚Äù. Once all necessary colors have been applied to the transfer film, it is then fused to a blank PVC or Composite card material. This two-step printing process allows for a high definition ‚Äúover the edge‚Äù printed card. Since the transfer process is not limited by a fixed printhead, but rather utilizes the flexible transfer film material, the re-transfer method is ideal for highly detailed imagery (up to 600dots/in), which can be applied to uneven surfaces such as ID cards with embedded electronic chips (smart cards). Along with advanced printing definition and overall card coverage, the lifespan of a re-transfer printhead is dramatically increased by the lack of contact with the card substrate.600 dpiThis ID card printer prints with a resolution of 600 dpi (dots per inch) or 23.6 dpm (dots per millimeter).Single Sided ID Card PrintingThis ID card printer can print on only one side of a PVC or Composite card.BackSpecificationsPrint MethodHDP¬Æ Dye-Sublimation / Resin Thermal TransferResolutionAvailable in 600 dpi (23.6 dots/mm) or 300 dpi (11.8 dots/mm)ColorsUp to 16.7 million / 256 shades per pixelPrint Ribbon and Laminate OptionsFull-color, YMC*, 750 printsFull-color with resin black, YMCK*, 500 printsFull-color with two resin black panels, YMCKK*, 500 printsFull-color with resin black and heat seal panel for difficult-to-print surfaces, YMCKH*, 500 printsFull-color with resin black and inhibit panel for signature or other nonprinting areas, YMCKI*, 500 printsFull-color with fluorescing and resin black, YMCFK*, 500 printsFull-color with two resin black and inhibit panels for signature or other non-printing areas, YMCKIKI*, 400 printsFull-color in half panel format with a full resin black panel, Half Panel YMCK*, 1000 printsFull-color in half panel with two full resin black panels for producing cards with full-color front and black-only back, Half Panel YMCKK*, 750 printsPremium Resin Black, K*, 3000 printsHDP Film Options:Clear (Approximately 1500 prints) / Standard Holographic (500 prints) / Custom Holographic, special order (500 prints) / High Durable HDP Film (Clear) with increased durability for producing longer life cards (Approximately 1000 prints)Overlaminate Options:Thermal Transfer Overlaminate, .25 mil thick, 500 prints / PolyGuard‚Ñ¢ Overlaminate, 1.0 mil and .6 mil thick, 250 prints (PolyGuard available in a CR-80 patch size).
