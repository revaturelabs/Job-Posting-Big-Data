This means that if I hear someone start talking to my left, if I turn towards them, the sound should seem to come from what I'm looking at - from the front. Useful for 360° spherical audio, fully-interactive VR and experi...000BlogReportShareSaveShare this postingeditdeleteEDITINGToday’s Final Cut Pro 10.4.1, Motion 5.4.1 and CApril 9, 2018, 11:47 amLast Thursday Apple announced that Final Cut Pro 10.4.1 would be available today.
