Conomart Super Stores began operations in 1964 under the name GM Petroleum. Today, with a team of roughly 40 employees, Conomart Super Stores operates seven retail sites, branded as Conoco, throughout Billings, Laurel and Joliet, MT.“Our team has been successful in serving our loyal retail customers throughout the years, and this opportunity is a natural next step to our growth. I’ve been highly impressed with Parkland, its values and culture throughout this process. They have made taking care of our employees and customers their highest priority,” said Dennis Whitmore, President of Conomart Super Stores.“Conomart is an established, well-run company with excellent customer service. This acquisition allows Parkland to build density in southern Montana, where we currently operate under Farstad Oil, but do not have a retail presence. We welcome Conomart’s team into Parkland USA’s Northern Tier Regional Operating Center (ROC),” said Dan Dunstan, Vice President and General Manager of the Northern Tier ROC.The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.PrevPreviousDavison Fuels & Oil Partners with Cadence Petroleum Group	NextOffen Petroleum Announces Pending Acquisition of Bosselman EnergyNext	News ArchivesLubricant NewsPrice Increase Summary as of January 14, 2021	Infineum Announces Lubricant Additive Price Increase	Highline-Warren Acquires BlueDevil Products	Tilley Chemical Company Partners with SK Capital	Valvoline Leads Packaging Innovation with Launch of FlexFill	Matrix Advises Penn Tank Lines, Inc. on the Successful Acquisition of Stardust Transportation, LLC	Chevron and ExxonMobil Announce Price Increases	EnergyExits Announces the Sale of Cross Petroleum	Martin Midstream Partners L.P.
