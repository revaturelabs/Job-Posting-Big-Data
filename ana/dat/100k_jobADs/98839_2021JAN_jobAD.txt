"Pick The Right Glue For The Job: How to Select Adhesives For Bonding Foam | The Foam FactoryPick The Right Glue For The Job: How to Select Adhesives For Bonding FoamPosted on March 22, 2013 by The Foam Factory	Whether you’re rebuilding the engine on a car or helping your child with his or her science project, things always go smoother when you use the right tools for the job. This is equally true in the world of foam, whether you’re a homeowner working on a DIY project or a business making custom seat cushions or foam mattresses.The Foam Factory offers a broad selection of foam products, and along with them, spray adhesives formulated to work with every foam type they offer. This particular post will help you better understand why a process that seems so simple is actually surprisingly complex, and assist you in selecting the right adhesive for your project, with our detailed adhesive breakdown.—First, a little background information on why gluing foam is so unique:(L to R) 3M Super 77, Claire Mist, and Camie 373 Spray AdhesivesDifferent types of adhesive being required for foam is a result of the diversity present in foam materials. In terms of feel, looks, and performance, open-cell foam and closed-cell foam are obviously different products. However, those dissimilarities aren’t just surface-level differences, as the foam types are individually unique due to their chemical and molecular structures. So while open and closed-cell foams still belong to the same family, the compounds they are made of create a range of variables when it comes time to put the materials to use. In this instance, they affect how a particular foam reacts to adhesive. Depending on the foam type, some adhesives may not form a bond strong enough to last, while others can cause a reaction that physically damages or even destroys the foam.Fortunately, this isn’t something that has just recently been discovered, and special adhesive formulations exist for properly bonding all different types of the material. Of course, multiple, similar options can always create confusion without knowing which works best for your application. To make things easier, we’ve created an itemized breakdown of our three spray adhesive varieties.Under each type of adhesive we carry, we’ve listed and linked to the foam types it works best with, as well as what it should not be used with. Whether bonding two pieces of the same material, or gluing to most substrates, just find the foam you’ll be working with, and you’ll find the correct type of spray adhesive for your project!—Spray Adhesive: Claire MistDo NOT Use With: Closed-Cell FoamUse With: Open-Cell FoamThis includes all densities, colors, and firmness values of:Poly FoamSuper Soft FoamDryfast FoamRebond FoamAcoustic FoamSpeaker / Filter FoamPolyurethane Anti-Static FoamDunlop Latex FoamHD36 Foam: Regular and High QualityLux Foam: Regular and High QualityCharcoal Foam: Regular and FirmMemory Foam–3LB ViscoSAVER–4LB ViscoPLUSH–5LB ViscoMAX—Spray Adhesive: 3M Super 77Do NOT Use With: Expanded Polystyrene Closed-Cell Foam (EPS)*Use With: Most Closed-Cell Foams AND All Open-Cell Foams**This includes all densities, colors, and firmness values of:Polyethylene FoamPolyethylene RollCross-Linked Polyethylene (XLPE)NeopreneGym Rubber*3M Super 77’s formulation can physically melt EPS foam varieties, damaging and/or destroying the material.**3M Super 77 bonds more strongly with open-cell foam than Claire Mist but is costlier. Claire Mist is the cost-effective choice for all but the most demanding open-cell foam projects.—Spray Adhesive: Camie 373Do NOT Use With: Open-Cell Foam OR Most Closed-Cell Foams***Use With: Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPS)1LB Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPS)2LB Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPS)3LB Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPS)***Camie 373 is specially designed for use with Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPS) to prevent damage that other adhesives may cause.If you have more questions on how to bond foam once you’ve identified the right adhesive, see our PDF “How To Use Spray Adhesive With General Foam Products” or Contact Us for more information!IMPORTANT: Spray adhesive is ineffective at bonding acoustic foam to painted or bare concrete or cinderblock walls.

Foam-to-foam bonds are generally easier to create than bonding foam to different materials, and when applied properly, the Claire Mist does a good job at the right price. If you follow the instructions detailed in our PDF, How To Use Spray Adhesive With General Foam Products, you should be in great shape!As for classification, there are a lot of different ways foam can be classified, so I’ve passed on your message to our Customer Service team, who will be contacting you to find out a little bit more information about your request. We can, however, say that in general terms, memory foam is an open-cell, temperature-sensitive/visco-elastic polyurethane foam.-Foam FactoryReplyDoug H says:	June 17, 2015 at 1:07 pm	Same question: How do I bond PolyEthylene to PolyStyrene ?ReplyFoam Factory says:	June 22, 2015 at 12:01 pm	We would suggest our Camie 373 spray adhesive for bonding polystyrene to any other foam product we carry.ReplyMatthew Murphy says:	November 26, 2014 at 9:57 pm	how do I bond expanded polystyrene foam with polyethylene foam?ReplyFoam Factory says:	December 1, 2014 at 8:45 am	Hi Matthew,Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is one of the trickier foam types to bond, as certain formulations of spray adhesive – the most typical bonding method for foam – can actually damage and dissolve the foam. Luckily, there are adhesives that are formulated to prevent that exact type of damage, one of which is our Camie 373. While primarily suggested for EPS use due to its non-damaging formulation, it may also be used with other closed-cell foam types, which polyethylene falls under. If you do elect to go with another method, be sure to check the manufacturer’s data to verify that it will not damage either of the foam types you’re working with.I’ve passed your message on to our Sales Team, who should be getting in contact with you soon, to discuss any other particulars of your inquiry. Have a great day!– Foam FactoryReplyAmanda says:	July 7, 2015 at 4:24 pm	What if I am trying to glue polyurethane foam to a material other than another foam? I am gluing it to a foam core poster board.ReplyFoam Factory says:	July 11, 2015 at 10:27 am	For anything that is not foam, we recommend that you first test out any glue / spray adhesive to see if it would work for your application.

The same concept can be used for cutting memory foam. Keep in mind using an electric knife generally yields better results than a sharp carving knife. Link is below:https://www.thefoamfactory.com/seatcushion/diy_cutting.htmlHer is a link on how to glue the foam together after you make the cut:https://www.thefoamfactory.com/seatcushion/diy_gluing.htmlThe glue seam should not be noticeable once you have bed sheets over the topper and mattress.ReplyJeff says:	November 1, 2015 at 3:36 pm	Have torn memory foam mattress pad 1″ thick.

I ordered a mask (marshmallow helmet) for my son’s Halloween costum. I thought it was a plastic one piece deal, that you just slide on head. But when it got here, it was all in pieces, and needed assembly. It is also a very smooth, tight foam, with a shinny finish. It came with this double side tape for assembly. But I don’t want it to fall apart half way through the night !! What type of glue should I use ? Help PleaseReplyFoam Factory says:	November 1, 2019 at 3:27 pm	Elmers glue or rubber cement will work, but you will need to have a clip or something similar hold the foam together for 24 hours. This will allow for the glue to dry and hold.ReplySusan Walker says:	March 27, 2020 at 6:52 am	I am making face shields for hospitals.
