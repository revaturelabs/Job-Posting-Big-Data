And these days, I’m the busiest of freelancers. It’s usually feast or famine and right now, it’s a bit of a feast where food keeps falling on the floor. Can’t keep up with it all. Haven’t seen outside in quite some time. Do we still have a sun?Today at Super Frat, Frat Boy At the Movies looks at The Peanuts Movie.And the Quote of the Day is from Dale Carnegie:“Do the hard jobs first. The easy jobs will take care of themselves.“Share this:Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)└ Tags: Comics, Dale Carnegie, Frat Boy at the Movies, links, quote of the day, Super Frat, The Peanuts Movie, The Webcomic Factory, Tony DiGerolamo, webcomicsComments RSSDiscussion ¬Leave a Reply	Cancel replyThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
