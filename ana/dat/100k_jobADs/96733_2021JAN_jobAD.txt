Amen.Prayer for SustainingDear Sustainer of my soul, I thank You for being with me in a very real way as I pass through this time of testing.

Amen.Prayer for Building ResumeLord my Rock, I’m updating my resume, and everything has changed so much since I last wrote one that I hardly know where to start.

Help me avoid errors and unnecessary wording, and I pray that my resume will effectively lead to interviews and employment. Amen.Prayer for Contacts and ReferencesHeavenly Father, You know how important it is for me in my job search to have good contacts for job leads, and positive references to use when I am applying for work.

I pray for favor in this area. Amen.Prayer to Enhance Skills and KnowledgeSovereign Ruler, now that I am unemployed and looking for new work, please be my faithful teacher in what I need to learn.

Help me to appropriately customize my resume and cover letter, and I pray that You bring them to the attention of those who are hiring. Amen.Prayer for ConfidenceOh God my Fortress, losing my job has been like having a rug pulled out from under me. I find myself doubting my ability, second-guessing my actions, and wondering if I’ll ever find satisfactory employment. Lord, please boost my confidence, so that I have the strength to press on. Remind me of all that I can offer a new employer, and help me be able to articulate that clearly in applications and interviews. Amen.Prayer for Help with StressGod of Peace, please flood me with Your peace that passes understanding, and help me to release this stress that is affecting my mind and actions while I’m searching for a new job. Please minimize the financial impact of my job loss and help me to place my focus on You, for You alone are my strength. May the peace of Christ rule in my heart and mind. Amen.Prayer for Appropriate Action and MindsetLord of Hosts, I confess that I have been wallowing in self-pity rather than being proactive and preparing myself to reenter the job market and replace the job I have lost. Help me turn things around and take the appropriate action I need to find new employment. Help me to focus on a bright future, rather than mourning what has been lost. Help me reign in negative emotions and concentrate on an effective action plan. Amen.Prayer for Reaching OutLord my Stronghold, losing my job has been a devastating blow to my self-esteem, and I’ve been embarrassed to let my family and friends know. However, I realize that it’s important to get the word out there so I can get some solid leads and ideas. Please help me overcome my pride and reach out and let people know what has happened. And may I receive the help I need to find a new job. Amen.Prayer for Personal DevelopmentO Spring of Living Water, now that I’m unemployed, I pray that You will help me use this time of transition in my life to cultivate personal development in all areas – spiritually and emotionally, as well as acquiring new knowledge that will enhance my future career.
