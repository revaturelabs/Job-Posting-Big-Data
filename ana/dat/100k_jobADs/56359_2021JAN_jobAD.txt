Economic data over the last week was mostly soft and has led some to adopt a more pessimistic view of the future demand. Conversely, one could view the 35-day government shutdown as temporarily giving pause to consumer demand which will resume course in February and March as those affected receive their back pay. Globally, demand is slowing, and China is adopting more stimulus to help bolster its economy. Stateside, tighter monetary policy appears to be on hold for the moment, but the stimulative effects from tax reform are fading and Congress has been unable to pass any sort of meaningful infrastructure legislation. For the time being, inflation remains near the Fed’s long-term target and while most economic indicators remain in expansion territory, the rate of expansion has begun to decline. Initial claims for unemployment remain historically low, however they have trended up since September hitting 239,000 for the week ending February 9. This comes amid a record number of job openings in December and small business lamenting they are having difficulty filling openings.The slope of the yield curve flattened last week. Besides a pod of Fed speakers this week (Fed presidents Mester, Daly, Bostic, Williams, Bullard, and Vice Chair Clarida), there’s a fair amount of news. Today is only the NAHB Housing Market Index for February at 10AM ET. Tomorrow are the MBA’s app stats for last week and January’s FOMC meeting minutes. Thursday we’ll have December Durable Goods Orders, weekly Initial Jobless Claims, and the February Philadelphia Fed Survey. Friday: January Existing Home Sales and January Leading Indicators. The yield on the 10-year, which ended last week at 2.67%, is unchanged as are most agency MBS prices.Retire to the South.
