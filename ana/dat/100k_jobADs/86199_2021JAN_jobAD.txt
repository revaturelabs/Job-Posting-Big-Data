We serve Hillsborough, Pinellas, Pasco, and Hernando counties.What is troubleshooting?Troubleshooting is the “detective work” involved in any electrical repair. We need every clue we can get to troubleshoot quickly and accurately. You can help us tremendously by giving us an accurate description of what the problem was and how and when the problem occurred. We test and examine your wiring of course, but first, we listen to you to find out exactly what you have experienced and why you have called us.How long does troubleshooting generally take?Troubleshooting a problem usually does not take very long. The average time is about 60 to 90 minutes. In many cases, the solution to the problem is even easier than finding the actual problem. If we discover that the troubleshooting process will take additional time, we tell you before continuing.How many technicians do you send on a service call?Most of the time, we send one technician. In some cases, two technicians are necessary or more economical than one. In these cases, of course, we send two.Can you fix the problem the same day?90% of repairs or installations are done immediately saving you time and frustration. We will make every effort to do so. More often than not, we can fix the problem very quickly on the same day. Some problems require a city permit, an inspection, or the power company to do work and we have to work with these entity’s schedules.How can I know how much this will cost?Just ask us. Small Jobs Electric® guarantees Instant Pricing on every job. We don’t want to surprise you with a higher bill than you expect any more than you want to be surprised. Once we have diagnosed your electrical problem, we will give you a straightforward price to fix it.Why instant pricing?Instant Pricing means knowing the price quoted is the price we charge. There are never any surprises. Instant Pricing gives you the benefit of having a proficient technician who will do the job right the first time. This pricing system is in contrast to time and material pricing systems where you suffer while the company is rewarded for having inexperienced or slow technicians. By removing the clock emphasis, our technicians don’t feel pressured to hurry, which might cause a mistake, but can take the time necessary to make sure the job is done right the first time.When our technician arrives at your home, they will do a thorough evaluation of your electrical system to determine exactly what your problem may be. They will then explain your repair options to you and then tell you the exact repair/installation cost before any work is done. We want you, our customer, to be comfortable.You should NEVER have to pay the price for slow or inefficient service. But that’s exactly what tends to happen when you pay service technicians by the hour instead of by the job. Because we charge by the job, you never pay for slow or lazy technicians or for run-around time for parts and other materials. It’s in our best interests to work as efficiently as possible, and that is also why we stock our trucks with every imaginable tool and part and train our technicians to do the job efficiently and correctly the first time around.How can I know if my electrical panel is safe?Today, there are two brands of panels that may have major manufacturing and/or design flaws that potentially put homeowners at risk: Federal Pacific Electric panels and certain Zinsco panels. There are also millions of people today who have panels that are more than 40 years old and may no longer protect their homes from overcurrents and short circuits.Are you licensed, bonded & insured?We carry an active license #EC0003040 for the State of Florida which allows us to register and do work in all jurisdictions in the state. Small Jobs Electric® also well exceeds the required state amount of General Liability insurance as well as Worker’s Compensation insurance and we are bonded through a nationally recognized bonding insurance company as required by statute.Will my electrical project require a building permit?Most household service work will not require a permit. Larger projects such as room additions and service and panel upgrades will require a permit and subsequent inspections. Failure to hire a licensed professional could require your work to be completely redone at additional expense.Need further information than those mentioned above?
