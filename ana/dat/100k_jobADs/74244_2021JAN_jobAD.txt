Plenty of people have made mistakes in their past and are actively trying to better themselves. Many folks face barriers to employment and this can impact their lives in several ways from disrupting their livelihoods to effecting their ability to pay their bills and take care of their families.If an employee is considered high risk, the potential barriers to employment may be greater.Our community partner, South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce (SC DEW), offers a service called the Federal Bonding Program that may help. This program is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor and administered by SC DEW.What is the Federal Bonding Program?The Federal Bonding program allows employers to obtain skilled, but barrier-laden workers without taking risks, thus giving the prospective employee a second chance at success. Through the program, a business receives protection via fidelity insurance free of charge and the job seeker gets an opportunity to show employable job skills, which removes the barrier to employment and increases their employability. The program reimburses the employer for any loss due to employee theft of money or property. The program gives an incentive to the employer to hire an at-risk-job applicant.Who are the employees facing a barrier to employment?Justice-involved individuals with a record of arrest, conviction, or imprisonment; anyone who has ever been on parole or probation or has any police records;Recovering addicts who have been rehabilitated through treatment for alcohol or drug abuse;Individuals with poor personal credit records or those who have declared bankruptcy;Individuals lacking a work history;Individuals dishonorably discharged from the military;Workers who need bonding in order to prevent being laid off or to secure a promotion;Anyone else who needs the bond in order to get a job.Employees faced with any of these types of barriers are eligible for Federal Bonding coverage.Who may request the Fidelity Bond?Individual seeking bonding services may contact their local SC Works Center to request a Federal Bonding Voucher.
