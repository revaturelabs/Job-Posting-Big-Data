"Job should be marked as passed if at least one container passes - Build Environment - CircleCI DiscussJob should be marked as passed if at least one container passesBuild Environmentcircle.ymlashok-sc September 16, 2018, 12:27am #1I have a job that is pretty flaky and I’m ok with marking it as passed if at least one of the containers passes. Currently I have two containers that run the job and if one of them fails the entire job is marked as failed. Is there a way to change this rule? I’d like the job to be marked as passed if at least one of the containers passes.Thanks,levlaz September 16, 2018, 12:28am #2ashok-sc:Currently I have two containers that run the job and if one of them fails the entire job is marked as failed. Is there a way to change this rule?There is no way to change this explicitly. However, note that “failure” is determined strictly by exit code. You could write a script of some sort to achieve this condition (i.e. if JOBA OR JOBB passes THEN pass). Then have the script return a non-zero exit code if both jobs fail.system closed December 15, 2018, 12:28am #3This topic was automatically closed 90 days after the last reply.
