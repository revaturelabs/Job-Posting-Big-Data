Sometimes I get hit again. I just saw that they hired someone else a lot more successful than me. It turns out they could really get someone better than me. It's a bad feeling. I'll try to stay positive, but just needed to vent out.1 year ago # QUOTE 6 Jab 0 No Jab !rawen17Rep: 0So I started a new job. It's not perfect and the salary is lower and there are other challenges.

In academia at least we have one (or two) semesters notice if University terminates our contract (except Adjunct).

I am depressed and my colleagues treat me like I have a contagious disease. Be nice to me.Got tenure and still depressed!!1 year ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !« Previous1…1112ReplyPost	Academia is a dead end. OP being denied tenure might be a blessing in disguise.This. My salary is fixed in nominal terms, and thus decays in real terms at the rate of inflation. If I publish well I'll get a $10k bump in 3 years, which means I'll have a smaller salary in real terms as when I was hired 3 years ago, after publishing well (and many get kicked out at my school). In addition, we've had benefits cut, so in fact I'll be getting less. If I continue to publish well, I might get another $10k bump down the road. I can only save about $3k a month on my salary. I'm nearing 40, have little savings, don't own my own car or house. Academia is not a smart financial choice.I wrote this last year. With the benefit of hindsight, I still believe it. I got another 2% salary cut this year in real terms (fixed nominal salary minus 2% inflation). I also got two publications to go down, worked hard on my teaching, did a lot of service, and have worked very hard on new projects. For all this work I was met with a real salary cut.I don't get this. Don't they adjust salary every year for inflation? I am working at the Fed, this is what happens here and it is hard to believe they don't do the inflationary adjustment in academia.Send Post »Markup: a blockquote code em strong ul ol li.Economics Job Market Rumors | Job Market | Conferences | Employers | Journal Submissions | Links | Privacy | Contact | Night ModeDefault Personality Textbook In the Club Rouge Mod Old Krug New Krug Kentucky NuSchool UKAP Sturmy Weather Not Brogues The Real Cambridge Lee Kuan Blue Beethoven Honkers Tokyo Drift Concert Hall Don't Pluck with the Chuck Troll Farm"
