Winfree	I’ve decided that in three years, I’m not retiring, I’m not quitting my job, but I am CHANGING JOBS. The term “retirement” has never set well with me. I also don’t like to say “quitting my job.” Either way, I will continue to stay active in my new job as a FULL-TIME WRITER. Monika and I are already looking for a new home in Bulgaria, a place with few people and a lot of nature, the near perfect place to write in my opinion.Yes, changing jobs. I like that.Share this:TweetPrintMoreEmailLike this:Like Loading...RelatedThis entry was posted in Uncategorized.
