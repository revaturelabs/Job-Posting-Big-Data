Amazon Is Hiring 1000 Full-Time Employees In SchodackSteve KingPublished: August 12, 2020Getty ImagesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterWith unemployment numbers in New York ranging anywhere from 7% to nearly 25% according to the New York Department of Labor. It's obvious that New Yorkers are hurting and employment opportunities, especially full-time jobs with benefits, are few and far between.Yesterday, I wrote about the new Amazon 4 Star Store opening up in Crossgates Mall. Although they haven't announced anything yet, I assume they will be hiring some people to work in the new store.Today, Amazon has announced that they are hiring 1000 full-time, full-benefit roles at its 1 million sq. ft. warehouse in Schodack, NY. Amazon is looking to hire for fulfillment operations, picking, packing, and shipping customer orders.One of the best parts of this job opportunity is that new employees will receive their full-time benefits on their first day of employment. That's almost unheard of in this day and age. Most companies make you wait through a probation period of three to six months before your benefits kick in.In addition to a $15 minimum wage, some jobs offer an even higher hourly wage, Amazon also offers employees a program called Career Choice, which pre-pay 95 percent of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. Of course, almost any field is an Amazon field now. According to News 10, more than 25,000 employees have pursued degrees in game design and visual communications, nursing, IT programming, and radiology.For more information on these Amazon,Enter your number to get our free mobile appemployment opportunities visit amazon.com/Albanyjobs.‚ÄùTownsCategories: Around Albany, Local StuffCommentsLeave A CommentBack To TopFeaturedWho Wrote the Most Beatles Songs?Recommended for YouInformationEEO / JobsMarketing and Advertising SolutionsPublic FileNeed AssistanceFCC ApplicationsReport an InaccuracyTermsVIP TermsFAQContest RulesPrivacy PolicyExercise My Data RightsContactAlbany Business ListingsFollow Us2021 Q105.7, Townsquare Media, Inc.
