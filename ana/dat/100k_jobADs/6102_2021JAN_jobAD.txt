No matter how much social good comes from sustainability, companies aren’t going to make changes unless they help the bottom line. Framework:CR helps “clients understand how they perform relative to their competitors and the expectations of key stakeholders” and offers “guidance and tools to facilitate their transition to better and more sustainable business practices.” You can get a feel for Framework:CR’s work here, and you can also check out their client list, which includes names like Avon Products, Citigroup, H.J. Heinz, Staples, and Symantec. You’ll also want to read up on Framework:CR’s Team—there are only four of them, so it shouldn’t take long. Finally, the Framework:CR Blog is updated frequently, so you should give it a look.
