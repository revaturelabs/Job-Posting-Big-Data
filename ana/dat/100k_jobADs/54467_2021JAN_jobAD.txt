(AP Photo/Hans Pennink)APFacebook ShareTwitter ShareBy Mark Weiner | mweiner@syracuse.comNew York voters disapprove of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s job performance, giving the governor his lowest rating since he took office in 2011, according to a new Siena College poll released today.About 34 percent of voters said Cuomo is doing an excellent or good job, while 64 percent rated his performance as fair or poor.The poll found New Yorkers with mixed feelings about the three-term Democratic governor: Voters said (51-39 percent) that Cuomo has made the state a better place to live during his nine years as governor.A plurality of Republicans, independent voters and Upstate New York residents said Cuomo has made the state worse during his time in office.Voters gave Cuomo credit for putting the state on track to protect the rights of all New Yorkers, provide children with a quality public education and ensure accessibility to affordable health care, said Siena pollster Steve Greenberg.But voters said Cuomo has moved the state in the wrong direction when it comes to creating a fair tax structure and managing state government effectively.New York voters support most of the laws passed by state lawmakers and supported by Cuomo during the 2019 legislative session, the poll found. Those bills include a requirement for childhood vaccinations regardless of religious beliefs, a farmworker’s bill of rights and a ban on single-use plastic bags.Voters disapproved (53-43 percent) of the law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain a New York driver’s license.The poll of 810 registered New York voters took place July 28 through Aug. 1 through calls to land lines and cell phones. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.Contact Mark Weiner: Email | Twitter | Facebook | 571-970-3751Cuomo visits Oswego, fishes Lake Ontario to promote tourismNY waives fees for fishing licenses, cuts camping and park fees 50% through Labor Day.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/21).Cookie Settings© 2021 Advance Local Media LLC.
