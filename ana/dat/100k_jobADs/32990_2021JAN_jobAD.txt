As of 21 March 2020, there have been over 266,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with over 11,100 deaths reported, including among children.In many countries, especially those with ongoing humanitarian crises, the COVID-19 outbreak is creating significant additional pressure on the already overburdened social service delivery systems, exacerbating the vulnerabilities of affected populations. The urban poor, migrant, internally displaced and refugee populations are especially at risk as they tend to live in overcrowded settings, making it incredibly difficult to practice social distancing. These settings often also lack continuous access to basic services. Populations on the move will be further exposed to the disease as basic essential and life-saving services are hindered due to control measures, movement restrictions, border closures and discriminatory access to testing and other health services.The work of UNFPA contributes both to outbreak control and to mitigation of the collateral impacts of the pandemic, including the risks to the continuity of essential social services for children, women and vulnerable populations. The objectives of the organization’s COVID-19 preparedness and response strategy are to reduce human-to-human transmission in affected countries and to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on children, youth and their care providers, especially for the most vulnerable. UNFPA’s strategy is in line with the COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan of the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Inter- Agency Standing Committee (IASC) humanitarian response plan led by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). UNFPA’s response is in line with the eight pillars in the WHO Strategic Preparedness and Response plan and includes:UNFPA will ensure the continuity of national and local health system capacity to provide access to integrated quality sexual and reproductive health including: comprehensive emergency obstetric care, routine antenatal, postpartum care and postnatal care to ensure safe delivery, mental health and psychosocial support, family planning and gender-based violence services, including clinical management of rape, specialized psychological-social support, case management and physical protection / safety and legal services for gender based violence survivors. and gender- based violence services.It will mitigate the impact on supply chain and logistics management for sexual and reproductive health supplies, ensuring continuity of supplies and care for lifesaving sexual and reproductive health services throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. UNFPA will also provide and protect health workers (in particular midwives, nurses, obstetricians and anesthesiologists) by ensuring that basic personal protection equipment is available.UNFPA will provide risk communication and community engagement for primary prevention and stigma reduction, strengthening risk reduction messages and addressing needs of women of reproductive age in quarantine. It will distribute dignity / hygiene kits to ensure that women receive essential items while being provided with gender-based violence, sexual and reproductive health and COVID-19 risk mitigation information.Overall COVID-19 Situation in country: Following the removal of lockdown and curfews by the Government, the COVID has moved to the stage of community transmission with little mitigation measures being implemented in the country. The risk of transmission is projected to rapidly increase, overwhelming the health system capacity to attend the cases requiring medical attention/ hospitalizationUN has introduced SOPs and measures to mitigate this high risk of transmissionSecurity Situation Summary in country and main threats:The security situation across Syria is considered as volatile and unstable. While the main hot spots remain: Daraa, Al-Hassakah, Deir Ezzor, Latakia, Hama, Aleppo and Idlib governorates.As per the updated UN Security Risk Management documents “SRM”, Security Risk levels still unchanged, Substantial in Damascus and its rural side, Substantial in the south including Daraa, As Sweida and Quneitra. Also High in both northern the country in Aleppo/rural Aleppo and north-east in Ar Raqqah, Qamishli Al Hassakeh and Deir Ez Zor. While Idlib is considered on Extreme level.The major threats are considered to be Armed Conflict, Terrorism and Crime, in addition to the ERW/UXO threat is still a major concern across the country.Background Description of Emergency / Justification for RequestAlmost ten years of crisis have had a devastating impact on Syria’s economy, infrastructure, social services and social fabric. The crisis has claimed the lives of more than 250,000 people and has led to massive population displacement and hardship. Of the 22 million inhabitants that Syria had at the start of the crisis in 2011, around 6.6 million are now internally displaced, and close to 5 million have become refugees residing outside the country. More than 80% of Syrians are currently living in poverty, and require humanitarian assistance.Syria’s economy has been devastated by the crisis. Manufacturing, agriculture, transport and communication sectors have been decimated, while the health and education sectors have been hard hit. Thirty percent of the population can no longer meet their basic food needs and school enrollment rates have dropped below 80%, while maternal and child mortality rates have increased by more than 20%. By 2014, the economy had lost an estimated USD 200 billion, and unemployment is now estimated at 50% as compared to 8.6% at the start of the crisis. The vulnerability of women, girls and young people has increased dramatically as a result of displacement, a collapse of the rule of law and due to changing social norms and household structures.Women, girls and youth are increasingly facing the loss of household income and social protection. Sexual violence has been a characteristic of the Syrian conflict from its inception 5 and negative coping mechanisms such as child, and forced marriages are increasingly prevalent among particularly vulnerable populations. Meanwhile, the absence, or unemployment of male relatives requires women and girls to generate additional household income, while social norms increasingly restrict their ability to enter the public space alone.Role Description:Under the overall supervision of the UNFPA Country Office Deputy Representative the Reporting Officer will be responsible for all aspects of programme reporting, including resource mobilization activities, based on information gathered from programme units.
