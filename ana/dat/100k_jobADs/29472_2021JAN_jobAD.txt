The company has already stated its intention to move around 1,000 staff from peninsula property Grand Lisboa to its new Cotai IR.But there appears to be plenty of interest in remaining roles with SJM claiming almost 2,000 applicants were present at its first recruitment drive on 21 to 23 August. Of those, 600 were offered initial selection notices onsite.Available positions were across 30 different departments, the majority being non-gaming, SJM added.The recruitment event was jointly held with the Macao Federation of Trade Unions, General Union of Neighbourhood Associations of Macau, Macau Gaming Industry Labourers Association and Macao Gaming Industry Employees Home. Fresh graduates from local tertiary institutions were also invited to participate.SJM said that all interviews were arranged by pre-appointment due to ongoing COVID-19 guidelines.SJM gives priority to recruiting local talent for job openings and is dedicated to promoting career advancement for local employees, said SJM Chairman Daisy Ho.As a milestone development of SJM on Cotai, the Grand Lisboa Palace is organizing a series of recruitment activities in preparation for its opening. Through multi-channel promotions and collaboration with various organizations, we aim to reach diverse groups of job-seekers in the community.SJM highly values the development of local talent. In addition to creating job opportunities for society, we devote great effort in providing training courses for our employees to encourage self-improvement, which effort has not been suspended even during the pandemic.More:SJM says first Grand Lisboa Palace recruitment drive attracted 2000 job-seekers - Inside Asian GamingRelated PostToo Busy to Read?
