From planning a wedding, to furnishing a room, there is no end to the number of things people use the web for. However with all its infinite options, managing what you find has become a massive undertaking. For years, web users have relied on a browser’s bookmark tool to save what they find, however this has become far too ineffective when attempting to organize more than a few dozen pages. That’s where Juxtapost steps in. Its sole ambition is to provide members with easy-to-use tools to \"bookmark\" the photos they find into categorized postboards (collection of posts) that they can easily curate, even if their collection spirals to hundreds of websites.The social discovery aspect of Juxtapost is just as simple. Members browse the streams of other members to see what they're posting and have the option to comment, share or re-post items to their postboards. The power of social discovery becomes readily apparent when you begin to follow people/friends with your similar style or tastes, it’s like browsing the web with all your friends.Discover why people are choosing JuxtapostIn the end it’s all about making sure you get want you want in a social discovery website.
