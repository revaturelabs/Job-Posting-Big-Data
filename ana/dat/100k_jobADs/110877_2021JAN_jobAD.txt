"things i’m going to miss about my job |Skip to contentHomeAboutPortfolioLinksthings i’m going to miss about my jobAugust 8, 2012This is the last week of my 3-month contract in the Man Lab and I’m not going to lie to you – I’m sad to be leaving. This was by far the most satisfying and fun job I’ve ever had. Sure, there were frustrating moments as there are with every job but I can honestly say there was rarely a day that I wasn’t excited to go to work. And considering we spend most of our waking hours at work, I consider myself very lucky to have landed such a golden (albeit short) position.Here are a few of the things I’ve enjoyed most or am going to miss about the Man Lab:Just having a job in London. The other morning I sat on the counter in the kitchen, eating a bowl of cereal while my husband smeared Bovril on his toast and I thought, this is nice, getting up with him, both of us preparing to go to work. I know it’s silly but it’s so very married. And married life is good.The industrial sized espresso machine in the Camden office. Unlimited espresso, people! UNLIMITED ESPRESSO. Ahem. Maybe not such a good thing.Cup o tea? Cup o tea? Cup o tea? Ringing down the halls. So very British.Researching strange and obscure facts all day. I’d tell you about them but I’m bound by a confidentiality agreement and I’d have to kill you. You’ll just have to wait until the show airs this Fall.No two days were alike in the Lab. Sometimes stressful but never boring.Getting to meet and work with the lovely James May.Wearing jeans or shorts or tank tops or whatever the hell I wanted for that matter. No bullshit corporate dress code.Not having to hide my tattoo.The creative aspect.The way my Production Manager endearingly calls me Old Bean.Catered lunches in the studio.Boy shenanigans and japes. I learned A LOT about men over the past few months.The dart board. I was just starting to get my dart groove on.Man Labia sessions. When there are only 4 girls amongst a dozen men, you gotta talk about girl stuff sometimes.Spending a day shooting in <undisclosed country>.Working in front of the camera and shooting a certain dinner scene with James at 10am (that was not grape juice in those glasses).The laughter. Nay. Hilarity. Most every day.Competing with the boys – whether it be Google hurdles or eating 3 crackers under a minute or typing competitions or how many times can you click the clicker. I acquired some very important skills in the Man Lab.The entire team.I’m going to miss you Man Lab team. Thanks for making me smile every day for the past 3 months. I hope to work with you again someday. Until then, I’ve left a little something* for you on my desk.* Inside joke that never fails to crack me up.Share this:FacebookTwitterPinterestLike this:Like Loading...Relatedfrom → best things ever!, holga← july is…just married →3 Comments leave one →Alison permalink	August 8, 2012 7:15 pm	I hope you can work with them again some day.

Have you shown it here on the blog ’cause if you have it’s never registered with me. And I LOVE to see people’s tattoos – just a weird quirk. Since I do not want to become a painted lady I have to control my own body art – so I think I’m living vicariously through others art…………..I’m happy the job was good 🙂Reply	Penny for your thoughts?
