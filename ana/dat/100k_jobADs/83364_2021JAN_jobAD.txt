I visited twice in the past and was quite impressed. The Job Fair looked interesting and indirectly led me to the job I have now.Any comments from those who attended this year ?Where is the conference next year ? If it is in Al Ain I might be tempted.For those who have never visited let me explain that Al Ain is an oasis town on the border with Oman. Part of the oasis is in Oman (Buraimi). Very interesting.Back to topDisplay posts from previous: All Posts1 Day7 Days2 Weeks1 Month3 Months6 Months1 Year Oldest FirstNewest FirstJob Discussion Forums Forum Index -> United Arab Emirates All times are GMTPage 1 of 1Jump to: Select a forum Where to Begin----------------General DiscussionNewbie ForumCurrent Events ForumTechnology ForumOnline Teaching Forum Africa Forums----------------General Africa Forum Asia Forums----------------CambodiaChina (Job-related Posts Only)China (Off-Topic)Hong KongIndiaIndonesiaJapanMalaysiaPhilippinesSingaporeTaiwanThailandGeneral Asia ForumVietnam Caribbean Forums----------------General Caribbean Forum Europe Forums----------------Czech RepublicFranceGermanyGreeceItalyMacedonia and the BalkansPolandRomaniaRussia & C.I.S.SpainTurkeyUkraineUnited KingdomGeneral Europe Forum Latin America Forums----------------ArgentinaBrazilChileColombiaCosta RicaMexicoMexico (off-topic)PeruGeneral Latin America Forum The Middle East Forums----------------BahrainEgyptIsraelKuwaitOmanQatarSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesGeneral Middle East Forum North America Forums----------------General North America Forum Oceania----------------Australia/New ZealandYou cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forumThis page is maintained by the one and only Dave Sperling.Contact Dave's ESL CafeCopyright © 2018 Dave Sperling.
