In the reasoning (Mental ability) part of every bank examination, questions from 'Syllogism' topic are frequently asked. These type of questions are generally solved by using two methods.i) Through Syllogism rules.ii) Through drawing Venn diagrams.The first method (Syllogism rules) is preferred, when the question has only two statements, but for the questions which have more than two statements, the second method (venn diagrams) is the best. The task of the students for this type of questions is 'drawing the appropriate conclusions', from the given statements. To draw the appropriate conclusion one must think logically to understand the logical implications of the given statements and verify the conclusions for their truthfulness, strictly from the conditions of the statements.Each statement has two words and they are related with each other with some kind of relationship. The relationship in based upon the number (All (or) some) and the nature (positive (or) negative). So, overall we get four types of statements. Study the following examples.a) All Teachers are Professorsb) No Teacher is a Professorc) Some Teachers are Professorsd) Some Teachers are not Professors.(words like 'few', 'most', 'many', 'more' have the same relation as the word 'some' in the statement, and the words like 'Not all' 'All not' have the same relation as the word 'some not' in the statement, the word 'Never' has the same relation as the word 'No' in the statement.)As we have discussed above, that 'venn diagram' method is the preferable method for solving questions, then it is necessary to know how to draw a venn diagram for the given statements. There is a possibility to draw more than one diagram (i.e. different diagrams) to represent the relation between the terms of the statements.For example- Statement: 'All Teachers are Professors.'Statement: 'Some Teachers are Professors'So, the most important part of Syllogism statements is knowing how to draw a 'basic diagram' and an alternate diagram'.For instance, study the following diagrams for the given statements.Statements: All fruits are mangoes.Some mangoes are apples.diagram-I diagram-IIHere diagram-I is called 'a basic diagram'. diagram-II is called 'an alternate diagram.'So, what is the difference we have observed, let us discuss.In diagram-I (basic diagram), 'the fruit circle' and 'the apple circle' were kept away from each other.In diagram-II (alternate diagram), 'the fruit circle' and 'the apple circle' both were intersected with each other. Because of this difference we get two opposite relations between the 'fruits and apples' in the conclusions, i.e. according to basic diagram- 'No fruit is an apple', according to alternate diagram- 'Some fruits are apples'.Hence, these two conclusions together form ' a complementary pair'. So, we mark the answer as 'either conclusion I or conclusion II follows'.So, let us discuss now -i) How to draw a basic diagram?ii) What is an alternate diagram and how do we draw it?iii) Do we need to draw a basic diagram compulsorily for every given statements?iv) Do we need to draw an alternate diagram for every given statements?v) Do we get more than one basic diagram?vi) Do we get more than one alternate diagram?The following are the answers for the above questions.Question No.1.'How to draw a basic diagram'?Answer: When we are representing the given relation between terms of the statements in the form of \"circle representation ' (or venn diagram), we shall take the minimum over laping area in the basic diagram. And another the most important point that, we should always remember is - 'we shall try to keep the circles of the terms away from each other/ one another for which, the specific relation is not given in the statements.Study the following example-Statements: All bags are purses.Some purses are orangesHere in the first statement the relation is given between bags and purses (i.e All bags are purses), so the individual diagram isIn the second statement the relationship is given between purses and oranges (i.e., some purses are oranges). So, the individual diagram isBut there is no specific relation was given between 'the bags and the oranges' so, they could be kept separated from each other.However it is not possible in all cases, in few, even though a specific relation is not given between the words some time they may get intersected or one may come in the other circle. Because some indirect relation flows between/ among the words.Let us study the following examples:Example: 1Statements : All Pens are Books.Some Markers are PensBasic diagramHere also, there is no specific relation was given between Books or Markers, inspite they got intersected because the ralation is given between Pens (which is inside the Books) and Markers.As the relation in 'Some Markers are Pens' 'The Markers' Should intersect with 'Pens' and it is possible only through intersecting 'The Books'. So the relation is established between 'Books and Markers'Example: 2 Statements: All Doctors are MenAll Men are ExpertsBasic diagramHere also, there was no specific relation between 'Doctors and Experts' since the 'Doctor's circle is inside of the Men circle, which is inside the Experts circle so, automatically the Doctor's circle is falling inside of the Experts circle' and the relation is established between 'the Doctors and the Experts. So, from the above examples we understand that in a few cases due to indirect relationship we establish some kind of relationship between those terms, which have not given any spicific relation between them in the statements.Question No. 2:What is an alternate diagram and how do we draw it?Ans: In the alternate diagram we try to overlap the maximum area of the circle. Hence the terms, which have not given any specific relation between them in the statements, we establish the relation (i.e by overlaping or intersection etc.,) in the diagram, without violating the conditions of the statements.Look at the following example:Statements: All animals are birdsSome tigers are birdsso we have now understood the difference between the basic diagram and an alternate diagramQuestion No. 3:\"Do we need to draw a basic diagram compulsorily for every given statements\"?Ans: Yes, the basic diagram is compulsory for any given statements of the premises.3 (a) What is premises?Ans: The statements for which we draw the venn diagram and from them we draw the conclusions.Question No 4:\"Do we need to draw an alternate diagram for every given statements of the premises\"?Ans: No, only when the nagative conclusion follows from the basic diagram, to confirm do we get the positive complementary conclusion for the negative conclusion (which is proved right or follow from basic diagram). We require to draw an alternate diagram. Now study the following example carefully.Statements: All fans are lightsSome lights are fruitsconclusions: i) No fan is a fruitii) Some fans are fruitsBasic diagram for the above exampleFrom this diagram, the first conclusion -'No fan is a fruit' which is a negative conclusion follows.So, to get its positve complementary conclusion.- 'Some fans are fruits' we need to draw an alternate diagram.Alternate diagramSo, we clearly see here 'fans and fruits' circles got intersecting without violating any condition of the statements of the premises. So, the negative conclusion from a basic diagram and positive conclusion from an alternate diagrami.e. i) No fan is a fruit (negative)ii) Some fans are fruits (positive)together are complementary to each other. Hence we mark the answer as 'either conclusion I or conclusion II follows!Here we get two doubts.4(a): For every negative conclusion do we get a positive complementary conclusion?4(b): What happens, if in the set of given conclusions for negative conclusion, there is not any its positive complementary conclusion?Now, Follow the following discussion-4(a) For every nagative conclusion do we get its positive complementary conclusion?Ans: Not necessarily.Example: Statements: All Teachers are ProfessorsNo Professor is a StudentConclusions: I) No Teacher is a StudentII) Some Teachers are StudentsBasic diagram:From this basic diagram we can prove, the given negative conclusion i.e., 'No Teacher is a Student' followsAlternative diagramFrom this also we are proving only the negative conclusion follows. Because we are not getting a different alternative diagrams than the basic diagram. (Because if 'the students circle' has approach (intersect), 'the teacher circle' it should go via 'professors circle', then the condition of the statement i.e., 'No professor is a student' gets violated, hence we have to keep \"professor and student\" circles apart from each other, therefore \"the teacher circle and the student circle\" are also remain apart from each other. Hence there is not any positive complementary conclusion possible for the given negative conclusion.Hence only the conclusion I follows.So, the answer is → only conclusion I follows.Now you can ask 'already in the set of given conclusions we have given a complementary pair i.e.,I. No Teacher is a StudentII. Some Teachers are StudentsSo, do we need to check in the alternate diagram, whether they are complementary to each other or not?Ans: Ofcourse, even though the given pair is a complementary pair, whether they are complementary to each other or not, we have to confirm, by drawing the alternate diagram. Because some times they may not be complementary to each other, which we have proved in the above example.Now the other doubt → \"Now what we should do with the second conclusion i.e., 'some teachers are students'?Ans: We are not able to get this conclusion in the alternative diagram (because in the basic diagram any how it cannot be proved so we try in the alternative diagram) also. Hence the second conclusion does not follow.So, dear friends let us now go back to our doubt 4 (b).4(b): \"What happens if in the given set of conclusions, for the negative conclusion, there is not any its positive complementary conclusion\"?Ans: It's really a fantastic doubt, worth for discussion. There are two important occassionsi) It is not necessary that given negative conclusion definitely follows from the statements. So, under such circumstances, there is no need to give any positive complementary conclusion for it.Look at the following example:Statements: Many tables are chairsAll chairs are benches.Conclusions: No table is a benchNo bench is a tableBasic diagramTags :Alligation and MixtureAlligation And MixtureApril-2020April-2020August-2020August-2020AveragebitbankbitbankBit BankBlood RelationsBlood RelationsCloze TestCloze TestCoding – DeCodingCoding – DeCodingComprehensionDecember-2020Direct and Indirect SpeechDirect And Indirect SpeechDirectionsDownloadEnglish LanguageError Detection in Specific WordsError Detection In Specific WordsExams InformationGeneral AwarenessGeneral Awareness-1General Awareness-2General Awareness-3General Awareness-4General Awareness-5IBPSIBPS - SPECIALIST OFFICERSIBPS SPECIALIST OFFICERSImportant DatesImportant DatesImp Questions - AnswersInput - Output SequenceJobsJuly-2020June-2020June-2020Language partlessonLessonMarch-2020May-2020May-2020MensurationMensurationModel papersNovember-2020Number SeriesOctober-2020Percentagespreparation planingPrevious PapersProfit & LossProject workPuzzle TestQuantitative AptitudeRatio and ProportionRatio And ProportionReasoningSeating ArrangementSeating ArrangementSeptember-2020Simple and Compound InterestSimple And Compound InterestSimplificationsSPECIALIST OFFICERSSpecial StoriesSports TermsSports TermsStatements and AssumptionsStatements And AssumptionsStudy MaterialSyllogismSYLLOGISMSTime and DistanceTime And DistanceTime & Workఇంగ్లిష్ లాంగ్వేజ్‌ఇంగ్లీష్ లాంగ్వేజ్ఉద్యోగాలుఐబీపీఎస్ఐబీపీఎస్ స్పెష‌లిస్ట్ ఆఫీస‌ర్స్‌ఐబీపీఎస్ - స్పెష‌లిస్ట్ ఆఫీస‌ర్స్‌క్వాంటిటేటివ్ ఆప్టిట్యూడ్‌జ‌న‌ర‌ల్ అవేర్‌నెస్‌డౌన్‌లోడ్‌నమూనా ప్రశ్నపత్రాలునిర్మాణాత్మక మూల్యాంకనంపరీక్ష సమాచారంపాత ప్రశ్నపత్రాలుప్రత్యేక కథనాలు‌ప్రిపరేషన్ విధానంభారత రాజ్యాంగ నిర్మాణంభారత రాజ్యాంగం -పరిణామ క్రమంభాషాంశాలురీజ‌నింగ్రీజ‌నింగ్స్టడీమెటీరియల్స్పెష‌లిస్ట్ ఆఫీస‌ర్స్‌BLOOD RELATIONSBlood relations involve analysis of information showing blood relationship among members of a family.

Numerator of that fraction is called rate percent.The term percent means per every 100.50 percent means 50 out of 100.The symbol % is used to denote percent. Ex: 20%, 35%, 80% etc.Percent to fraction: To convert percent into fraction, divide the percent by 100.Fraction to percent: To convert fraction into percent, multiply the fraction by 100.Increment percent =Ex: increment % in 5 and 8 is 3/5 × 100 = 60%.Decrement percent =Ex. Decrement % in 5 and 8 is 5/8 × 100 = 37.5%.Some important percent /fractions.Following rules should be kept in mind for solving the questions on percentage —1. For converting a given percentage into a fraction, divided it by 100 or multiply by2. For converting a given fraction into a percentage multiply it by 100.3. For converting one given quantity, say, x as a percentage of another given quantity, say, y findNote - percentage is never expressed in any unit like rupees or kilos.4. When there are two articles ‘a’ and ‘b’ in a group and in the ratio of a : b then to express any one article as a percentage of the group, divide the article by the total articles of the group and multiplies the whole by 100.Percentage of ‘a’ =And, Percentage of ‘b’ =EXAMPLESExample 4. How many percent is 15 cm of 1 metre?Note: Both quantities are converted into same unit.Example 5. A person spent 85% of his monthly income and thereafter saves Rs.360 per month. Find out his total income.Sol: Suppose his monthly income is Rs. 100Expenditure = 85% = Rs. 85Saving = Rs. 100 – 85 = Rs. 15∴ If saving is Rs. 15 income is Rs. 100∴ If saving is Rs. 360 income is= Rs. 2400Example 6. If a student gets 38 marks out of 50, what is the percentage of his obtained marks?Sol: Percentage of obtained marks= 76%Example 7. If two numbers are respectively 30% and 40% more then a third number, what percentage is the first of the second?Sol: Let the third number be 100∴ First number = 100 + 30% of 100= 130and Second number = 100 + 40% of 100= 140∴ Percentage of the first number to the second number to the second numberExample 8. A student scores 20% marks and fails by 30 marks while another student who scores 32% marks, gets 42 marks more than the minimum required pass marks. What are the maximum marks for the examination?Sol: 32% - 20% = 12%And 42–(-30) = 72∴ 12% marks = 72∴ 100% marks =Example 9. An engineering student has to secure 50% marks to pas. He gets 163 marks and fails by 37 marks.

Farm to MandiEmergency Response and Health System Preparedness PackageThe Government of India announced significant investments to the tune of Rs.15,000 crores for 'India COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package' on 9 April 2020. The funds sanctioned will be utilized for immediate COVID-19 Emergency Response (amount of Rs.7774 crores) and rest for medium-term support (1-4 years) to be provided under mission mode approach.The key objectives of the package include mounting emergency response to slow and limit COVID-19 in India through the development of diagnostics and COVID-19 dedicated treatment facilities, centralized procurement of essential medical equipment and drugs required for treatment of infected patients, strengthen and build resilient National and State health systems etc.iGotThe government of India launched a training module for management of COVID-19 named ‘Integrated Govt. Online training’ (iGOT) portal on Ministry of HRD’s DIKSHA platform for the capacity building of frontline workers to handle the pandemic efficiently. Courses on iGOT have been launched for Doctors, Nurses, Paramedics, Hygiene Workers, Technicians, Auxiliary Nursing Midwives (ANMs), State Government Officers, Civil Defence Officers and other volunteers.‘Digital Infrastructure Knowledge Sharing’ (DIKSHA) platform is well equipped to cater to unlimited demands of learning, anytime, anywhere. Multiple states in the country besides NCERT & CBSE will be using DIKSHA for online teacher training, conducting quizzes, and doing learning activities to promote creative & critical thinking, as well as for ensuring continuity in curriculum linked education for students in these times.National lockdown extendedPrime Minister Narendra Modi announced the extension of a nationwide lockdown till 3 May 2020, to arrest the spread of Covid-19 as the number of novel coronavirus cases were increasing day by day Lockdown 2.0 came into force from 14 April till 3 May 2020. However, the PM said there could be some relaxations in places where there is no hotspot after 20 April. The relaxations include allowing Agriculture activities, Pharma Manufacturing industries in village areas, call centres for govt activities etc. PM also made a seven-point appeal in his address and sought people's support.Pool Testing of COVID-19He also said India received huge benefits from the 21-day lockdown in checking the pandemic and added that the country has dealt with the situation better with limited resources. Pool Testing of COVID-19 Uttar Pradesh government decided to start pool testing of the coronavirus samples. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) gave permission for pool testing to the state in order to help maximise the testing of samples on a daily basis. During pool testing, if 10 samples are mixed and tested for Covid-19 and if they test negative, then it will be an indicator that all samples are negative. But if the test is not negative, then individual testing will be done. This will increase the testing capacity as well as accelerate the process.COVSACKTo intensify fight against Covid 19, Defence Research & Development Laboratory (DRDL) Hyderabad developed ‘COVID-19 Sample Collection Kiosk’ (COVSACK) The COVSACK is a kiosk through which healthcare workers can take coronavirus samples from suspected infected patients.The patient walks into the kiosk and a nasal/oral swab is taken by healthcare professional from outside through the built-in gloves. The kiosk is automatically disinfected without the need for human involvement, making the process free of infection spread.The shielding screen of the kiosk cabin protects the healthcare worker from the aerosols/droplet transmission while taking the sample.ZERO-COVNIT-K (National Institute of Technology - Karnataka) researchers developed a technique named ‘ZERO-COV’ to disinfect personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, surgical masks, vegetables, packaged food items, currency notes and other day-to-day items.By placing these items in the disinfection chamber for 15 minutes, one can ensure destruction or inactivation of bacteria and viruses by 99.9 per cent. Quoting Isloor, it said the technology used is UV-C (ultra violet C type) radiation. It can destroy the nucleic acids of any germs present on the surfaces.UV technology is well proven and accepted by the scientific community and the World Health Organization recommended it for surface disinfection.SGB Scheme 2020-21The Government of India in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India decided to issue Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB).The Sovereign Gold Bonds will be issued in six tranches from April 2020 to September 2020. The Bonds will be sold through Scheduled Commercial banks (except Small Finance Banks and Payment Banks), Stock Holding Corporation of India Limited (SHCIL), designated post offices, and recognized stock exchanges.The investors will be compensated at a fixed rate of 2.50 per cent per annum payable semi-annually on the nominal value. Minimum permissible investment will be 1 gram of gold and the Bonds will be denominated in multiples of gram(s) of gold with a basic unit of 1 gram.The tenor of the Bond will be for a period of 8 years with exit option after 5th year to be exercised on the interest payment dates.The maximum limit of subscription shall be 4 Kg for individual, 4 Kg for HUF and 20 Kg for trusts and similar entities per fiscal (April-March) notified by the Government from time to time. The issue price of the Gold Bonds will be Rs.50 per gram less for those who subscribe online and pay through digital mode.Bharat Padhe OnlineOn 10 April 2020, the Union Minister for Human Resources Development (HRD) Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ launched a week long ‘Bharat Padhe Online’ campaign for Crowd sourcing of Ideas for Improving Online Education ecosystem of India at New Delhi.The campaign is gaining popularity among social media users and the HRD Ministry has received more than 3700 suggestions for ‘Bharat Padhe Online’ campaign in just 3 days on Twitter and e-mail.

Ram sold a cow for Rs.136 at a loss of 15%. At what price should he have sold it to gain 15%?Sol: Let the cost price be Rs.100 then for 15% loss the S.P = 85 and for 15% profit it should be Rs. 115.Rs. 85 is the first S.P, then second S.P. = Rs. 115Rs. 136 is the first S.P =Example 2. A sells a radio to B at a gain of 10% and B sells it to C at a gain of 5%.If C pays Rs. 462 for it, What did it cost to A?Sol: Let the cost price of A be Rs. 100Then the cost price of B be Rs. 110Example 3. A dealer allows 10% discount on the list price of a certain article and yet makes a profit of Rs. 25% on each article. Find the cost price of the article when list price is Rs. 50.Sol: Let the cost price of articles be Rs. 100Then for 25% profit, S.P. = Rs. 125If list price is Rs. 100, S.P. = Rs. 90If S.P. is Rs. 90, list price = Rs. 100Example 4. A person purchases 90 clocks and sells 40 clocks at a gain of 10% and 50 clocks at a gain of 20%. Had he sold all of them at a uniform profit of 15% he would have got Rs.40 less. Find the cost price of each clock.Sol: Let the C.P of clock is Rs. 100 each.By the profit of 10% S.P. of 40 clocks = = Rs. 4, 400By the profit of 20% S.P of 50 clocks = = Rs. 6, 000Total S.P. = Rs. 4400 + Rs. 6, 000 = Rs. 10, 400C.P of 90 clocks = = Rs. 9000By the profit of 15% S.P. of 90 clocks = = Rs. 10, 350Difference = Rs. 10, 400 – Rs. 10, 350 = Rs. 50If the difference is Rs. 50 then C.P. = Rs. 100If the difference is Rs. 40 then C.P. = = Rs. 80Example 5. A man buys 5 horses and 10 cows for Rs. 1,600. He sells horses at a profit of 15% and cows at a Loss of 10% if his over all profit was Rs. 90, what was the cost price of a horse and a cow?Sol: Let x be the cost price of a horse and y be the cost price of a cow∵ C.P. of 5 horses = Rs. 5x and C.P of 10 cows = Rs. 10yHence 5x + 10y = 1,600……..(i)Since the profit is 15% on the horsesTags :Alligation and MixtureAlligation And MixtureApril-2020April-2020August-2020August-2020AveragebitbankbitbankBit BankBlood RelationsBlood RelationsCloze TestCloze TestCoding – DeCodingCoding – DeCodingComprehensionDecember-2020Direct and Indirect SpeechDirect And Indirect SpeechDirectionsDownloadEnglish LanguageError Detection in Specific WordsError Detection In Specific WordsExams InformationGeneral AwarenessGeneral Awareness-1General Awareness-2General Awareness-3General Awareness-4General Awareness-5IBPSIBPS - SPECIALIST OFFICERSIBPS SPECIALIST OFFICERSImportant DatesImportant DatesImp Questions - AnswersInput - Output SequenceJobsJuly-2020June-2020June-2020Language partlessonLessonMarch-2020May-2020May-2020MensurationMensurationModel papersNovember-2020Number SeriesOctober-2020Percentagespreparation planingPrevious PapersProfit & LossProject workPuzzle TestQuantitative AptitudeRatio and ProportionRatio And ProportionReasoningSeating ArrangementSeating ArrangementSeptember-2020Simple and Compound InterestSimple And Compound InterestSimplificationsSPECIALIST OFFICERSSpecial StoriesSports TermsSports TermsStatements and AssumptionsStatements And AssumptionsStudy MaterialSyllogismSYLLOGISMSTime and DistanceTime And DistanceTime & Workఇంగ్లిష్ లాంగ్వేజ్‌ఇంగ్లీష్ లాంగ్వేజ్ఉద్యోగాలుఐబీపీఎస్ఐబీపీఎస్ స్పెష‌లిస్ట్ ఆఫీస‌ర్స్‌ఐబీపీఎస్ - స్పెష‌లిస్ట్ ఆఫీస‌ర్స్‌క్వాంటిటేటివ్ ఆప్టిట్యూడ్‌జ‌న‌ర‌ల్ అవేర్‌నెస్‌డౌన్‌లోడ్‌నమూనా ప్రశ్నపత్రాలునిర్మాణాత్మక మూల్యాంకనంపరీక్ష సమాచారంపాత ప్రశ్నపత్రాలుప్రత్యేక కథనాలు‌ప్రిపరేషన్ విధానంభారత రాజ్యాంగ నిర్మాణంభారత రాజ్యాంగం -పరిణామ క్రమంభాషాంశాలురీజ‌నింగ్రీజ‌నింగ్స్టడీమెటీరియల్స్పెష‌లిస్ట్ ఆఫీస‌ర్స్‌ఐబీపీఎస్‌ ఎస్‌ఓ హెచ్ఆర్ మోడల్ పేపర్ - 2* IBPS SO CWE (11-03-2012)NUMBER SERIESNumber series tests present numerical sequences that follow a logical rule which is based on elementary arithmetic. An initial sequence is given from which the rule is to be deduced. You are then asked to predict the next number or missing number that obeys the rule. Some times you need to find out the wrong number in that series which doesn't follow that rule. To find the rule the following tips will be helpful.1. Try to identify numbersThey may be even numbers, odd numbers, prime numbers, squares, cubes etc or some times they may be more / less than themEx: 26, 37, 50, 65, 82, ..........Here the numbers in the series are 52 + 1, 62 + 1, 72 + 1, 82 + 1 and 92 + 1. The next number will be 102 + 1 = 1012. Examine the difference between adjacent numbers.The difference between two consecutive numbers may be constant, continuously increasing / decreasing, prime numbers, squares, or cubes etcEx: 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, ...........Here difference between the adjacent numbers is 5. The next number is 28 + 5 = 33Ex: 25, 30, 37, 48, 61, ...........Here the differences between the adjacent numbers are 5, 7, 11, and 13 which are prime numbers. The next number will be 61 + 17 = 783. Observe whether there is a multiplication or division pattern between two adjacent numbers.Ex: 8, 16, 48, 192, 960, .............Here the relation between the adjacent numbers is × 2, × 3, × 4 and × 5. The next number will be 960 × 6 = 57604. See if you can find a rule that involves using two or more basic arithmetic functions (+, −, ÷, ×). In the below series, the functions alternate in an orderly fashion.Ex: 5, 7, 21, 23, 69, 71, ..............Here the relation between the adjacent numbers is + 2, × 3, + 2, × 3 and + 2. The next number will be 71 × 3 = 2135. Alternate SeriesSome times two number series are given in a single sequence. In odd places one series and even places another series.Ex: 7, 5, 9, 15, 12, 45, 16, 135, ..........Here, Odd places numbers are 7, 9, 12, 16, .....Differences between the numbers are 2, 3, and 4.The next number will be 16 + 5 = 21Even places numbers are 5, 15, 45, and 135The relation between the numbers is × 3.Tags :Alligation and MixtureAlligation And MixtureApril-2020April-2020August-2020August-2020AveragebitbankbitbankBit BankBlood RelationsBlood RelationsCloze TestCloze TestCoding – DeCodingCoding – DeCodingComprehensionDecember-2020Direct and Indirect SpeechDirect And Indirect SpeechDirectionsDownloadEnglish LanguageError Detection in Specific WordsError Detection In Specific WordsExams InformationGeneral AwarenessGeneral Awareness-1General Awareness-2General Awareness-3General Awareness-4General Awareness-5IBPSIBPS - SPECIALIST OFFICERSIBPS SPECIALIST OFFICERSImportant DatesImportant DatesImp Questions - AnswersInput - Output SequenceJobsJuly-2020June-2020June-2020Language partlessonLessonMarch-2020May-2020May-2020MensurationMensurationModel papersNovember-2020Number SeriesOctober-2020Percentagespreparation planingPrevious PapersProfit & LossProject workPuzzle TestQuantitative AptitudeRatio and ProportionRatio And ProportionReasoningSeating ArrangementSeating ArrangementSeptember-2020Simple and Compound InterestSimple And Compound InterestSimplificationsSPECIALIST OFFICERSSpecial StoriesSports TermsSports TermsStatements and AssumptionsStatements And AssumptionsStudy MaterialSyllogismSYLLOGISMSTime and DistanceTime And DistanceTime & Workఇంగ్లిష్ లాంగ్వేజ్‌ఇంగ్లీష్ లాంగ్వేజ్ఉద్యోగాలుఐబీపీఎస్ఐబీపీఎస్ స్పెష‌లిస్ట్ ఆఫీస‌ర్స్‌ఐబీపీఎస్ - స్పెష‌లిస్ట్ ఆఫీస‌ర్స్‌క్వాంటిటేటివ్ ఆప్టిట్యూడ్‌జ‌న‌ర‌ల్ అవేర్‌నెస్‌డౌన్‌లోడ్‌నమూనా ప్రశ్నపత్రాలునిర్మాణాత్మక మూల్యాంకనంపరీక్ష సమాచారంపాత ప్రశ్నపత్రాలుప్రత్యేక కథనాలు‌ప్రిపరేషన్ విధానంభారత రాజ్యాంగ నిర్మాణంభారత రాజ్యాంగం -పరిణామ క్రమంభాషాంశాలురీజ‌నింగ్రీజ‌నింగ్స్టడీమెటీరియల్స్పెష‌లిస్ట్ ఆఫీస‌ర్స్‌PUZZLE TESTSOLVED EXAMPLESDirections (Q. 1-5) : Study the given information carefully and answer the question that follows :Arvind, Bhaskar, Ravi, Sachin, Tarun, Manoj, Ramesh, Neeraj are eight friends, each of them wears a different colour of shirt viz; Red, Blue, Black, Purple, Pink, White, Brown and Yellow, but not necessarily in same order.

With each subsequent operation, the arrangement of the words and numbers changes. These operations are performed until a final arrangement is reached or is performed in loop. The student is required to identify the hidden pattern in the rearrangement and apply it to the questions.Example:A word arrangement machine when given an input of words, rearranges them following a particular rule in each step. The following is an illustration of input and steps rearrangement.Input : Camp Rule Show Mouth FastStep I : Show Camp Rule Mouth FastStep II : Show Rule Camp Mouth FastStep III: Show Rule Mouth Camp FastStep IV: Show Rule Mouth Fast CampThis is the final arrangement and STEP IV is the last step for this input.What should be the last step of the following input?INPUT: Coal Steer Brief Nap Blast CryExplanation:The given rearrangement has a pattern that can be followed from the input step to the final step, which is Step IV. Observe carefully. The rearrangement follows the following patterns:1. The rearrangement is taking place from left to right.2. The rearrangement is taking place one word at a time.3. The rearrangement is done on the basis of decreasing alphabetic order.NOTE:　To understand the pattern, often it is sufficient to look at the input, 1st, 2nd and final steps of the arrangement.Now if we apply the same pattern rules to the second input given, we can immediately tell what the output (final step after rearrangement) would be:INPUT: Coal Steer Brief　Nap Blast　CryOUTPUT: Steer　Nap Cry Coal Brief　BlastTYPES OF QUESTIONSBased on the logic used behind the rearrangement, we can classify these types of questions as:A. Rearrangements based on Ordering:Words are arranged alphabetically (forward or reversed) as per their positions in the dictionary while numbers are arranged in ascending/descending order.Both words and numbers could be arranged individually or simultaneously in each step. The rearrangement can start from the leftmost side or the rightmost side of the sentence and sometimes even simultaneously from both the ends. The rearrangement could either start with a word or a number. Whatever the finer details may be, in these kinds of rearrangements, one or two words/numbers are shifted at a time, without changing the order of the remaining words/numbers.Example:Input : 71 cowboy dye zirconium 92 45 66 banditStep I : 45 71 cowboy dye 92 66 bandit zirconiumStep II : 45 66 71 cowboy 92 bandit dye zirconiumStep III: 45 66 71 92 bandi t cowboy dye zirconiumHere, Step III is the final step and the rearrangement is done simultaneously from both front and back ends. The rearrangements are done this way : the numbers are arranged in ascending order one by one from the left end, with the next biggest number being added to the right of the previous number. The words are arranged in descending order one by one from the right end, with the last word in the dictionary going to the rightmost end, and earlier entries in the dictionary getting added in subsequent steps to the left of that word.B. Rearrangements based on Interchanging the Positions of Words and Numbers:Specific positions are selected and the positions of only those words/numbers are exchanged. The positions of all others remain unchanged.Example:Input : 102 bobby indica 49 diamond 22 gas figure 75 20Step I : 20 bobby indica 49 diamond 22 gas figure 75 102'bobby' is already arranged, so we will move on to the next element.Step II : 20 bobby 22 49 diamond indica gas figure 75 102Step III: 20 bobby 22 diamond 49 indica gas figure 75 102Step IV : 20 bobby 22 diamond 49 figure gas indica 75 102Step V : 20 bobby 22 diamond 49 figure 75 indica gas 102Step VI : 20 bobby 22 diamond 49 figure 75 gas indica 102Step VII : 20 bobby 22 diamond 49 figure 75 gas 102 indicaStep VII is the final step of the input. The underlined words are used to indicate the words that will be interchanged in the each subsequent step.C. Rearrangements based on Mathematical operations:Some mathematical operation (like squaring the number, adding the digits within the number, some common number added/subtracted/multiplied/divided to each number etc.) is applied on the numbers in each step.Example:Input : 17 25 92 88 19 52Step I : 10 25 92 88 19 50Step II : 10 20 92 88 10 50Step III: 10 20 90 80 10 50Step III is the final step. Clearly in this example, the unit’s digits of the left most and right most number are simultaneously being subtracted from the numbers themselves. This is followed by the number to the right of the left most one, and to the left of the right most one.TIPS ABOUT NUMBER OF STEPS1. If there are ‘n’ words/digits in the input then at most ‘n-1’ steps are required to rearrange it completely.2. Number of words/digits arranged until the present step is greater than or equal to the present step number.3. If input is not given we cannot determine the previous step from given step number or we cannot determine input from given step number.Race Institute, HyderabadTags :Alligation and MixtureAlligation And MixtureApril-2020April-2020August-2020August-2020AveragebitbankbitbankBit BankBlood RelationsBlood RelationsCloze TestCloze TestCoding – DeCodingCoding – DeCodingComprehensionDecember-2020Direct and Indirect SpeechDirect And Indirect SpeechDirectionsDownloadEnglish LanguageError Detection in Specific WordsError Detection In Specific WordsExams InformationGeneral AwarenessGeneral Awareness-1General Awareness-2General Awareness-3General Awareness-4General Awareness-5IBPSIBPS - SPECIALIST OFFICERSIBPS SPECIALIST OFFICERSImportant DatesImportant DatesImp Questions - AnswersInput - Output SequenceJobsJuly-2020June-2020June-2020Language partlessonLessonMarch-2020May-2020May-2020MensurationMensurationModel papersNovember-2020Number SeriesOctober-2020Percentagespreparation planingPrevious PapersProfit & LossProject workPuzzle TestQuantitative AptitudeRatio and ProportionRatio And ProportionReasoningSeating ArrangementSeating ArrangementSeptember-2020Simple and Compound InterestSimple And Compound InterestSimplificationsSPECIALIST OFFICERSSpecial StoriesSports TermsSports TermsStatements and AssumptionsStatements And AssumptionsStudy MaterialSyllogismSYLLOGISMSTime and DistanceTime And DistanceTime & Workఇంగ్లిష్ లాంగ్వేజ్‌ఇంగ్లీష్ లాంగ్వేజ్ఉద్యోగాలుఐబీపీఎస్ఐబీపీఎస్ స్పెష‌లిస్ట్ ఆఫీస‌ర్స్‌ఐబీపీఎస్ - స్పెష‌లిస్ట్ ఆఫీస‌ర్స్‌క్వాంటిటేటివ్ ఆప్టిట్యూడ్‌జ‌న‌ర‌ల్ అవేర్‌నెస్‌డౌన్‌లోడ్‌నమూనా ప్రశ్నపత్రాలునిర్మాణాత్మక మూల్యాంకనంపరీక్ష సమాచారంపాత ప్రశ్నపత్రాలుప్రత్యేక కథనాలు‌ప్రిపరేషన్ విధానంభారత రాజ్యాంగ నిర్మాణంభారత రాజ్యాంగం -పరిణామ క్రమంభాషాంశాలురీజ‌నింగ్రీజ‌నింగ్స్టడీమెటీరియల్స్పెష‌లిస్ట్ ఆఫీస‌ర్స్‌TIME AND WORK1.
