There is currently a vacancy for a Community Connector within the team.What is a Community Connector? It’s a key part of the service where we connect the people we support with any opportunity, service or activity in their local community that helps them stay resilient, gain knowledge and skills, and stay more independent. Many people we support are socially excluded and struggle to know how to access opportunities available to them. The aim is to help educate and empower people to gain the help they need in the community rather than returning to longer term support services. Being able to be an active part of their community or just even know where to go to get something done – e.g. joining a social group - is a positive step in staying independent and well.The Moving Forward Community Connectors research, build connections and maintain relationships with a wide range of projects, services and organisations within the area that they work and the wider county. From this resource of information we can support people to begin their journey – whatever that might be. This could include becoming a volunteer, looking for training, making new friends – or learning new skills such as how to navigate the benefits system successfully, how to use the internet effectively or set up an email account - the list is endless. The skill of the community connector is to build interest, motivation and confidence in the person to create a better life for their future.We work with people individually or in small groups to explore how they can build their confidence, together with skills and knowledge that will help them find a route to their own personal goals.We are looking for an enthusiastic and committed person who can help people find their own solutions and aid them in planning a way forward. The successful candidate should be able to assess service users’ needs and offer viable options in a positive and safe way. The ability to design and deliver short, well planned and fun activities that engage socially excluded people is a must. The role will also advise and support core MF keyworkers to identify socially inclusive options for the people they support. The post holder would be expected to help recruit volunteer peer mentors and assist in their training and development. There is training available to achieve a Level 3 Award in Education and Training (RQF) qualification within 12 months. The post holder must have a current driving licence and access to a car.What we offer: Life Assurance, Pension (up to 4% matched by FHA), Enhanced Maternity, Paternity and Adoption Benefits, Additional Annual Leave Purchase Scheme, Employee Assistance Programme, Learning programmes tailored to suit different roles and services, Health Cash Plan.Framework supports all employees to achieve a better work/life balance.
