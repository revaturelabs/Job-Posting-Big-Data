When you visit your patients, instead of going from room to room or bed to bed, you are taking a drive to reach them from house to house”Dr Mohamed Rasheed, MB Chb, FRACGP“The work can be surprising sometimes. This is one of the more rewarding aspects of the job. The demographic between the patients you see in the clinic during the day and those you see after hours is usually quite different too, which adds to the diversity of your experience, and makes for a better, more well-rounded Doctor.”Dr Jomini Cheong, MBBS, BPHARM, BCOMMeet our doctors and read about their after hours doctor experience.General PracticeFAQs for GPsPractice registrationUpdate Practice detailsSpecial patient reportsUrgent Care Medicine CPD TrainingPractice feedbackTerms and conditionsAged Care FacilitiesBook doctor consultation for facilitiesFAQs for aged care facilitiesAged care feedbackGeneral PracticeFAQ for GP'sPractice RegistrationUpdate Practice DetailsSpecial Patient ReportsOrder Patient Information MaterialsPractice FeedbackTerms and ConditionsAged CareFAQ for Aged Care FacilitiesAged Care FeedbackOrder Aged Care MaterialsLocationsCapital citiesMelbourneSydneyBrisbaneAdelaidePerthCanberraTerms of UsePrivacy PolicySocial PolicyAffiliates and Useful LinksSite MapLocationsRegional citiesSheppartonIpswichToowoombaSunshine CoastGold CoastLauncestonNSW Central CoastNewcastleGeelongPatient resourcesPatient information sheetLate night pharmaciesList your pharmacyContact usMedia enquiriesWorking with usBlogTerms of UsePrivacy PolicySocial PolicyICT Use PolicyAffiliates and Useful LinksSite Map© National Home Doctor"
