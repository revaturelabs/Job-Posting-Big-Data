Great team of professionals - Salary $80K + SuperApply NowFarah has always been extremely helpful and professional. She has integrity and I can rely on her recommendations. - David Allen , Telehealth Solutions AustraliaConnie worked with me when I was a graduate trying to find direction. Connie became the reason why I ventured into Occupational Rehabilitation and has continued to be a valued mentor and a professional I trust. - Saranyae Manisegaran , Advanced Personnel ManagementRenee was of great assistance in finding me a job in the Occupational Rehabilitation sector. Being new to this industry, Renee recognized my transferable skills and was able to on-sell these to an employer who subsequently hired me! Renee had great insight into my skills and knows the industry intimately, which really helped. - Dianna Seychell , ACERFarah demonstrates a strong level of understanding, connections and capability within the broad personal injury sector. I have found her very proactive, personable and service-orientated. She is committed to working with her clients to deliver a strong human resource outcome for her clients. - Ross Baker , eReportsConnie was able to organise a meeting with an employer the day after I got in touch with her, and facilitated an offer within a matter of days. I would recommend Connie to professionals at any stage in their career who are looking to work with a highly competent professional, and an incredibly compassionate human being. - Saranyae Manisegaran , Advanced Personnel ManagementI was a recent graduate contemplating entering the occupational rehab sector but did not know where to turn. One email to Connie, Renee and Farah and my candidate profile was created and sent to numerous rehab organisations. The following day I received a request to interview and was offered the position the following day. I was cautious in my approach to working in this area but the team at MediJobs offered unbiased advice as to what each company could offer me as new graduate. The team at Medijobs work to find the perfect match between their available candidates and their employers. If I could offer one piece of advice it would be to get in contact with MediJobs if you are even slightly unsure of what the landscape looks like within the occupational rehabilitation sector. Farah, Connie, and Renee are there to discuss with you what you want in a job and what you might want to achieve one, five, ten, or even 15 years down the track and help you navigate your future now. Give MediJobs a call, you won't regret it. - Joshua Riza , Candidate1300 905 373info@medijobs.comCopyright Â©Medijobs Australia 2021Leaders in National Health Recruitment"
