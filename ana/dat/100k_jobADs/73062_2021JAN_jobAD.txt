Count on us to deliver the most relevant information during home or business purchases and sales.We look forward to working with you!TestimonialsMike and his team are spectacular. We had a PSE contractor out to install a sewer clean-out so they could verify there was no cross bore between our gas and sewer line. This work was being provided free by PSE. The contractor tried to up-sell us to the tune of $6500. Being that it was a new home, albeit original sewer lines, we were skeptical. We were being forced to decide quickly if we wanted to close the excavation hole or proceed with additional work the next day at the $6500 price point. That's when we called Mike, the Sewer Inspector. Mike had done the sewer scope on our home last year when we made the purchase. Mike jumped into action and came out here to verify if anything had changed from the scope he performed last year. Nothing had, which confirmed our suspicion that someone was trying to pull the wool over our eyes. We will have Mike and his team out any time there is a sewer inspection related issues. We recommend you do the same.	Sarah MitchTestimonialsSewer Inspector was awesome. He sent appointment reminders and showed up on time completely prepared. He immediately got to work looking for access points, identifying areas of interest and explaining all aspects of my sewage system to me. By the time he was complete, he put my concerns about the property to rest and explained how my system worked and what I could do to improve it. I had a full analysis and written inspection within a matter of hours. They will do all my homes now!	Antonio CrawfordTestimonialsI have had both Mike and Kyle inspect multiple properties for myself and clients. They are on time, knowledgeable and honest. Unlike many other companies, they do NOT conduct repair work. You get an honest assessment of what is going on, video, photos and a report. You can then take those items and find a contractor to do any necessary work. I have used another company to do sewer scope work in the past and they would upsell expensive repairs or replacements as addons. What you get here is a honest assessment of what's going on!
