Love working with Jon, so chilled and interesting, great coffee and an ideal ear to bounce ideas off! This time it was with the company of Luke Moore. I‚Äôve worked with Luke on a couple of occasions on Operation Lightfoot projects and he has many hats but in this situation it was as Cellist, Cellist to contribute and weave some dark, beautiful string tones to 2 of my songs. The songs most fitting for this ‚Äì Riches to Rags and Say Everything Do Nothing. It‚Äôs exciting for me to hear an instrument I don‚Äôt play adding sprinklings to my songs. Strings have such a powerful sound and I came away from the studio very happy. So, amidst conversations about zombies, Crystal Maze, Obstacle Races and coffee we put melodies and rhythms down to enhance, enhance, enhance. I had lots of fun being objective about my music and I‚Äôm now able to stand back from these songs and enjoy the craft. Being in the studio has to be one of my favourite ways to spend time, especially building my own songs. Onwards!NEXT UP NEWS!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I have another fantastic guest musician to announce on another song in the coming week for the album‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm going to sit on the details of this a tad longer but this song is on repeat on my phone at the moment and makes me smile üôÇ There will be details of this to come.On a slightly different note‚Ä¶I did my first ever 10k Obstacle race last month called Wolf Run. Loved it! So much fun, so much mud. More more more. This is my preferred way to defrag and get a body stretch and some fresh air, for this I‚Äôm grateful.Stay creativeJO xOctober 11, 2016 Albums, Collaborations, songwriting, studio, video Leave a comment Crosstown StudiosJon LawtonLuke MooreOperation LightfootSharkssongwritingstudio / album mixing pt. 1 / videosThe last few weeks have been inspiring‚Ä¶Album recording/mixing pt. 1There‚Äôs a lovely list of 12 songs all ready to make up my next album. I‚Äôve been patient this time round and have opted for letting this music marinate, sitting with it, making tweaks. I now have 8 songs pretty much recorded with some sprinklings from other artists to add to the mix and so a couple of weeks ago I paid a visit to Jon Lawton at the new premises of Crosstown Studios in Liverpool for his expert ears and studio skills‚Ä¶.with Jon at Crosstown Studios, LiverpoolThe feedback was great, the coffee was flowing and I came away feeling very excited and like I can move on to my next chapter‚Ä¶ watch this space, this thing has wings!Operation Lightfoot‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Last year I recorded a song with Operation Lightfoot called Sharks, I love this song, it‚Äôs moody and dark and comforting. Lots of strings. Perfect. We wrote the song together and I‚Äôve been excited for when we release it. This is now getting closer and we are currently story-boarding a video to go with it. This will hopefully be out by the end of the year üôÇKeep an eye on my website / social media for updates!Until thenJo xOctober 26, 2015 October 26, 2015 Collaborations, Music, video Leave a comment Bay TV LiverpoolCrosstown StudiosJon LawtonLuke MooreOperation LightfootOperation Lightfoot: studio times & Bay TV2 fab things to sing about today!Amazing studio time was had last Friday with Luke Moore and Jon Lawton at Crosstown Studios Liverpool. We began the recording of our song ‚ÄòSharks‚Äô for the Operation Lightfoot project. For this we decided I would be kept away from the guitar, so, guitar skills are by Luke, my vocals and harmonica are currently in place in this dark little number. The thing that has MOST excited me about this is the strings. THE STRINGS. I can‚Äôt wait to share this with everyone once it‚Äôs finished!ANDLast month I went along to visit Bay TV Liverpool and recorded a live session of 3 songs (Riches to Rags / Graze / Chopping Wood) in their TV studio.
