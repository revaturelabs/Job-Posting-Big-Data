"Why women won't earn a penny for the rest of this yearJump to navigationWhy women won't earn a penny for the rest of this yearEqual Pay Day falls on November 9 this year, marking the day that women essentially stop earning relative to average men's salariesBy Lauren Davidson 09 November 2015 • 08:21 amMade in Dagenham depicted the 1968 Ford workers' strike for equal pay Credit: Photo: Susie AllnuttThe difference in average salaries earned by men and women in the UK means that women effectively stop getting paid on Monday November 9 while men continue to receive salary for the rest of the year, campaigners say.In pictures: 14 ways to visualise the gender pay gapThe average female full-time worker in the UK earns 14.5pc less than her male counterpart – or 85.5p for every £1 earned by a man.That means that, relative to men, women effectively are not paid a penny for the final 52 days of this year.The average hourly pay of a full-time female worker is £14.39 per hour, compared to £16.77 for men, according to the Office for National Statistics.Happy Equal Pay Day! Look around work today, could you continue for the rest of the year without women? Answer: no. Solution: pay them more.— Brogan Driscoll (@Brogan_Driscoll) November 9, 2015#EqualPayDay -if we had a pound for every time we were told we didn't need feminism, we'd have 85p each time! #GenderPayGap— Dr Lisa Cameron MP (@lisacameronsnp) November 9, 2015The Fawcett Society, the women’s equality charity behind the “this is what a feminist looks like” t-shirt that political leaders and celebrities sported last year, has dubbed this day Equal Pay Day to draw attention to the gap between average men's and women's salaries.Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband wore the \"feminist\" t-shirts last yearThis discrepancy has narrowed since last year, when the gender pay gap was at 15.7pc and Equal Pay Day fell five days earlier on November 4th.The gap in hourly earnings for men and women fell to an all-time low of 19.1pc in 2014, according to the ONS, having widened to 19.8pc the previous year.For full-time workers, the pay discrepancy narrowed from 10pc in 2013 to a record low of 9.4pc. Women between the ages of 22 and 30 in full-time employment now earn slightly more than their male colleagues, but the pay gap stretches above the average for women in their 40s and 50s.The Women and Equalities Committee recently launched an inquiry into how the government is tackling the gender pay gap for employees over the age of 40.Committe chair, former equalities minister Maria Miller, said: \"The measures already announced by the Government don’t target this group.\"We’ll be asking about barriers to promotion; recruitment and training; problems facing women in predominantly female sectors and non-professional roles – and much more. Our inquiry will make recommendations that will tackle the gender pay gap where it hits the hardest.\"The government recently launched legislation that will require big companies to publish how much they pay male and female employees, including bonuses.David Cameron called the gender pay gap \"a standing rebuke to our country\" and has said he wants to end it within a generation.The Fawcett Society said that, at the current rate of progress, it will take over 50 years to close the gap.Twitter IconFacebook IconWhatsApp IconEmail IconComment speech bubbleAdvertisementMore storiesTwitter IconFacebook IconWhatsApp IconEmail IconComment speech bubbleMore from The TelegraphMore storiesMartin Odegaard joins Arsenal on loan from Real MadridBy Telegraph Sport 27 Jan 2021, 11:48amLive Travel news latest: 'No scientific evidence' for quarantine hotelsBy Hazel Plush 27 Jan 2021, 11:48amLive Coronavirus latest news: UK risks being 'caught out' by new variant if 'me first attitude' is taken on vaccinationsBy Dominic Penna 27 Jan 2021, 11:48amLive Politics latest news: Boris Johnson to give Covid update as pressure mounts to reopen schools - watch PMQs liveBy Catherine Neilan 27 Jan 2021, 11:46amRed faces for Italian purists as 'cringe' officially added to lexicon by Florence language academyBy Nick Squires 27 Jan 2021, 11:45amLive Short-sellers feel the squeeze as GameStop fever strikes London – live updatesBy Louis Ashworth 27 Jan 2021, 11:42amNews website of the yearThe TelegraphCoronavirusNewsPoliticsSportBusinessMoneyOpinionTechLifeStyleTravelCultureSearch IconSubscribe now Free for one monthLog inSee all NewsUK newsUK news homeScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandWorld newsWorld news homeUSAEuropeMiddle EastAsiaAustralasiaAfricaLatin AmericaRoyalsRoyals homeThe QueenPrince PhilipPrince CharlesDuchess of CornwallPrince WilliamDuchess of CambridgePrince HarryDuchess of SussexMore...HealthDefenceScienceEducationEnvironmentInvestigationsInvestigations homeSignals NetworkContact usGlobal Health SecurityGlobal Health Security homeClimate & PeopleScience & DiseaseTerror & SecurityWomen & GirlsOpinion & AnalysisThe TelegraphBack to topFollow us on:Facebook iconInstagram iconTwitter iconSnapchat iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconContact usAbout usRewardsArchiveReader PrintsBranded ContentSyndication and CommissioningGuidelinesPrivacyTerms and ConditionsAdvertising TermsFantasy SportUK Voucher CodesBetting OffersModern Slavery© Telegraph Media Group Limited 2020"
