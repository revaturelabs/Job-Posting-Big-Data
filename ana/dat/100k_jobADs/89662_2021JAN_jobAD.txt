Her company produces about 16 tonnes of dried pineapple a year sold in many shops and supermarkets in the capital, Conakry, and other cities around the country. Recently, her company increased its production capacity substantially to improve its competitiveness in regional and international markets. Fatoumata also opened an organic restaurant to complete the production chain and she directly employs 15 women. The story of Fatoumata is one example of the many emerging job opportunities in West Africa’s food systems.Off-farm activities — a wealth of diverse job opportunitiesThe regional food economy, the biggest employer in West Africa, is projected to reach USD 480 billion in 2030 with the non-agricultural sector expected to represent 49% of the value added. As a result, demand for labour in off-farm activities mainly in urban areas — processing, marketing and other services such as food-away-from-home — is growing. These activities have the potential to generate decent and permanent jobs especially for youth and women. About 68% of all employed women work in the food economy and like Fatoumata, most of them operate in off-farm segments.The majority of these activities are informal as food supply chains are mostly in the “traditional or transitional” stage. This means they do not guarantee a safety net for workers. The COVID-19 crisis has shown that, more than ever, social protection for workers is vital. However, if there are not enough decent and formal jobs, it will be difficult to put in place sustainable social protection systems. Therefore, supporting the transition to modern food supply chains that can create more stable employment should be a priority for policy makers.Closing the financing gapTo install a local solar fruit-drying unit, Fatoumata received support from the Italian Food Safety Programme (PISA) and obtained an electric kiln from the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Programme (WAAPP) to increase her production capacity. But while Fatoumata’s initial investment of USD 260 helped start her business, it was not enough to acquire the equipment she needed to grow it. 40% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Africa identified access to finance as the primary factor constraining their growth. In Nigeria alone, working capital needs for agribusiness are estimated at between USD 4.6 and USD 6.5 billion per year. Several constraints curb agricultural financing. For banks, the primary reason is the lack of specialist knowledge on agriculture and agribusiness. Many do not have the skills to analyse an agribusiness plan or assess agricultural-related risks and many agribusinesses lack the adequate collateral and records required for getting a loan. Public initiatives, such as the Rapid Entrepreneurship Delegation fund (DER) in Senegal, that offer financing to entrepreneurs at different stages of their activity, can help to reverse the curve. The private sector, through blended finance, can contribute to the rapid transformation of off-farm activities with initiatives, such as the NIRSAL in Nigeria, to make funding available for SMEs that employ or are managed by women and youth.Developing skills and standardsWith a background in accounting, Fatoumata clearly has an education level that gives her the skills to manage a business. However, when it comes to operations — processing fruit, packaging and storage — are her employees sufficiently trained to do the job? In order to take advantage of the diverse job opportunities that are emerging in the off-farm sector and to support the transition to modern food supply chains, women and youth need to acquire the skills to make them more productive. Skills that are both soft (leadership, self-discipline, critical thinking, responsibility) and technical (business and financial management, technology, quality control, agronomy, nutrition). Many of these skills can be acquired through better access to basic education, technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and on-the-job training. Another challenge is certification. The growing off-farm sector needs to provide quality goods and services in order to be competitive locally and internationally and to reassure consumers that they have access to healthy food. Evidence from 41 African countries shows that manufacturing firms with an International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) certificate achieve 77% higher sales per employee, and certified services firms have 55% higher sales per employee. Like incubators that help start-ups to develop through coaching and training, policy makers should put in place financial support and advisory services to accompany the certification process of firms in the off-farm sector.Adopting an “ecosystem” approachSince the launch of her business, Fatoumata has bought more than 320 tonnes of fresh pineapple from farmers, creating a local economy by working with a variety of producers and women’s co-operatives. Adopting an “ecosystem” approach can improve the sustainability of the activities of the actors involved in production supply chains and guarantee job stability for women and youth. Connecting the supply and demand of agricultural products for better-integrated value chains is key. In practice, this means that farmers have secured markets for all or part of their crop production at the beginning of production cycles, and that processors and traders have provided all or part of their supplies. This approach has the advantage of avoiding significant crop losses for farmers and ensuring stable incomes over time. For processors, it is an opportunity to ensure the quality of crops by supporting farmers in their production processes, especially for exporters who target foreign markets.Addressing the challenges of financing, skills development and co-ordination can significantly contribute to the dynamism of off-farm activities and the creation of more decent jobs for women and youth, ensuring the emergence of more success stories like Fatoumata’s. Spatial factors also matter. Governments should create an enabling environment by providing basic infrastructure, creating the right market incentives, promoting inclusive agribusiness models, and supporting information and communications technologies that foster inclusive value chains.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)MoreClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...Post navigation← Post-COVID-19 Development and Global Governance: The Emerging Role of Science and TechnologyCôte d’Ivoire et Maroc : réformer la fiscalité pour assurer un financement durable de la santé →Search for:Follow this blogEnter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.Email Address:	FollowTagsAfrica Asia business China Coronavirus Covid-19 Development finance Development in Transition Education Employment Environment Finance Food security Gender, Women and Girls GFD Green transition Growth Health Immigration Jobs Latin America Migration SDGs SIGI Social Protection sustainable development Tax Trade West Africa WomenRecent PostsData innovation for migration: why now and how?COVID-19 and the Kafala system: protecting African female migrant workers in Gulf countriesMigration is a force for development (and vice versa): it’s time we tell this story rightProtecting migrant workers in the Gulf: don’t build back better over a poor foundationThree root causes of violence against women and how to tackle themArchivesArchives Select Month January 2021 (15) December 2020 (7) November 2020 (11) October 2020 (15) September 2020 (17) August 2020 (13) July 2020 (8) June 2020 (21) May 2020 (21) April 2020 (28) March 2020 (12) February 2020 (3) January 2020 (6) December 2019 (6) November 2019 (7) October 2019 (5) September 2019 (1) August 2019 (1) July 2019 (3) June 2019 (7) May 2019 (7) April 2019 (8) March 2019 (10) February 2019 (8) January 2019 (8) December 2018 (11) November 2018 (6) October 2018 (9) September 2018 (9) July 2018 (2) June 2018 (6) May 2018 (3) April 2018 (3) March 2018 (15) February 2018 (4) January 2018 (4) December 2017 (1) November 2017 (3) October 2017 (11) September 2017 (6) August 2017 (2) July 2017 (4) June 2017 (7) May 2017 (6) April 2017 (8) March 2017 (9) February 2017 (3) January 2017 (3) December 2016 (5) November 2016 (8) October 2016 (3) September 2016 (1) August 2016 (3) July 2016 (5) June 2016 (6) May 2016 (8) April 2016 (4) March 2016 (3) February 2016 (2) January 2016 (4) December 2015 (5) November 2015 (4) October 2015 (8) September 2015 (6) August 2015 (3) July 2015 (1) June 2015 (2) May 2015 (1) April 2015 (1) October 2014 (1)CategoriesCategories Select Category Africa (141) Asia (33) Building resilience (62) Civil Society (2) Country systems (2) Covid-19 (122) Data (14) Development finance (66) Development in Transition (11) Education (3) Employment (8) Food security (20) Français (27) Gender, Women and Girls (55) Green transition (33) Human Development (26) Humanitarian (4) Infrastructure (11) Latin America and the Caribbean (36) Least developed countries (4) Migration (25) Natural Resources (13) New social contract (56) ODA (5) Policy (123) Private Sector (14) Reviving international co-operation (28) SDGs (74) Security (10) Shifting wealth (2) SME (3) Social Protection (36) Trade (15) Undefined (3) Youth (17)OECD Insights BlogLinksOECD work on developmentOECD Development CentreOECD Development Assistance CommitteeOECD Development Co-operation DirectorateSahel and West Africa ClubOECD Gender PortalAfrica’s Development DynamicsLatin American Economic OutlookBlog at WordPress.com.OECD work on developmentOECD Development CentreOECD Development Assistance CommitteeOECD Development Co-operation DirectorateSahel and West Africa ClubOECD Gender PortalAfrica’s Development DynamicsLatin American Economic OutlookAdd your thoughts here...
