While it is true that there are some kinds of work that leave you at greater risk for injury or fatal workplace accidents, any job you work could theoretically put you at risk for injury or occupational illness.Jobs that people often think of as inherently safe, such as office work or customer service jobs, could be a major source of risk, particularly for those who stay in the same position for many years. Repetitive motion injuries, in particular, are a risk for anyone who performs the same job day after day, month after month.What are repetitive motion injuries?Also known as repetitive strain or stress injuries, repetitive motion injuries involve physiological damage that results from performing the same task over and over. Our bodies are incredible machines, but even the most well-maintained and well-designed machine will experience wear and tear.Whether you have to type for hours every day or find yourself lifting, twisting or gripping things for much of your shift, the potential exists for damage to the muscles, bones and connective tissues at the area where you repetitively move.How can you treat repetitive motion injuries?There have been advances in medical science that help people who deal with injuries from their jobs. From improved pain management options to better steroids and physical therapy, there are a host of treatments that can reduce pain, increase strength and improve range of motion after a repetitive motion injury.However, in most cases, the only sure way to reduce or eliminate such harm is to rest and avoid repetitive motions in the future. For some people, it may be possible to work with an employer to change their responsibilities so that they don’t have to do the same task all day, every day. For others, a complete change of career may be the only solution.Unfortunately, that could mean drastically reduced earning potential for those who can’t continue their intended career. On the positive side of things, workers’ compensation benefits can help protect you from the financial repercussions of reduced work ability after a repetitive motion injury.Medical benefits and disability benefits can help you copeFiling a claim for workers’ compensation medical benefits will ensure that you receive the care you need to recover from your injury. From physical and occupational therapy to corrective surgery, the medical benefits available through North Carolina workers’ compensation can cover the costs associated with your repetitive motion injury.If you have to take a break from work entirely, temporary disability benefits can defray the cost of losing your income. For those who do not fully recover after repetitive motion injuries, permanent partial disability benefits could also reduce the financial impact of changing careers later in life by paying you a portion of the difference in your wages now versus before your injury.FacebookTwitterLinkedInSearch for:CATEGORIESblog (4)Construction Workers' Accidents (35)ERISA (1)Firm News (4)Industrial Workers' Accidents (3)Insurance (2)Medical Malpractice (6)Motor Vehicle Accidents (136)Personal Injury (58)Social Security Disability (244)Traumatic Brain Injuries (4)Workers' Compensation (157)Workplace Accidents (45)Workplace Injuries (51)ARCHIVESARCHIVES Select Month January 2021 (7) December 2020 (6) November 2020 (9) October 2020 (12) August 2020 (1) April 2020 (7) March 2020 (6) February 2020 (6) January 2020 (7) December 2019 (7) November 2019 (4) October 2019 (8) September 2019 (6) August 2019 (6) July 2019 (7) June 2019 (6) May 2019 (7) April 2019 (6) March 2019 (6) February 2019 (7) January 2019 (7) December 2018 (5) November 2018 (6) October 2018 (9) September 2018 (5) August 2018 (10) July 2018 (5) June 2018 (9) May 2018 (10) April 2018 (9) March 2018 (8) February 2018 (8) January 2018 (12) December 2017 (15) November 2017 (11) October 2017 (15) September 2017 (14) August 2017 (15) July 2017 (15) June 2017 (13) May 2017 (19) April 2017 (14) March 2017 (17) February 2017 (16) January 2017 (11) December 2016 (6) November 2016 (10) October 2016 (9) September 2016 (11) August 2016 (11) July 2016 (8) June 2016 (8) May 2016 (7) April 2016 (11) March 2016 (9) February 2016 (9) January 2016 (10) December 2015 (10) November 2015 (9) October 2015 (9) September 2015 (9) August 2015 (7) July 2015 (7) June 2015 (8) May 2015 (9) April 2015 (7) March 2015 (7) February 2015 (9) January 2015 (6) December 2014 (9) November 2014 (8) October 2014 (10) September 2014 (7) August 2014 (7) July 2014 (10) June 2014 (9) May 2014 (8) April 2014 (10) March 2014 (4) February 2014 (5) January 2014 (9) December 2013 (7) November 2013 (9) October 2013 (9) September 2013 (6)RECENT POSTSHow to tell if you might qualify for punitive damages in your personal injury caseAre you challenged or perplexed by the ERISA disability claims process?What do I do about Social Security retirement benefits if I am getting SSD payments?Is distracted driving more or less dangerous than drunk driving?See What Our Clients SayRobert Whitlow was awesome.
