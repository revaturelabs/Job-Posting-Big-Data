It’s not something that you usually think about when you’re having sex with a stranger. Still, a lot of people are going to want to do it. That means that it’s in your best interests to know what you’re doing. If you want to be the best at giving blowjobs, then all you have to do is follow a few simple tips. They’ll elevate your mouth game to the next level.Nothing grows in a desertThe very first thing that you need to realize is that nothing is going to grow in a desert and that extends to penises. Your mouth needs to be wet. You can never have too much saliva in your mouth. If you feel like you’re drooling all over the place, then you’re in a good position. Just let it flow and the guy you’re with is going to lover everything you do. It feels much better than a girl who only has a little bit of spit to go around. Do whatever it takes to work it all up.Use your handsBlowjobs aren’t all about the mouth. You need to be using your hands as much as you can. Use one right in front of your mouth to give him a blowjob/handjob combo. Use the other to play with his balls for him. If you manage to do it the right way, you’re going to be the girl he thinks about when he remembers the perfect blowjob. That’s what’s going to keep him coming back to you over and over again and It’s going to make him blow faster than anything else on the planet.Take the load somewhereNaturally, you’re having sex with a stranger. That means you might not want to swallow his load and that’s fine. Just make sure you get it out somehow. Jerk him off if you have to, just don’t leave him to finish himself off. No guy has ever enjoyed that. If you start the blowjob then you have to finish it. Just make sure you aim it away from your eyes. Nothing burns like a fresh load of hot cum when it hits your eyes. Look away and let him do his thing and you’ll be the queen of his blowjobs.← First Time Anal Hook up → Using the Internet to Learn your Kinks – Part 1Search for:Recent PostsHow to get a No Strings BlowjobHow to spank your Hook upHow to Hook up at a PartyHow to tell if a Coworker wants to Hook upSeducing an Older WomanCategoriesHookup DestinationsHookup HorrorsHookup LifestyleHookup StoriesHookup TipsUncategorized© 2021	Hookup OnlinePowered by WordPress	To the top ↑	Up ↑"
