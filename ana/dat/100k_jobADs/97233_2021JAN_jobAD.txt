"Republican Club of Greater St. Augustine: \"NO\" on 3; Jobs Returning in FloridaRepublican Club of Greater St. AugustineTuesday, September 22, 2020\"NO\" on 3; Jobs Returning in FloridaRPOF Chairman Joe Gruters recently reinforced the importance of voting NO on Amendment 3, which would create open primary elections in Florida:I cannot emphasize enough the importance of voting NO on Amendment 3 to maintain the integrity of the Republican Party in Florida. The Amendment destroys Republicans’ ability to choose our candidate for office and could leave only two Democrat options on a ballot in the General Election. Share widely the importance of this NO vote on Amendment 3.(See posting below for a link to more info on this amendment.)In positive news, the Department of Economic Opportunity announced that jobs are coming back in Florida after the corona virus hit:The three industries losing the most jobs from February to April 2020, gained back 448,300 jobs from April to August 2020: leisure and hospitality at 278,500 jobs, 50.6 percent of those lost; professional and business services at 73,200 jobs, 48.5 percent; and education and health services at 96,600 jobs, 72.9 percent.Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestNewer Post Older Post HomeNext meetingDate: February 2021 (date to be announced)Program: To be announcedLocation: Grower's Alliance Cafe, 322 Anastasia Blvd., St. AugustineFollow by EmailContact UsSend us an email:RepubClubGSA@gmail.comBy post:P.O.
