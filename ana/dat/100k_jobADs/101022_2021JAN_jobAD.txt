Very friendly. The uShip added fees are very misleading. I would definitely use uShip again based on my experience with the actual moving company - they were great! I will just keep in mind the added fees uShip tacks on when requesting quotes in the future. They make it look like it is a deposit towards the delivery company and there is a 'small' uShip fee - but the reality is the up front fees all go to uShip.- Eric A.Ready to Ship your Stuff?Household GoodsChange >Category:- Select a Category - Household Goods Business & Industrial Moving Vehicles Boats Food & Agriculture Special Care Items Passengers Junk Pets LTL Freight Motorcycles Heavy Equipment Small Packages Horses & Livestock FTL Freight Other LTL Freight European FTLSelect a Sub-Category Furniture Home Electronics Appliances Arcade Equipment Sporting Equipment Household Plants Other Household Goods Special Care Outdoor EquipmentOrigin:Look UpDestination:Look UpEmail address:More Household Goods StoriesCourt TilesTrès bonne expérience d'ac...Job well done!!!mein erstes uship :-)transport armoire ancienneUsing uSHIP Saves Money an...Couch Movers NeededShipment to Upstate NYGreat Experience Shipping ...lucky to have found UshipRead More AboutuShip Household Goods StoriesuShip Business & Industrial ...uShip Household & Office Mov...uShip Vehicles StoriesuShip Boats StoriesuShip Food & Agricultural Go...uShip Special Care Items StoriesuShip Passengers StoriesuShip Junk StoriesuShip Pets StoriesuShip Less Than Truckload St...uShip Motorcycles & Power Sp...uShip Heavy Equipment StoriesuShip Small Packages StoriesuShip Horses & Livestock StoriesuShip FTL Freight StoriesuShip Other StoriesuShip LTL Freight StoriesuShip European FTL StoriesCost to ShipVehiclesMotorcyclesFurnitureFreightBoatsHeavy EquipmentCompanyCareersPressBlogCategoriesUnited StatesCanadaUnited KingdomAustraliaIndiaDeutschlandFranceNederlandEspañaMéxicoSouth AfricaÖsterreichBrasilArgentinaChilePerúColombiaVenezuelaCopyright © 2020, uShip Inc. and its licensors.
