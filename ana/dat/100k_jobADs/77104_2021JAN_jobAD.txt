For some, advancement never comes even if they are promised it will. Morale in the call center at Physicians mutual is usually at an all time low. But There are great things about the company and that is the people. Most of the people you come in contact will will always be friendly and help. You can also never go wrong with the training team, they are some of the hardest working people there in my opinion.Was this review helpful?Yes5No1ReportShareTweetShareCopy link1.0Job Work/Life BalanceCompensation/BenefitsJob Security/AdvancementManagementJob CultureBad company to work for treated poorly on every level.Teleservices Representative (Former Employee) - 2600 Dodge Street - January 13, 2020The worst job I have ever had. Do not have one good thing to say. Do not waste your time. You will hate your life. Even the customers you talk to are crazy and you can hardly understand what they are saying. It was the most awful experience I have ever had.Was this review helpful?Yes1No1ReportShareTweetShareCopy link4.0Job Work/Life BalanceCompensation/BenefitsJob Security/AdvancementManagementJob Culturehigh paced job with lots of benefitsInbound Teleservices Representative (Former Employee) - Omaha, NE - August 2, 2017the hardest part of the job is learning the different parts of the insurance policies and educating yourself on insurance and Medicare. The job itself is easy once you get use to the material. The training is incredibly fast paced. Management could use improvement in the dept i worked for. I learned a lot about insurance in general including Medicare. It definitely taught me key things to look for and pay attention to in the future.Was this review helpful?Yes5No1ReportShareTweetShareCopy link2.0Job Work/Life BalanceCompensation/BenefitsJob Security/AdvancementManagementJob CultureDifficult work environment and little interaction with co-workersInbound Teleservice Representative (Former Employee) - Omaha, NE - March 8, 2017This customer service position was rewarding in the aspect of customer interaction, but it was arduous for time management and adherence to performance metrics. The quality standards were achievable and fair, but the call volume was heavy, and the necessity for documentation of calls while on the phone with the insured to keep the average after-call time to 27 seconds or less, made it necessary for one to be an excellent multi-tasker. The position was part-time, and only the top performers for both quality and quantity were given an opportunity to go to full-time employment.ProsInteraction with customersConsHeavy call volume and rigorous time-management metricsWas this review helpful?Yes9No1ReportShareTweetShareCopy link4.0Job Work/Life BalanceCompensation/BenefitsJob Security/AdvancementManagementJob CultureThis was a very busy place and the campus was beautiful...Teleservices Representative (Former Employee) - Omaha NE - September 1, 2015I work the phones assisting members with their claims and understanding their policies. (Medicare Supplement). I learned how to plan for my retirement. Management was moved around a lot like most call centers. The co-workers were helpful as much as possible being on the phone.

I have learned more about life, health and dental insurance by working at this company. My management is good but not great. I love working with my coworkers as they are all very nice and help out a lot. The hardest part of my job is talking to customers who are in such a hurry or don't want to receive calls from us that they can be rude. The most enjoyable part is when I make a customer's day so much easier by letting them know that everything with their policy is going to be okay.ProsFriendly coworkers, pay, and hoursConsNo health insurance, not many PTO hoursWas this review helpful?Yes59No8ReportShareTweetShareCopy link5.0Job Work/Life BalanceCompensation/BenefitsJob Security/AdvancementManagementJob CultureWonderful Work Place!Advanced Product Teleservices Representative (Former Employee) - Omaha, NE - January 13, 2014Flexibility shifts.
