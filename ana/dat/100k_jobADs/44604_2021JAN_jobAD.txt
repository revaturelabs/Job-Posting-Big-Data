I’d be willing to bet you have- at least once- even if you’re not willing to admit it. I’ve concluded that the real reason runners go the distance is so they can enjoy as much fresh bread & cookies as they want without having to worry about over-indulging. Endorphin rush? Nah, it’s the desire for fresh bagels. You can admit it. I won’t tell.Thanks to our awesome neighbors, we here at Tarheel Paper Company get the luxury of being able to smell fresh baked doughnuts in the air when we enter & exit our building, so I thought this week we’d highlight products for what is obviously one of my favorite businesses: the bakery.We carry a vast amount of products for the bakery industry for all facets of the job: janitorial products to keep the bakery (& the baker’s hands) clean, apparel to keep the food clean, and packaging supplies to keep the delicious treats fresh & damage-free until they get to the consumer’s kitchen.Apparel:HairnetsGlovesBeard CoversJanitorial:Can LinersWet MopsWipersE2 SoapsTowel & TissueOven CleanerBleachPackaging:FDA Approved PolybagsZiplock & Slider BagsPan LinersBakery Wax PaperTwist TiesLabelsBoxesBread BagsShrink FilmContainersBread is considered a staple food, and we deliver the staples the baker needs to prepare & package the bread safely.
