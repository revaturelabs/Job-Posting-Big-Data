Or, are you concerned about keeping your job while competing against a younger generation?If so, you’re not alone. A question I’ve gotten a lot in the past couple of weeks is what can the older generation of workers do to protect their career & job search during a time of crisis.“The truth is, if you’re over 50, and you’ve decided in your mind that it’s all age discrimination and there’s nothing that you can do, that’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. That’s exactly what’s going to happen. But I know there’s lots of you that don’t want to believe that, and there’s lots of you who don’t want to be angry anymore.”In this episode, I talk about how the coronavirus pandemic affects workers over 50 years old, and what you can do about it.Work It Daily’s free resources: https://www.workitdaily.com/resourcesWork It Daily membership information: https://workitdaily.lpages.co/pricing/Want To Hear More?
