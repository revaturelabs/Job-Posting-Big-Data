The region’s economy lost 400 nonfarm jobs but finished the year with an average of 1,150 more jobs than 2017. The net annual totals will be available in the January labor market reports.December’s employment was down by 1,980 people, and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%. Unemployment dropped because there were 2,130 fewer people in the labor force. The annual employment monthly average improved by 2064 people while stronger hiring brought an additional 1,315 people into the labor force.The preliminary, non-adjusted annual total shows the seven-county region was close to the pre-recession recovery level. It had 417 fewer nonfarm jobs in 2018 than it did in 2008. A clearer picture will come with next month’s adjustment of the numbers.Most of the December and preliminary annual report shows an improved Tri-Cities labor market. But there are some soft spots.Nonfarm job trendFor example.
