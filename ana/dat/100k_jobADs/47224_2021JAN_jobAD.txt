The 31 wins the team has had in the past two years is the best they've done in two decades.15 March, 2010 12:12ferschitz said...http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/oregonstate.aspYeah, yeah, Craig Robinson IS Michelle Obama's brother and is brother-in-law to BHO.But of course: this is all a big fat LIE... why am I so unsuprised by that? Bullshit of the finest order set out there to gin up fake outrage by bigoted contards.Where oh where are the conservative trolls who wish to come forward and post here explaining THIS?? OR am I just being a mean, nasty LIEbrul or something to be audacious enough to point out the ongoing LIES that pour forth daily in right wing forwards?? OOOOPS, guess I'm \"insensitive\" and not \"politically correct\" enough and should have said instead: why these fine conservatives are just reality and truth CHALLENGED!15 March, 2010 12:19gruaud said...\"According to an unnamed source...\"And the house of cards falls again.15 March, 2010 12:48Daft Greg said...Wow, he really is her brother! So the whole thing must be true! Typical right-wing concept of \"evidence\".15 March, 2010 17:40john_m_burt said...Coach Robinson is a local celebrity here in Corvallis, but I never heard this silly rumor from anyone locally.16 March, 2010 09:41Anonymous said...What utter crap. They just extended his contract for another 2 years, citing the fact that he had the best two year record at the school in almost 20 years.16 March, 2010 11:43Hooray4US said...As some recent posters will notice: reality has a definite liberal bias, and conservatives aren't interested in being the slightest bit factual. They just make up stuff to suit their twisted wingtarded fantasies.Shorter: they LIE. constantly.16 March, 2010 17:02Post a CommentNewer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)Welcome to the Right-Wing Forward MuseumMyRightWingDad.net is a museum dedicated to following the course of American history through a unique lens -- the emails \"Red-America\" forwards worldwide.
