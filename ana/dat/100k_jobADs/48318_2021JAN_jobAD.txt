"SCS Software's blog: Fantasy Paint Jobs Pack DLC for ETS2Thursday, July 24, 2014Fantasy Paint Jobs Pack DLC for ETS2The Fantasy Paint Jobs Pack DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2 has just been made available for purchase on Steam.There was some grumbling that we did a time-limited exclusive deal for this new DLC before actually releasing it at large, depriving the fan-base of the chance to get it immediately, too. To make up for this sin at least a little bit, we are launching it with a short but very generous 80% discount!Published by SCS Software at 7/24/2014 09:03:00 PMEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestTags: DLC, Euro Truck Simulator 2199 comments:Mike Theunissen July 24, 2014 at 9:09 PMNice job, SCS.Now let's concentrate on the new trucks, eh? :DReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous July 24, 2014 at 9:11 PMAMAZING!!! 0,40€ Thanks!

YEAH, this is a really good made simulator (nowadays much more arcade) , relative to the small group of ppl that represent SCS. therefore, you should have PATIENCE, they work hard, they are not so rich as some of you think, need to monetize their work (they chosed paint jobs but in my opinion sets of trucks and trailers were better profit capital)...I like that SCS tries to listen our complains, I don't like when they ignore a very good idea, that isn't so hard to put in practice... this game should and could be more realistic... hope to become someday...

In my opinion, it would be better to release only one or max two updated articles one/two days before releasing a patch, DLC, and so on...in such a way people won' t be bored, illuded, etc.BTW, I' m not one of those bored guys because I' m still playing the 1.10 and using tons of nice mods (the best one is the tandem trucks pack, and I wanna say many thanks to Mr. Flemming!!! I hope one day he will be able to make rigid bodies and trailers, if you guys will activate a second articulated point in the game engine, or maybe now I' m falling in a fantasy world, plenty of dreams!). I' m playing on many nice maps, separately using , again, tons of nice mods and until promods, tsm, msheavyalex won' t release the updated maps, plus many new other mods for 1.11, I ' ll play the 1.10. Rather, I prefer waiting (I hope to be still alive!!!) for a new DLC well worked, and pay money (as train simulator is doing, I know, it' s not the best example I' m making!), instead of getting free updates that, in my opinion, are really poor updates.I understand that your strategy right now should be (and maybe I could be wrong) increasing the number of players, but what about the old people that ' s waiting for more stuff, improvements, etc?!!! And of course, only you there know how' s going on there, your needs, working hours, money, necessary time for new developments, etc, but concentrate in bigger \" updates\" in new DLCs more often, damn it!!! I' m 34 old right now!!! I don' t wanna play the next DLC at 40, or maybe a new ETS at 75years!!!One more thing, it would be possible to follow your progresses in time by posting them?!!!

How far does this to make only 2 countries? because so far it seems to me all the same, have not seen any changes, the AI is still dumb, lawn the same thing, same scenario, deserted streets without people like always, ie, did not see anything different, only bug in some trucks, as Renault Premium, is that red color light, Scania mirrors with Bug, you know ... I mean ... that leaves pacths, and the mods have to do it again, because I have mods version 1.10.x.. maps work .. how TSM, but with the new version 1.11 does not work, some mods of error, both the Mercedes is also vermelhado light in certain parts, I think that SCS did a game and would put some editor, could do ourselves, making the game ever better without bug ...
