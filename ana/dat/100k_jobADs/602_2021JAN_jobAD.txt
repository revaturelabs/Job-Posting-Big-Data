Here you will learn the skill of dialysis, but also be responsible for the nursing care of patients during their treatments. For example, we have patients on insulin drips, cardiac drips, patients with tracheostomies, chest tubes, etc. that you will be responsible for maintaining during that patient's dialysis treatment. You will provide intermittent hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and continuous renal replacement therapy for patients throughout the hospital becoming competent in all modalities.Join our team and you will work closely with nursing leadership and physicians, including a safety huddle each morning where nursing staff and nursing leadership identify any safety issues over the previous 24-hour period. A typical day in our dialysis unit is a 12-hour shift where you will treat patients on the unit or at the bedside. If you treat patients at the bedside you will be 1:1 but will be responsible for going to that patient to complete HD and hooking up our unique water system. Generally, two bedside treatments can be completed in one shift. If you are assigned to treat patients on the unit, you will have 2 patients per 1 nurse. There are usually 2 - 3 dialysis shifts per day, so you would be treating a total of 4 - 6 patients on a normal day.Benefits second to none.Relocation AssistancePension planGenerous PTOComprehensive health benefitsLoan forgivenessEducation reimbursementCommunity discountsChild care optionsLiving in Raleigh/DurhamU.S. News & World Report named Raleigh/Durham a Top 10 Best Place to Live.
