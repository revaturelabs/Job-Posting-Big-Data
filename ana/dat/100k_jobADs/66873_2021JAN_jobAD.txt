Unfortunately, this uncertainty has had a devastating impact on both the stock market and the everyday commerce that sustains the economy. Freelancers, drivers, hotel and restaurant workers now find themselves physically or legally barred from working. Not only service workers are affected; even people with desk jobs who are able to work from home might find themselves laid-off or furloughed as businesses reduce their payrolls in a bid to cut costs.With almost twenty million people unemployed, and an average of a million filing for unemployment every day for the last three weeks, one certainty within the great chaos of COVID-19 is that parents’ ability to fulfill child support obligations has changed. If you have been financially affected by the pandemic, we are here to help.
