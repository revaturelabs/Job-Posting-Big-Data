If you have limited space you may want to consider a truck-mounted pump. These come equipped with telescopic attachments that can be moved to fit the tightest of spaces.Any weight or access restrictions: Weight and access restriction information should be readily available before the project starts so that contractors can arrange their plant hire in advance.

While you cannot afford to compromise on quality, you could negotiate discounted rates with your concrete pump hire company. Many will offer reduced rates for longer hire periods or if you open a company account.
