Cause it is very easy to learn nowadays. You may have completed a course from some institute or maybe an online course. Generally what people expect is that after this course they will be like Digital Marketing Expert and some Digital Marketing Specialist. But, that‚Äôs not true. Right?If you have ever gone for an interview after doing any course you will know that just doing a course is not going to help you get a job. Generally, you can get an internship at most. That is if you know about Digital Marketing more than your course materials. But, it‚Äôs not impossible to get a direct job.Fear not ‚Äì Above situation is something which you may face if you don‚Äôt do what I am going to tell you. So, get ready to know what you have to do to get your first job after the course.Let‚Äôs start with why this happens.We all know that doing a course is not all the thing you need to get a job. Cause in course you will only learn about some basic stuff and when I say ‚Äúlearn‚Äù that means you will only know how things work in Digital Marketing. But, you won‚Äôt have any experience in doing those things.You may have learned about SEO. But, you haven‚Äôt done any actual SEO work for any website. You may have learned about email marketing but you haven‚Äôt sent any email to anyone. This is the thing which restricts you from getting your job. You don‚Äôt have any hands-on experience for any of the things you learned in your course.Now we know the Why part of our problem.You may ask ‚ÄúBut, What can I do?‚ÄùHere‚Äôs the thing you have to do. But, let me warn you first. These things are not easy to do.1) Decide which field you want to go with.The first thing you have to do before starting a journey is you have to decide where you want to go. Right? So, you have to decide what you want to do in digital marketing before doing any other things.Most of the courses cover all the things in digital marketing. Such as Search Engine Optimization, Search Engine Marketing, Email Marketing, Social Media Marketing, Facebook Ads, Google Ads and all. But, when you want to do a job you have to pick one from these things. It‚Äôs a good thing to learn about all of them. But, if you are finding a job in a good agency you have to pick one.Decide what you like the most and you will like to work and learn more about it. Take that particular topic.Now, you may think that I want to learn about everything. There‚Äôs nothing wrong in it. But, here we are talking about getting the first job just after your course and typically a course duration is not more than 4 months. You won‚Äôt be able to get experience in all of the things. So, it‚Äôs better to take things slow.2) Get Some ExperienceNow, this is the part where you would be spending more time and doing more hard work.After picking one thing from Digital Marketing you have to get some experience in that particular part. Suppose you want to go with SEO. You need to get experience in SEO. Basically, you have to do the actual SEO work for someone.Now you may have this question in mind that ‚Äúhow can I find a client?‚ÄùThe simple approach to this is ‚ÄúFree work‚Äù. First thing is to ask the businesses around your location and do SEO for them for FREE or Second thing if you have someone in the family who have a business website then it is simple. Just tell them that you want to help them in business with this SEO for their website so they can get more customers.That‚Äôs it. You have your first ever client for Digital Marketing. I have done the first thing asking business around my location and if you think it won‚Äôt work then you are wrong I convinced them in my first try. üôÇNow, after you got permission. Start doing work for them while doing your course apply all the things you learn from course.If you don‚Äôt want to ask people you can get your website/blog and do SEO for that. But, that won‚Äôt be related to any actual business. Which is less credible than doing SEO for an actual businessCreate your Blog for FREE with Blogger.This is not just for SEO you can try it for anything you want to get experience in.You have to do a little more work with this which is the next step. And don‚Äôt think it is not important just cause it‚Äôs little.3) Make a Case StudyNo matter what you are doing for them in SEO, SEM, SMM or whatever. You have to write down all the things you are doing for your first client and make a case study on how your work helped that particular business to get more customers or reach.A case study is very very important. When you go for an interview show them your case study. Don‚Äôt just tell them that you have done this and that instead show them what you have done. Case studies show, they don‚Äôt tell and that‚Äôs what people like.When you show them a case study then you are more likely confirmed for that job.Even if you don‚Äôt want to do the job and want to become a freelancer you must have this case study ready. If you show the prospect this case study you have 70% more chances of getting that deal.Don‚Äôt know how to make a case study?Your case study should include these 7 parts.1) Name (Headline)2) Background (Abuot Business)3) Objectives (What are the requirements?)4) Solution (How the objectives were achieved?)5) Results (How did it work?)6) Testimonial (Is client happy?)7) Call-to-action (CTA)Still need help?? Here‚Äôs an Example of a case study.
