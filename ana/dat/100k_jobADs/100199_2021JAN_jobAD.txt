He does not rule out a possible move in the future.Van Gaal said, “I want to work in the Premier League because that is the league I have not worked in yet. I want to coach here in the Premier League because I think Spain, Germany and England are the strongest competitions. That is an ambition and who knows.”On Tottenham’s approach he added, “Everybody knows it so I can admit it. I don’t do things in a double function.“You have to give an example to your players that they have to focus on the national team and that is my ambition also.“I have refused (the Tottenham job) but maybe there will come another chance. That is the difficulty with coaching. When you are free, then maybe there are no vacancies.“When you are working, then there are vacancies. It is always difficult. After the World Cup I shall retire or, if there is a Premier League club, I shall think about it.”Followadmin (9822 Posts)Follow @Footballoranje_ on TwitterShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...RelatedTags: louis van gaal, netherlands, TottenhamLeave a ReplyClick here to cancel reply.Name (required)E-Mail (required)Website (Optional)« Ola Toivonen set to sign for RennesEredivisie team of the week round 19 »Dutch Football News 24/7Follow our new Twitter accountMy TweetsFootball-Oranje is on YoutubeTop Posts & PagesWijnaldum decides to leave Liverpool for Barcelona	Vitesse down Emmen to put the pressure on Ajax	Ajax lose talented striker to Borussia Dortmund	Lang hits out at Ten Hag after Ajax exit	Eredivisie Predictions & Betting 20/21: Round 17	Ajax v Feyenoord: De Klassieker Match Preview	Feyenoord beat Dortmund to sign Senegalese attacker	Huntelaar must choose between Ajax and Schalke: \"They need me more\"	PSV win thriller against Sparta in snowy Rotterdam	Ajax edge out wasteful Feyenoord in De Klassieker	Privacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
