As a Digital Marketing Exec for 19yrs, my blog is about life outside the faux world of Social Media - it is about honesty, realness and an appeal to others that NO ONE has a perfect life, YET it can still be a perfectly happy life.I write as often as possible but sometimes creativity escapes me and pictures or things I find along my journey, will have to do‚Ä¶I write from my heart & don't often check up on grammar for my own posts so grammar police .... mmm you know.I am a tiny 5\"3 girl next; an ordinary girl living an extraordinary life.I am also an incredibly happy person (with the happy gene) but hey, we all have our issues; you will read about mine here, and if you need to chat drop me a line anytime jojobayvel@me.com.A little Bio on meI am a 37 -going on 14 or 40- year old girl living in Cape Town and of course‚Ä¶.limbo‚Ä¶ am I on the shelf or do I want to actually marry? I am incredibly fussy & believe in fairytales and forever after. Been proposed to 3 times said no as I want an always love...Typical Gemini‚Ä¶Princess & Tomboy!Lady and loud, love marketing, art, fashion, sport, Jesus, travel & most of all helping others - it's what makes me heart smile.I love comfort zones and adventure too? Crave travel, new people and places, never want to move?!?!?Will always love animals, my family and friends ‚Äì break-ups always result in me losing a dog!!!Feisty, stubborn yet soft hearted with a pretty hard outer cover!Crave love but bore easily‚Ä¶ Want & adore kids and to be happily married but dread monotony. Need freedom, space, music and time to breathe but thrive on others company‚Ä¶.‚ô•‚ÄùThank you so very much, for reading my posts & any part of my journey through life.Love Always,JoJoFind Stuff You May EnjoySearch for:Connect With Me Socially Through My JourneyFacebookTwitterInstagramLinkedInGoogleYouTubePinterestFollow An Ordinary Girl On An Extraordinary Journey Through Life on WordPress.comLife In PicsNo Instagram images were found.Follow My Journey Through LifeEnter your email address to follow this blog and receive Click And Follow My Journey Through Life.Email Address:	Join MeOthers Journeys I EnjoyOthers Journeys I EnjoyFollow Blog via EmailEnter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.Join 1,637 other followers	Email Address:	FollowWebsite Built with WordPress.com.Back to topAn Ordinary Girl On An Extraordinary Journey Through LifeAn Ordinary Girl On An Extraordinary Journey Through Lifemunro open studIoContemporary South African ArtHiking PhotographyCanadian Hiking PhotographyGraphiclinewebA Techno Blog about web design, internet, computers and technologyAdd your thoughts here...
