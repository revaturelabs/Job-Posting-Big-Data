Located just 12 miles south of Des Moines, the capital of Iowa, Simpson's picturesque 85-acre campus in Indianola is home to 1,127 full-time undergraduate students with more than 400 additional adult and graduate students at the Des Moines metro site.</p><p>The Simpson College trustees, faculty and staff are deeply committed to the mission of the College and believe that Simpson's considerable assets, in combination with a collective effort behind a unifying vision, will help Simpson thrive in the years ahead. The College acknowledges the challenges facing residential liberal arts colleges brought about by demographic and economic changes. Proactive approaches to balance the annual operating budget while actively growing enrollment will position the College to move forward in the coming years.</p><p><em>History</em></p><p>Founded by Iowa United Methodist Church in 1860 as Indianola Seminary, the school changed its name to the Des Moines Conference Seminary in September 1865. Two years later, the school was upgraded to Simpson Centenary College to honor Methodism's 19th-century most renowned bishop, Matthew Simpson (1811-1884), and to celebrate the centennial of American Methodism. In June 1885, Centenary was dropped from the name, and the institution has been Simpson College ever since.</p><p>Simpson's most noted alumnus, George Washington Carver, began his college education at Simpson College in the fall of 1890. After another college refused to admit him because he was black, Carver matriculated at Simpson, where he studied art and piano. His art teacher Etta Budd, seeing his talent for painting flowers and plants, encouraged him to study botany at Iowa State Agricultural College, where he received a bachelor's degree in agricultural science and a master of science degree in 1896. He went on to a successful career at the Tuskegee Institute, with which Simpson maintains a relationship. Simpson's Carver Science Center is named in honor of Dr. Carver.</p><p>Simpson College's highly regarded academic programs have been preparing students for coveted careers, competitive research programs and prestigious graduate schools. Backed by a rich liberal arts tradition, today's Simpson experience is defined by the many exceptional opportunities for learning both in the classroom and in the community. Simpson's curriculum is guided by five principles that will help students develop the skills and mindset needed to succeed in the ever-changing work environment of the 21st century.</p><p><em>Academics</em></p><p>Simpson's quality liberal arts education emphasizes academic excellence, community engagement, international experiences and success beyond the classroom. The college's 20 academic departments house 74 majors and minors, as well as three graduate programs, all of which provide students with the skills they need to succeed in a given field. The most in-demand programs include Business Management, Education, Exercise Science, Mathematics and the sciences. Newer majors include Sports Communication, Human Services, Social Justice Studies, Data Science and Health Services Leadership. The student-to-faculty ratio is 12:1, allowing access to faculty in the rigorous, yet supportive, learning environment. Simpson professors are dedicated to their fields of study and equally dedicated to teaching; along with Simpson's staff, they uphold Simpson's long-standing commitment to educating the whole person by nourishing the intellectual, spiritual, emotional, social, and physical dimensions of students' lives.</p><p>Simpson's general education curriculum focuses on high-impact educational practices such as undergraduate research, service learning, first-year experiences, and capstone courses in the major. It emphasizes areas of engagement linked to liberal arts modes of knowledge and embedded skills most valued by today's employers. The College operates on a 4-4-1 calendar year, which features a three-week May term for students to focus intently on one specific area of study and empowers students to take advantage of Simpson's many community partnerships and internships, as well as Study Abroad and Study Away. The College also offers summer terms for traditional and non-traditional students.</p><p>Simpson's First-Year Program, which helps ease students into their first-year at the college, is one of the best in the nation. According to <em>College and Character, </em>a national initiative of the John Templeton Foundation, Simpson is one of 60 colleges in the nation that offers students an exemplary program in the first year to develop moral character.</p><p><em>Co-Curricular Opportunities</em></p><p>Simpson offers many clubs and organizations that provide great leadership experiences for students. The school hosts more than 60 student clubs and organizations on campus. Some of the options for involvement include: Campus Activities Board, which brings national and local acts to campus and sponsors free entertainment on Friday and Saturday nights; student publications, including an award-winning newspaper, literary magazine and radio station; performance opportunities in theatre productions and music groups; student government; religious life community, which provides chances for vocational exploration, service trips and worship in many faiths; multicultural and international organizations that highlight new cultures and enhance diversity on campus; intramurals; and Greek life. Every year, students participate in Campus Day, an event where classes are put on hold and students participate in community service instead.</p><p>In addition, the Simpson College athletics program has a great tradition of success at the NCAA Division III level. As a member of the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, Simpson's 19 varsity teams compete for conference, regional and national championships each year. Simpson is committed to helping students become well-rounded athletes, and our student-athletes excel in the classroom and beyond.
