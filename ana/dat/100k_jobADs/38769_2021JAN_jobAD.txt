Well it all started when I could not get a job. I tried and tried and tried. Mostly it was the self-defeating thoughts I had. However that’s another story. Now one day while I was reading other websites about how to get rich online, I found this person talking about blogging. How many people try it and fail at it. Well since I was a failure anyways I thought to myself “why not give it a shot if I don’t succeed I won’t be surprised.” I had so many things I was passionate about. One being video games. As sad as it sounds it’s what I love. How childish right? This is what led me to start making videos of me playing other video games and reviewing them. I would go to the GameStop and rent a few games and play them through. Recoding every step of the way and making a complete walk through of the game. I would also write it down and take pictures. Giving my expert advice and all. After I did this I started uploading the videos to YouTube and spreading the word about the on every forum I could find. I was getting thousands of views a month. However when I noticed other people doing the same thing. They all had a website where they would recommend their fans come back to. As of this point I was just uploading my walkthroughs to forums. I was thinking about all the people I was losing to those sites. People who loved the same things as me. So I figured out how to make a website. It was not hard and I have little knowledge of making websites. I just bought a hosting service and installed WordPress on it. Then I started posting. People were coming in by the thousands from my YouTube videos and forum posts. This is when I realized something. These people really trust me and my content. Why not try to make money off them. So I started linking them to websites where they could buy stuff from companies. These companies then gave me a percentage of the sale. Now I make enough to live semi comfortably. I know this may sound farfetched but I really spent 2 years doing this before I made a dime. Anyways at the end of the day I guess it’s if you love something then try to make money off of it.-BrianIf you would like to set up your own blog to start making profit from, donations etc. Then you are in luck.
