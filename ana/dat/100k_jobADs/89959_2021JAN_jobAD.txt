These are the cars for the jobThinking of heading off on a staycation this summer? These are the cars for the jobThe staycation is a hot topic this summer. With the coronavirus pandemic causing people to consider holidays closer to home and within the UK, more people than ever will be turning to their cars as a way of escaping the norm.It means that you really do need a car which is up to the job. Here, we’ve picked out some of the best options for a variety of different requirements.The best for adventurers – Land Rover DefenderThe new Defender looks like it’s ready for an adventure. With chunky styling and plenty of off-road tech, it’s a car which will go here, there and everywhere. It’s also remarkably comfortable on the motorway, which will make longer sections of travel whisk away effortlessly.Available in both 90 and 110 layouts – or short- and long-wheelbase – the Defender is arguably one of the coolest ways to undertake a staycation.Take a look at Defender models hereThe best for practicality-lovers – Skoda Superb EstateWant plenty of space to pack the camping gear? You’ll want the Skoda Superb Estate then. As one of the most practical and capacious cars on sale today, it’s a great option for those who value space above all else. A great option for families, the Superb is packed with features designed to make it as versatile as possible.The Estate version features a frankly cavernous boot too, while you can fold down the rear seats to extend the load area even further.Take a look at Skoda Superb models hereThe best for staycationers on a budget – Dacia DusterAfter that go-anywhere charm but don’t want to break the bank in order to get it? The Dacia Duster could be the ideal car for you then. With prices starting from £11,245 – and even cheaper examples available on the used market – the Duster offers exceptional value for money.It’s comfortable and relatively refined, while despite its compact price tag incorporates a healthy level of standard equipment. It’s also solid in terms of reliability, so should prove to be a hassle-free staycation car for years to come.Take a look at Dacia Duster models hereThe best for sun lovers – Volkswagen T-Roc CabrioletIf you’re after the wind-in-your-hair feeling, then one of the most left-field choices in the convertible segment is the Volkswagen T-Roc Cabriolet. Essentially an SUV with the roof lopped off, the T-Roc Cab is quirky and easy to drive.It might not be the most practical, but the T-Roc’s alternative approach to convertible life is bound to find it in favour with many drivers.Take a look at Volkswagen T-Roc Cabriolet models hereThe best for speed hunters – Mercedes-AMG A45There might be those who want to inject a little bit of theatre into their staycation, and the Mercedes-AMG A45 is a great way of doing this. With a powerful 2.0-litre turbocharged engine it’s capable of out-pacing many high-end supercars.Yet despite this performance, the A45 is still practical. It has plenty of space in the cabin while the boot is a decent size, allowing you to take plenty of luggage along on your staycation.The best for EV lovers – Kia e-NiroMany people think that a staycation in an electric vehicle would be a rather short-run thing, and though many EVs do have a relatively limited range, the Kia e-Niro isn’t one of them. In fact, it’ll return well over 250 miles in between charges, allowing you to travel big distances with little fear of running out of charge.Since it’s based on the standard Niro, the e-Niro is also brilliantly practical with more than enough space for families.Take a look at Kia e-Niro models hereThe best for those who want to tow – Volvo XC40Volvo XC40 Recharge Plug-in HybridIf towing is your game, then one of the best – and most surprising – cars for the job is the Volvo XC40. Despite its relatively compact dimensions, it’s impressively capable when it comes to towing and is rated to tow up to 2,100kg of braked trailer.Add in the XC40’s refined looks, comfortable driving experience and excellent interior build quality, and you’ve got a really well-rounded tow car on your hands.Take a look at Volvo XC40 models hereCategories:DaciaKiaLand RoverMercedesSkodaVolkswagenVolvoNewsBy Jack EvansAfter completing his university studies in English and Creative Writing in Cardiff, Jack is now a full time motoring writer at Blackball Media.
