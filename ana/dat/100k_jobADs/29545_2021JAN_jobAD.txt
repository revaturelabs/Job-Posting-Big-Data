So while Fanimation is intensely focused on designing fans that leverage today’s trends and technologies, the company—thanks to Tom’s passion for antiques—is also devoted to preserving the history and evolution of fan design.In fact, one man was brought into Fanimation for that sole purpose.“This is a dream job to a fan geek,” says Kim Frank, Fanimation’s restoration guy.With an affinity for relics of all kinds, Kim has been involved in the restoration of antiques for nearly 50 years. He began as an apprentice at a furniture store, refinishing everything from cabinets and dining room sets, to barber chairs and other rare pieces. He has restored motorcycles over the years, too.“Woods and metals have always appealed to me,” he says. “And I felt like whatever I was working on, I could make it better—and make it look the way I wanted.”That passion eventually found its way to fans.Antiquing with his wife in a small Indiana town, Kim bought an old fan, restored it and found a new obsession. Before long, he was regularly buying fans, tinkering with them and reselling them online and at local shops and community events.In the early 2000s, at a local arts festival, a man walked up to his fan booth and began asking about his restoration experience.That man was Tom Frampton, owner of Fanimation.A couple years later, Kim saw a “Future Home of Fanimation” sign not far from his home. He reached out to Tom, reintroduced himself and saw some of Tom’s rare fans. Kim has been restoring fans for Fanimation ever since.Today, Kim, along with his son, Eddie, restores fans. They do everything from simple repairs, such as replacing cords or changing wicks, to completely rebuilding motors, fabricating parts and custom painting. All are restored to their original beauty—some look brand-new; others are made to look aged.Many of the fans they work on find their way into the Antique Fan Museum. Located at Fanimation’s headquarters, the museum displays fans on loan from members of the Antique Fan Collectors Association—including 56 from Kim’s personal collection and 1,500+ from Tom’s.A walk through the museum gives a peek into how the fans of yesteryear inspired more modern designs.The Savory Airator inspired one of Fanimation’s earlier fans called the Fargo.The 1920’s Victor Luminaire Parlor Fan was the design motivation for Fanimation’s Old Havana pedestal fan.Whatever time period they were developed in, Kim says they share the same quality.“For us, this is a form of art,” he says. “And we want to preserve it, learn from it and appreciate it.”Categories: Business, NewsCategoriesBusinessCompany UpdatesDealer SpotlightEnergy SavingsNewsProductTravelsArchivesArchives Select Month November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 June 2018 April 2018 February 2018 January 2018 November 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 May 2016 August 2015 June 2015 May 2015 February 2015 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 November 2011 October 2011 August 2011 June 2011 May 2011 May 2010Fanimation CatalogFanimation’s focus is producing creative and functional fans that provide ultimate personal comfort using the latest technology for energy efficiency and seamless control.DOWNLOADFanimation10983 Bennett ParkwayZionsville, IN 46077Phone: 888.567.2055Fax: 866.482.5215HomeBlogAntique Fan MuseumContactSanta Ana Voluntary RecallProductsProduct CatalogChoosing a FanSmart ControlsGear StoreProduct SupportProduct RegistrationFind an Authorized DealerSales Agent LocatorDealer PortalEnter your email address below to receive periodic communication from Fanimation.Subscribe© 2020 Fanimation.
