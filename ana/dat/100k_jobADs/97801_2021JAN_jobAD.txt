She worked there every summer for several years and really enjoyed it. She's such a people person and was nearly as good a sales associate as she was a teacher.The advantage to that job is they knew she was just there for the summer, so when she quit to start school, it was no big deal. She knew she could get on again when school was out. Seems like she even worked a couple of Christmas seasons on weekends for Christmas money.Post your commentsPlease enter the following code:Login:Forgot password?Register:ðŸ“¦Amazon Doesn't Want You to Know About This PluginLearn about a little known plugin that tells you if you're getting the best price on Amazon.LEARN MORE04Minutes00SecondsClear answers for common questionsFAQsAbout UsContact UsTestimonialsPrivacy PolicyTerms and ConditionsCopyright 2003 - 2021Conjecture CorporationFollow @wiseGEEKSubscribe to wiseGEEKLearn something new every day."
