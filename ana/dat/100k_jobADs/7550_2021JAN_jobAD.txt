And having said that, we have curated this list of 4 essential resume trends that would ensure that your resume does stand out.Compact resumeStop extending your resume for pages and pages when you can summarize it in a page or two max. Never extend your resume for over two pages. If you have way too much experience to contain in pages, screen the essential information, and let go of non-useful details. Remember, the details you put in must enable the reader to make detailed and informed choices. In short, don‚Äôt dump your resume with details that cannot help you get your next job.Keywords for ATS screeningRemember that time when people started giving themselves fancy titles.
