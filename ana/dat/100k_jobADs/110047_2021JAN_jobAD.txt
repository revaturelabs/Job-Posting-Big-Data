This is particularly true for the IT sector, where candidates need to keep up with a fast-paced industry that’s always changing.However, there are a number of things you can do to improve your chances and make the search a little easier. Here, we take a look at a few tips to improve your IT job search.Build a personal brandWhen searching for a new job, it’s absolutely vital that you begin to think about your own personal brand and how you’re selling yourself. This means creating or shaping a professional image and ensuring that nothing publicly contradicts the message you’re trying to get across.In the digital era, everything is public, instantly searchable and easy to find on the internet, so it won’t take employers long to dig up some information if you haven’t been careful. Make sure all your personal social network profiles are kept private and ensure you maintain a professional presence online at all times.Don’t rely on a single mediumAlthough it’s easy to resort to only searching for jobs online, there are also other ways to look for a new job. Diversify your search by looking in different places and via different mediums. Trade magazines and industry publications may provide a viable alternative should you feel that online searches are not delivering the desired results for example.Similarly, many companies no longer wait for employees to come to them and actively search them out on social media platforms such as LinkedIn. Consequently, it’s important to keep your LinkedIn profile up-to-date, interesting and attractive to potential employers.Exploit your existing professional networkNot all job searches need to be performed through traditional channels. Often, it’s better to take a more informal approach and use the professional and social networks you’ve built up while working. Try putting word out to old bosses, colleagues, managers and friends that you’re looking for a change and that you would appreciate them letting you know if anything’s available. Though there’s no guarantee they’ll be able to help, it may be the case that they can get word to you first if something does come up, giving you a head start on the rest of the competition.Use a specialist IT recruitment consultantIf you’re really struggling and feel like you need a little extra help finding a job, try using an IT recruitment consultancy. Consultants will normally have a great deal of industry expertise and be able to push you in the right direction, giving you advice about gaps in your IT skill set, interview technique or CV, and making you aware of new vacancies when they arise.Do your researchFinally, it’s important that you also do your research when it comes to finding a new job. There are numerous websites where you can find reviews of an employer by former staff, helping applicants to understand what it would be like to work for an organisation in the process.While all of these tips will help you refine and perfect your approach to searching for a job, you also need to ensure you remain positive and dedicated with your approach.Search our range of jobs availableShare this articleRecent CommentsI read some articles on this site and I think your blog is really interesting and has great information.
