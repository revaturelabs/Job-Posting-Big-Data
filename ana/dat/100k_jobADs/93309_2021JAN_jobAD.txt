The error message will be in the slurm output file. The slurmstepd error message may be preceeded with a message from srun that the job step was aborted.slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 3501970 ON nid00161 CANCELLED AT 2018-01-08T15:17:49 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***SolutionThere are two likely causes. Firstly, the job may have reached the maximum time it was allowed to run. Secondly, if you have a fixed allocation then your allocation may have been used up.SLURM allocates resources to a job for a fixed amount of time. This time limit is either specified in the job request, or if none is specified then it is the default limit. There are maximum limits on all SLURM partitions, so if you have not requested the maximum then try increasing the time limit in the request with the --time= flag to sbatch or salloc.#SBATCH --time=12:00:00To see the maximum and default time limits, use sinfo:> sinfo -o \"%.10P %.5a %.10l %.15L %.6D %.6t\" -p workq PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT     DEFAULTTIME  NODES  STATE    workq*    up 1-00:00:00         1:00:00      1  drain    workq*    up 1-00:00:00         1:00:00     20   resv    workq*    up 1-00:00:00         1:00:00     34    mix    workq*    up 1-00:00:00         1:00:00     25  allocUsually if your allocation is not sufficient to support a job running to completion, SLURM will not start the job. However, if multiple jobs start at the same time then each job may not hit the limit but collectively they might. When this happens they will all start, but get terminated when the allocation is used up. You can tell this is the case if the elapsed time does not match the job's timelimit.> sacct -j 2954681 -o jobid,elapsed,time       JobID    Elapsed  Timelimit------------ ---------- ----------2954681        05:54:30 1-00:00:002954681.bat+   05:54:312954681.ext+   05:54:312954681.0      05:54:30If this is the case, check whether your allocation is used up.
