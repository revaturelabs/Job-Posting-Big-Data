According to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, at least 250,000 direct, on-projects jobs, as well as hundreds of thousands of indirect jobs, were the result of 7,900 highway and transit projects that have broken ground across the country.“Since we first released our survey back in December 2009, states have identified 300 additional ‘ready-to-go’ projects that can be approved for funding within 120 days,’ said John Horsley, AASHTO executive director. “States continue to turn recovery dollars into real jobs and paychecks.”Since then, the House of Representatives has approved the Jobs for Main Street Act of 2010, which would provide $37 billion for transportation projects-$27.5 billion for highway infrastructure projects and $8.4 billion for public transportation. Based on the record demonstrated under the Recovery Act, such funding could potentially create or support 1.1 million jobs.“This survey illustrates the growing need for a significant investment in transportation infrastructure projects,” Horsley said. “The benefits are guaranteed and long lasting. Instead of the unemployment line, we’ll give hundreds of thousands of Americans the lifeline they need to stay in their homes, pay taxes, and rebuild our economy.”See the updated survey at: downloads.transportation.org/Ready-to-Go.pdf.More News:New study showing broad economic harm due to inadequate infrastructure investments coming Jan. 12Take IFAI’s survey: COVID-19’s Business Impact in 2020ASCE, MRCTI and U.S. Chamber of Commerce to host press teleconference on infrastructure resilience Dec. 16Civil engineers to grade Utah’s infrastructure through virtual news conference Dec. 16IECA Region One updates strategic planPreviousNextLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
