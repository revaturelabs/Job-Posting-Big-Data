Pfizer had already laid off around 30 sales staff in December following the expiry of the US patent.The company also operates manufacturing plants at Grange Castle in Dublin, Newbridge, Askeaton in Limerick, and at Loughbeg in Cork. It also has administrative operations at Citywest and Ringsend.Read: Pfizer sales staff face redundancy as patent expires on cholesterol drugMore: €19bn worth of Irish drug exports at risk as drug patents expireShort URLTweet thisShare on FacebookEmail this articleAbout the author:About the authorGavan Reilly@gavreillygavan@thejournal.ieSee more articles by Gavan ReillyContribute to this story:Leave a CommentSend a CorrectionRead next:Embed this postTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site600px wide<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/pfizer-confirms-loss-of-177-jobs-at-cork-manufacturing-sites-476062-Jun2012/?embedpost=476062&width=600&height=460\" ></iframe>400px wide<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/pfizer-confirms-loss-of-177-jobs-at-cork-manufacturing-sites-476062-Jun2012/?embedpost=476062&width=400&height=460\" ></iframe>300px wide<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/pfizer-confirms-loss-of-177-jobs-at-cork-manufacturing-sites-476062-Jun2012/?embedpost=476062&width=300&height=460\" ></iframe>Email “Pfizer confirms loss of 177 jobs at Cork manufacturing sites”.Your EmailRecipient's EmailSubmitFeedback on “Pfizer confirms loss of 177 jobs at Cork manufacturing sites”.Your FeedbackYour Email (optional)SubmitReport a CommentPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.
