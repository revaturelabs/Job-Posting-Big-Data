In fact, more than half of the UK population will look for a new job in 2018. It can be tempting to focus solely on the offered salary. However, a wider perspective which takes into account the entire package being offered is advisable. Other factors to be considered include:Pension ContributionsIt can be important to consider whether your employer is using a defined contribution (DC) pension or a defined benefit (DB) pension scheme. The average employer for a DC scheme puts in 3.2% of salary, but this number can range from the minimum 1% to 10%. The average employer for a DB scheme, conversely, puts on 16.9%. If you seek a greater reward for your work, rather than additional cash, this can be a way of getting more money from your employer by diverting a greater amount of your salary into your pension.Life CoverAlmost all employers offer a payment of several times your salary if you die while performing contractual duties. The majority will also pay for income protection; this will provide you with a regular income if you are unable to work for a while.Medical InsuranceOne-fifth of employees have private medical insurance. To replace this benefit, it would cost an average of just under £1,500. The benefits outweigh the payment of tax on their cover.Save as You Earn SchemesAfter paying a monthly sum into such schemes for a period of three to five years, you will be given a bonus. You can then buy shares in your employer at a fixed price. If the share price has increased during the period you can buy the shares at a large discount. If share price has fallen, you simply get your savings back with the addition of the bonus.If you are currently involved in such schemes and decide to move employers, you will only get your savings back and no longer have the option to buy shares. Occasionally a new employer will compensate you for the forgone share options.Other Benefits on OfferThese include:Tax-free childcare vouchers;Tax-efficient computer or bike schemes;Season ticket loans;Cheaper insurance cover;Discounted shopping vouchers;Free parking.In conclusion, it is important to compare ALL the benefits offered by an existing and potential employer before deciding to accept a new job. There may be the possibility to negotiate with your current employer over the benefits offered.Share this page:Tags: employees, employers, employment, job, Job Market, labour, pay, pension, Recruitment Connection Ltd, salaries, salary, Simon Bean, survey, wagesPost navigationThe Rise of the Gig EconomyRecruitment news Jan 2018 – Permanent recruitment continues to rise at an increasing paceRecently Added AssignmentsAdministration ManagerN/A, Epsom, United KingdomIFA AdministratorN/A, Horsham, United KingdomRegional ManagerN/A, Horsham, United KingdomParaplanner - Southern France.
