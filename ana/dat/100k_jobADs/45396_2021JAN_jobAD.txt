Salary: £25-35k + flexible working hours + pension + private health + personal training budget + 25 days holiday + additional time off for community projects! Web Developer with demonstrable experience of building high quality websites using PHP, HTML, CSS & JavaScript (including JQuery), preferably coupled with knowledge of Drupal/content management systems, required by leading digital marketing agency in central Birmingham, to further strengthen their sociable & talented team as a result of an internal promotion. Applicants would be considered from graduates with relevant commercial experience gained from a sandwich placement year or since completing their studies. A degree itself is not a pre-requisite for this role though. Importantly, the successful candidate will be competent enough to hit the ground running on a web project with the capability to take on a storyboard from a designer & realise this without the need for too much support (albeit with open access to a Team Leader, your fellow developers & a personal training budget). In addition to demonstrable experience with PHP, HTML/CSS/JavaScript (including JQuery) & Bootstrap, any further knowledge of Drupal (v7/8), MVC frameworks (particularly Laravel, Symfony & Zend), Mobile development & AngularJS would add genuine value to your application but is by no means essential. Of key importance is a fantastic attitude, a passion for producing high quality websites & a team-oriented approach. In return for your commitment, you can look forward to joining a uniquely employee focused organisation that not only offers access to an impressive portfolio of clients but also a fantastic studio work environment, first class opportunities for training (with a budget in place for each individual) & career development (into team lead roles), 25 days holiday (as well as additional paid time off for community projects), private healthcare, a contributory pension scheme & some very adventurous team away days! Perhaps of key importance to creative individuals is the way in which innovation & out-of-the-box thinking is actively encouraged.
