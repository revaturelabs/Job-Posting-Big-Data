We emphasize inter-disciplinary learning, collaboration, and care for communities, while maintaining a focus on better understanding all the social determinants of health. Our faculty pursue a range of scholarly research that incorporates systems- and design-thinking which translates into sustainable, scalable solutions to advance knowledge and improve health and the delivery of care.Parkinson is the academic home for Loyola’s participation in the Institute for Translational Medicine (ITM). The ITM is a Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) partnership between the University of Chicago and Rush in collaboration with Advocate Health Care, the Illinois Institute of Technology, Loyola University Chicago, and NorthShore University Health System that is fueled by almost $35 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). The ITM is part of the national network of more than 60 NIH-supported CTSA sites working on clinical informatics innovation and accelerating the time it takes to develop and implement new treatments and health innovation into practice.Parkinson faculty collaborate in health informatics and data science research with the: Loyola University Health System (a member of Trinity Health, a not-for-profit Catholic health system operating 93 hospitals in 22 states); Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN) and PCORNet; Veterans Health Administration, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital; U.S. Food and Drug Administration; and various health foundations.There has never been a more important time to build a new inter-disciplinary health sciences and public health school.
