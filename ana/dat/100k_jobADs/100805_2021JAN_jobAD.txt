(Question From A Man) Is A Man That Doesn’t Have A Job A LoserFebruary 13, 2020 by Alannah	Answering a question or a rather long email that I got from a man saying that he doesn’t have a job and telling me I was a judgmental Christian for talking saying that a man does not work does not eat. As he saw both my video and my read my blog on if a man does not work which came from the following Bible verse (2 Thessalonians 3:10). Saying that he does not work and if that made him a loser.And of course, in true Sophia form I cannot tell a lie, yes I may be a little direct call it the ENTJ/INTJ in me for all my psychology people out there. But just know I really do mean well.Go here to join my Patron to learn how to glow up and level up:Get The 100% free ebook, the Modern Christian Women’s Year-Round Capsule Wardrobe Plan.Link to all my products: (including my book for single women)Tutorial on how I did my hair:Related Blogs:If A Man Does Not Work Then He’s Not Worth Your TimeVideo about the traits of a good man and how a man does not work he does not eat:Song in intro (Single Mom Anthem):Connect with me BlogFollow me on Instagram: IG sophie_sticatedmomBlog:YouTube:Faceboook www.facebook.com/SophiaReedmftTwitter @SophiaReedmftEmail: sophiareed@sophie-sticatedmom.comIf you want to donate to my channel to help me create more amazing content: paypal.me/sophiesticatedmomBeauty Tips For Men February 13, 2020 by Alannah	Releated PostBeauty Tips for Men in Tamil – Grow Thick Beard & Mustache in Tamil – மீசை தாடி அடர்த்தியாக வளரEasiest Guide To Men's Korean Skincare Routine | What's TrendingGrooming Tips for Men: How to Shape Your Eyebrows Like a Pro!✅ Cure for Mens Bushy Eyebrows – Men’s Grooming Tips4 Hot Korean Men Try Weird Korean Beauty Products | 4 ReviewersSkin Whitening And Lightening Tips In Urdu Hindi || Beauty Tips For Men & WomenSearch for:Latest Female StoriesView AllLatest Female StoriesMum’s game changing passionfruit vodka recipeJanuary 22, 2021Latest Female StoriesMagic Mike star reveals the daily diet that keeps him fit for the stage showJanuary 22, 2021Latest Female StoriesSydney restaurant Sup Boss launches epic Lotus Biscoff roti dessertJanuary 22, 2021Make Up TipsView AllMakeup Tips For BeginnersWHY I ALMOST QUIT YOUTUBE | 100K SUBSCRIBERS | Nikol JohnsonMarch 5, 2020Makeup Tips For Older Women26 BRILLIANT HACKS EVERY GIRL SHOULD KNOWMarch 5, 2020Makeup Tips And TricksMature Skin Makeup Tutorial | LOOK YOUNGERMarch 4, 2020Fashion TipsView AllFashion Tips Short GirlsStylish Daily Wear Kurti Designs| Casual Kurti For Daily WearMarch 5, 2020Fashion Tips Plus GirlsStylish new plus size fashion week – Plus Size Clothing designer tipsMarch 5, 2020Fashion Tips For WomenModern Fashion and Style Tips for Professionals (Men and Women)March 4, 2020Hair Care Tips For Wavy HairView AllHair Care Tips For Wavy HairULTIMATE WINTER PAMPER ROUTINE!
