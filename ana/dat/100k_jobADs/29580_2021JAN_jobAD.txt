Networking works much like six degrees of separation. Anything is possible, and you never know just who you or who a friend is connected with until you put in the effort.As a general rule, there are never more than six people between you and the person you wish to meet. Networking is the best way to access otherwise inaccessible people, as employers of prominent companies.Having contacts within certain organizations can help to learn about the company you are submitting your application in hope to receive a job interview.Reliable contacts can give you the scoop about the employer, the co-workers, the work environment, or any other helpful information.

Being visible and available to your connections will build your status.Enhance your professional reputation by being supportive and knowledgeable while you are exchanging information.Networking will play a critical role if you want to make a career change from one industry to another. Or, a career transition from one position to entirely new one. Research and learn as much as possible about the industry sector or the available position you wish to secure. Researching will be incredibly helpful with each step of your job search.Networking Is a Two-Way StreetAnother significant advantage of networks is that it is a two-way street. It’s a circle of friends or acquaintances who help each other to improve their careers. When you assist your connections, others will more than likely assist you.Everyone likes people who are helpful—fabulous opportunities will likely come to you if you are accommodating to others. In every networking situation, don’t leave without letting those in attendance know who you are, what you do, and how to contact you. A business card is a must.Lastly, remember that in every social gathering you are involved in, make sure that people leave knowing how to get a hold of you. Opportunities come from unexpected places and when you least expect them. You never know who you may talk to that could need your skills.Career leads and job opportunities come from unexpected places and when you least expect them.
