I think that it may well disrupt the market for the simple reason that it’s built on Office 365 and uses the same content delivery and collaboration tools that students will use after graduation. Perhaps, for the first time in this market, there is a set of tools that teachers are already using in their day-to-day work, that can be used to develop courses and activities that provide an authentic and transferable experience to students.Office 365 for Education is free for all institutions from K-12 through Higher Ed so this is a very smart move!I intend to introduce students on EG-252 to Teams and Planner (already available at my University) but if the Teams for Classroom features are activated in time, I may well use it for my modules EGLM03 and EG-247 next year.Author cpjoblingPosted on September 13, 2017 Categories #susalt17, Blog, reflectionTags office 365, onenote class notebook, planner, teamsLeave a comment on OneNote Class Notebook and Classroom Teams	OneNote Class Notebook and Classroom TeamsAt Wednesday’s SALT Conference, I presented a demonstration of OneNote Class Notebook to my colleagues.
