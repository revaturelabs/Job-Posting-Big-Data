But what was the medieval knight truly like?In this fascinating title, former Senior Curator at the Royal Armouries Christopher Gravett describes how knights evolved over three centuries of English and European history, the wars they fought, their lives both in peacetime and on campaign, the weapons they fought with, the armour and clothing they wore and their fascinating code and mythology of chivalry. The text is richly illustrated with images ranging from manuscript illustrations to modern artwork reconstructions and many photographs of historic artefacts and sites.https://userupload.net/aq7gnz1yvikfShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...Categories History & War Post navigationScoff: A History of Food and Class in Britain by Pen VoglerAll Together Now by Alan DoyleLeave a Comment Cancel replyCommentName Email WebsiteSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.GroupsNewest | Active | Popular | AlphabeticalBook Request ZoneActive 10 hours, 43 minutes ago	FAQHow to Download eBooks?Username PasswordRemember MeArchivesArchives Select Month January 2021 (403) December 2020 (685) November 2020 (595) October 2020 (693) September 2020 (808) August 2020 (1318) July 2020 (1634) June 2020 (1106) May 2020 (904) April 2020 (952) March 2020 (1056) February 2020 (813) January 2020 (713) December 2019 (669) November 2019 (503) October 2019 (544) September 2019 (731) August 2019 (640) July 2019 (597) June 2019 (776) May 2019 (1112) April 2019 (693) March 2019 (3)CalendarJanuary 2021MTWTFSS1 2 34 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15 16 1718 19 20 21 22 23 2425 26 27 28 29 30 31« DecRecent CommentsIce426 on Murder on the Menu by Fiona LeitchAnthony p Lewsley on Queen of Storms by Raymond E.
