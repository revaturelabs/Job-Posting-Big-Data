Indeed, for the most part the iOS keyboard has remained unchanged throughout the years, sans a few improvements here and there.That will change when iOS 7 comes this Fall as it makes the iOS keyboard smarter by introducing black and white theme, enhanced auto-correct that can fix misspellings in a combination of words and a few other small tweaks. While there are no signs of Apple opening up the iOS keyboard to third-party developers anytime soon, new job ads indicate the company is working on adding support for additional languages and writing systems…The job listing spotted by Jordan Kahn of 9to5Mac reveals that Apple is actively looking to add engineers to “work closely with international teams and native speakers to accommodate all the world’s script systems.”The job description mentions (emphasis mine):The iPhone and iPad keyboards revolutionized the way that people use their mobile devices to communicate, and we’re only getting started!“The keyboard architecture is constantly evolving as we continue to innovate and introduce breakthrough text input mechanisms for millions of users worldwide,” teases an ad for an engineer on Apple’s keyboard and text team.For what it’s worth, Apple previously said iOS 7 will bring “a Chinese-English bilingual dictionary, and improved Chinese input including handwriting recognition for multiple Chinese characters”.iOS currently supports more than fifty languages and input methods, but there are still parts of the world where a localized keyboard with spell checker remains absent so Apple is probably looking to fill those holes going forward.While Siri partner Nuance hinted at iOS keyboard discussions with Apple, there are no immediate indications of Apple’s willingness to adopt the popular Nuance-made Swype for Android keyboard in iOS 7.At the same time, Android’s SwiftKey maker TouchType opined in an interview with AllThingsD that Apple will have to open up keyboard access in iOS sooner than later.“The most obvious API for them to open is the keyboard, because it is the greatest weakness,” TouchType’s marketing boss Joe Braidwood said.And should Apple decide to open up the iOS keyboard, his company would port SwiftKey for Android over to iOS in “a matter of a few months,” he said.Which brings me to my question of the day: are you satisfied with the stock iOS keyboard experience relative to Android? And if not, how would you improve the experience if you were Apple?Tagged:AppleiOSiOS 7JobsKeyboardMORE FROM iDBApple posts iOS 7.1.1 with additional Touch ID fixesiOS 7 Safari supports new shortcuts with external keyboardsA closer look at smarter keyboard in iOS 7NewsletterGet updates directly into your inbox.SubscribeFeaturedLatestLuca Todesco teases pongoOS running on an M1-equipped MacChimera jailbreak updated to version 1.6.1 with Userspace reboot improvementsCan Samsung sway you away from the iPhone?PriceBot, TV Remote, Onrise, and other apps to check out this weekendApple is reportedly testing in-screen Touch ID for 2021 iPhone, developing foldable iPhone prototypes, and AirTags may launch this yearLuca Todesco teases pongoOS running on an M1-equipped MacChimera jailbreak updated to version 1.6.1 with Userspace reboot improvementsSubstitute receives another update, this time to version 2.0.6Can Samsung sway you away from the iPhone?PriceBot, TV Remote, Onrise, and other apps to check out this weekendJailbreak NewsLuca Todesco teases pongoOS running on an M1-equipped MacChimera jailbreak updated to version 1.6.1 with Userspace reboot improvementsSubstitute receives another update, this time to version 2.0.6Does the Chimera jailbreak work on the newly released iOS 12.5.1?SmartVolumeMixer2 offers seamless control over all your iPhone’s different volume levelsAppsPriceBot, TV Remote, Onrise, and other apps to check out this weekendApple is now blocking M1 Mac users from sideloading iPhone and iPad appsHow to view apps using your Apple ID for “Sign in with Apple”Jailbreakers can customize their Home Screen’s app icon labels with Labels+The best apps for car shopping on iPhone and iPadAccessoriesThe best wallet cases for iPhone 12 (all models)This popular wireless charging pad is down to $9Belkin recalls the Portable Wireless Charger and Stand over fire hazardThe best eco-friendly cases for the iPhone 12 lineupReview: The Logitech Circle View Doorbell features great hardware only limited by HomeKitPodcastLet’s Talk iOS 378: Alive and wellChanges are coming to the Let’s Talk iOS podcast and we want to hear from youTwitter snaps up Breaker, a podcast app focused on social interactionLet’s Talk iOS 377: A solution in search of a problemAmazon has acquired podcasting company WonderyDealsApple iPhone 7 Unlocked 128GB Jet Black (Grade B) for $549 Verv Premium Home Workout Planner: Lifetime Subscription for $39 The Complete 2021 QuickBooks Bootcamp Bundle for $29Download the iDB appAbout | Contact | Disclosure | Privacy | Unsubscribe2021 © iDownloadBlog.com - This website is not affiliated with Apple.HomeAppsTutorialsJailbreak NewsJailbreak TweaksDownloadsWallpapersAccessoriesDealsPodcastsWrite for iDBContact Us"
