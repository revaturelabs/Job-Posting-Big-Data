This division specialises in the placement of temporary and permanent staff into jobs in the industrial, Engineering and Driving Sectors in East Dorset and the New ForestHi,I will not require any of your staff for next week (currently). I will be talking to them all before tea break to explain. I need to forecast dispatches to NZ and OZ over the weekend and I will only incorporate our full time staff’s productivity. There is a strong chance that NZ and OZ will reject my forecast and demand more. If this is the case then I will let you know and hopefully the guys I have now will still be available????I want to thank you for finding the staff I have now. They meet the criteria perfectly and get along with everyone at our company.Please find attached the time sheet for this week (fax to follow).RegardsProduction ManagerRemovals CompanyTestimonial for City Centre Recruitment of Yeovil, Weymouth, Bournemouth, Taunton, Charminster and Southampton.

The team have been very attentive to the personnel needs of our section which currently amounts to over £200,000 per annum. On one occasion they astounded me by reacting to my urgent 'out of the blue' request at approximately 6pm one evening for a competent admin person, totally different to my usual requirements to start the following morning.
