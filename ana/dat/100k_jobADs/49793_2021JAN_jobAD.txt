Finally a new Fire Emblem game on the 3DS.Here is the first review I have seen. Gametrailers link. If you just can't wait to know; they loved it. It looks to be a great game in the franchise.Whatever we may think about this moment, our practice is just to return to it.

I am flummoxed.Edit: Christ, finally got it. Probably my tenth try. I lost all but three units, and won on a counter-attack with a 48% chance to hit with 4 HP left. This might've been easier if I took a more traditional approach, but I went with what felt right.If you're playing on hard, there is no such thing as too much grinding.If anyone's wondering, my in-game clock reads 41:05. The system-level activity log reads 63:51.My quick impressions, as it's been a long day/night - amazing game, one of my two favorite 3DS games. Definitely the best Fire Emblem, and I will brook no argument otherwise.IUH4LNintendo 3DS FC: 4553-9959-1561Nintendo Network ID: Blind_EvilimbiginjapanPosted: February 25, 2013 1:57 PMPermalinkvs. MechaimbiginjapanNear Providence, RIAny news on the retail situation for this game?

Unless I can find no other means of purchase I tend to avoid downloading titles as the system is more likely to travel with me, and thus more likely to be lost, stolen or damaged. For that reason I prefer to have hard copies of games for portables.It should be noted I bit on it even though I don't even have a 3DS yet. :pSteam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/biginja... | XBOX/PSN: BigInJapanGWJ\"DO NOT HUMILATE IN FRONT of FIFA 14 Coins and OWN PEERS!!!\" - Spambot wisdom.DSGamerPosted: February 28, 2013 7:08 AMPermalinkThumbs Up ... ishAmericaJust finished this. I'm tempted to go back through on Hard/Classic or even a level above that. The game got really easy at a certain point due to all the random encounters and the money / XP I had. It would be nice to play it more resource constrained.It only took me 30 hours, so that diverges wildly from most of the numbers I've seen, making me think that Normal/Classic is a \"baby game\" for veteran Fire Emblem players. I got to a point where it was so easy that I let the computer pick equipment and fight the random battles using Auto Turn. There just wasn't much challenge after Chapter 12.Switch - SW-4008-5437-6025DSGamerPosted: February 28, 2013 7:22 AMPermalinkThumbs Up ... ishAmericaAlso, regarding the ending...Spoiler:Can you save your created character?EDIT: Never mind. I went back, reloaded the save and chose the ending where my character sacrifices herself. I get it now. I was hoping there was more too it than that. Or maybe there is and I fulfilled the requirements. I'd like to play a version now where I do better with relationships and open up all of the paralogues. And where I can truly min/max, something I didn't need to do I'm this game after a certain point.Switch - SW-4008-5437-6025FerretPosted: February 28, 2013 8:36 AMPermalinkNo longer illegal in most statesUnder a couch in Austin, TXDSGamer wrote:Just finished this.

Grind minimally on Hard/Classic? How much grinding is too much? I tend to agree. I really like the game in terms of fit and finish, but mechanically it's the weakest of the 4 American portable Fire Emblem games because the grinding and DLC maps allow you to become god-like very quickly and with multiple characters.Switch - SW-4008-5437-6025DSGamerPosted: February 28, 2013 11:55 AMPermalinkThumbs Up ... ishAmericaSome perspective. With Gale Force on multiple Pegasus class characters I was able to finish the last level in 3 turns. Seriously. There's a brutal combination where you pair two upclassed Pegasus characters that have Gale Force. They can attack 3 times per turn (attack, Gale Force, switch to the other one, attack, Gale Force, attack) and they're basically unstoppable.I want to play again and get a more classic FE experience. Just not sure how to do that currently. Kids + Spotpass, random and DLC maps broke the game for me.Switch - SW-4008-5437-6025Blind_EvilPosted: February 28, 2013 12:18 PMPermalinkVenetian TerrorSouthern New HampshireDSGamer wrote:I want to play again and get a more classic FE experience.

Not sure how much grinding it \"assumes\" you'll do, but H/C with minimal grinding might hold up fairly decently.DSGamerPosted: February 28, 2013 3:54 PMPermalinkThumbs Up ... ishAmericaBNice wrote:DSGamer wrote:Some perspective.

I'll take the props for that. I think you need to reclass as the Dark Pegasus or whatever it's called to learn that skill, but it doesn't take long. You get multiple Pegasus Knights and you can reclass someone like your Avatar as well.To me that is Fire Emblem. Find those fun characters to min/max and exploit them. I just think the exploits available in this game are much much bigger.I started another game on Hard and it's much harder in the early going. Especially if I want to keep people alive. I'll run with this for now. Part of the problem last time was that by the time it got too easy I didn't want to restart the game. Now I've completed it so I won't mind getting stalled for a while at certain spots.Switch - SW-4008-5437-6025DSGamerPosted: March 2, 2013 2:08 AMPermalinkThumbs Up ... ishAmericaOkay, so hard is much harder.

NOOOOOO!Actually the guy with the ax at the first. Whom I never used anyway. I played that level 3 or 4 times before I finally just caved and realized that not only did Hard mean relearning techniques that drifted away while I was trouncing through Normal, but it also meant being okay with an actual permadeath here or there. I'm sure he's not the last. I don't even use Stahl. Right now he's just bait for a later day.Switch - SW-4008-5437-6025DSGamerPosted: March 4, 2013 5:59 AMPermalinkThumbs Up ... ishAmericaFerret wrote:DSGamer wrote:Just finished this.

Hard 5 in Shadow Dragon was *amazing*, and I'm more than a little disappointed Awakening fell flat on replicating that experience.Well, this has proven true for me as well. Hard/Classic was really hard in the early going. Too hard for me. Eventually between pairing and random encounters my team got leveled up to the point where they're unstoppable again. According to the DS clock I've put 70 hours into this game. Time to take a break back to the Vita or Advance Wars. Unless we get a version of Fire Emblem closer to FE7 it's always going to be like this. Large difficulty curve followed by the need to build up characters followed by domination. I like building a dominating team, but it was much more rewarding in games like Tactics Ogre or FFTA.Switch - SW-4008-5437-6025imbiginjapanPosted: March 4, 2013 1:41 PMPermalinkvs. MechaimbiginjapanNear Providence, RIDSGamer, it sounds like you had some issues with both Normal and Hard but that aside what level did you ultimately prefer?On hard did you find yourself often turning on the system for a session with the sole intent of leveling up? I am all for a strong challenge and am usually really good at turn based tactics games but am not exactly enamored with the \"old school\" JRPG habit of making a player spend hours doing nothing but leveling up in order to trivialize a primary encounter.Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/biginja... | XBOX/PSN: BigInJapanGWJ\"DO NOT HUMILATE IN FRONT of FIFA 14 Coins and OWN PEERS!!!\" - Spambot wisdom.DSGamerPosted: March 4, 2013 3:41 PMPermalinkThumbs Up ... ishAmericaimbiginjapan wrote:DSGamer, it sounds like you had some issues with both Normal and Hard but that aside what level did you ultimately prefer?On hard did you find yourself often turning on the system for a session with the sole intent of leveling up? I am all for a strong challenge and am usually really good at turn based tactics games but am not exactly enamored with the \"old school\" JRPG habit of making a player spend hours doing nothing but leveling up in order to trivialize a primary encounter.Well, that's the trick. I became god-like quicker in Normal. But I got there either way. I'm half way through Hard and I'm pretty sure I'm not going to finish the game because it would just be marching my party members across the battlefield and avoiding doing something really really stupid. Otherwise the game is all but over.As to any kind of advice, that's tricky. I wish there was a level between Normal and Hard. I feel like Hard starts off difficult enough to force you to grind a little. Whereas on Normal I didn't try to grind. I was just having fun playing the game like I would any other Fire Emblem game and stumbled into becoming unstoppable sooner than I thought I would. If I had it to do over again or if I played it again in the future I'd probably personally play it on Normal/Classic and then never do a random encounter or optional battle. I'd only take the XP, loot and money given to me by the regular levels. I think that feels like the \"optimal\" way to play it and not grind. Maybe let guys die if they die and don't reset the game and replay the level.Either that or I'd play it on Hard, but turn off permadeath. That way it would behave like most other SRPGs. You could sacrifice people on the way towards finishing a level, but you'd most likely never be forced to grind. It would be a bit less like Fire Emblem at that point and a bit more like Advance Wars, but that might be what's required to get that balance.Switch - SW-4008-5437-6025imbiginjapanPosted: March 4, 2013 3:44 PMPermalinkvs. MechaimbiginjapanNear Providence, RIDSGamer wrote:If I had it to do over again or if I played it again in the future I'd probably personally play it on Normal/Classic and then never do a random encounter or optional battle.
