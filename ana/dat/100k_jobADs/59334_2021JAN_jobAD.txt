With unemployment figures at the highest they have been in years, the number of people not believing they can strive for success is scary. However, there are many ways in which anybody can obtain a great role, whether you have 500 GCSE’s or haven’t been educated in years. With the right attitude, anybody can chase a great job, be it via a recruitment agency or relentlessly chasing down many interviews and there are a lot of job portals available as well to get you the job according to your needs. Here we take a look at a few ways in which anybody at all can increase their chances of getting a great job.Think Who You Would HireThe best thing to start off with is to put yourself in the shoes of the employer. If you carefully think about who you would hire, you can pinpoint all the factors that would or wouldn’t make a good employee. Remember, the person that is perfect for the job may be the polar opposite of what you’d expect. Yes, the experience is important, but there are many other elements involved in being a reliable employee. If someone has a humble attitude and is ready to work hard, that is more than likely a preferable trait over someone who has a degree. People hire people, not paper, so a few grades on a CV doesn’t tell the whole story. When the employer is seeking a new employee, they will ask themselves two questions. Will they do the job right? Do I see myself working well with this person? The right attitude will always beat a proven track record.READ Going Remote?
