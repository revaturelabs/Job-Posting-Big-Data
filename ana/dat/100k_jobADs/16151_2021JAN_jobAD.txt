The “star”-tling story.by Jeff Cormier — in Apple65sharesSome things you can’t make up, some things you can, and others you simply report on what may or may not have been made up by others.According to a story on Bloomberg.com, by way of SPA! magazine, Apple CEO, and apparently closet Ninja, Steve Jobs, will not be a visitor in the land of the rising sun anytime soon after he was barred from “taking Ninja throwing stars aboard his private plane.”Yes, you read that correctly, Ninja throwing stars.The incident evidently arose in July at Kansai International Airport, near Osaka, where a security scan revealed his novice Ninja skills, by detecting Ninja throwing stars inside his carry-on luggage.Jobs was reportedly returning to the U.S. from Kyoto, where he and his family were vacationing, the Japanese magazine reported, citing (the always reliable) “unidentified officials at the airport and the transportation ministry.”This is where the Apple CEO’s story gets juicy (yes, I went there). Upon being stopped, “Jobs said it wouldn’t make sense for a person to try to hijack his own plane, according to the report. He then told officials he would never visit Japan again, the magazine reported. Apple declined to comment.”While a spokesman confirmed an unidentified passenger was stopped in July for “carrying shuriken, the Japanese word for Ninja throwing stars,” which were then apparently thrown away.What could Jobs have been planning to do with the Ninja throwing stars? First thought is, don’t attend the next Keynote and keep your laptop up, or ask an even remotely argumentative question, or you’ll be seeing stars, flying at you that is (I went there too).As my mind races with all of the other possibilities, I’d love to hear those you have. In fact, they’re more than likely better than mine.Read next: Foursquare eyes app store promos as Nokia reveals official appAppleSteve JobsShare on Facebook (10)Share on Twitter (55)Most popular1Engineers have built machines to scrub CO2 from the air – and it could halt climate change	The Conversation2SpaceX breaks India's record by launching 143 satellites on a single rocket	Ivan Mehta3Maker of Sophia the robot plans to sell droids to people seeking company during COVID	Thomas Macaulay4Here are 15 of the most asked Node.js interview questions	Live Code Stream5Night at the Museum brought to life by new mixed reality tech	The ConversationNever miss outStay tuned with our weekly recap of what’s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.Thank you!Do itJoin over 260,000 subscribers!Latest1Uber expands its low-emission ride options to 1,400 more North American cities	Cities Today23 reasons why almost every VC investor passed on Zoom	Philip Levinson3It’s happening!
