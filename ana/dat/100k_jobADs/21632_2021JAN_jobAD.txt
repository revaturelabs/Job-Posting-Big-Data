But we studied outside Kerala for our nursing diploma courses. A few nurses from other Indian states are also facing the same issue,” said one of the affected nurses.“Many of us have already lost our jobs and now we are unable to continue our studies and apply for another job, leaving us in a ‘do or die’ situation,” said another.The nurses said they would approach India’s Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan, who is scheduled to visit the UAE this week, seeking his urgent intervention to solve the issue.CLICK TO FOLLOW UKMALAYALEE.COMCategoriesHealthSportsCinemaMalayalam NewsFoodRecent StoriesThiruvananthapuram native dies of Covid in Hayes in LondonOctober 17, 2019UK university scientists finalise nasal spray that blocks out COVID-19: ReportOctober 17, 2019New strain of virus found in UK is more transmissible and more deadly: Boris JohnsonOctober 17, 2019BBC apologises for airing \"Inaccurate\" map of IndiaOctober 17, 2019UK extends Coronavirus vaccination campaign to people over the age of 70October 17, 2019UK invites Prime Minister Modi to attend G7 summit in Cornwall region in June 2021October 17, 2019Trending TopicsWorld knew about Jallianwala Bagh massacre ..Priya Prakash Varrier signs Rs 1-crore deal ..Liverpool Malayalee Association to celebrate ..Nivin Pauly’s family entertraner ..Latest NewsBan Campus politics in Kerala: Justice Kamal ..Liverpool Malayalee Association to celebrate ..Nivin Pauly’s family entertainer ..The advantages of having NRO and NRE accountsWhat should British Indian OCI card holders ..NRIs must register for Goods and Services ..NewsKerala NewsUK NewsAssociation NewsReligious NewsImmigration NewsIndiaWorld NewsRecent StoriesThiruvananthapuram native dies of Covid in Hayes in LondonUK university scientists finalise nasal spray that blocks out COVID-19: ReportNew strain of virus found in UK is more transmissible and more deadly: Boris JohnsonTagsHealth SportsFollow usHomeASSOCIATIONNRIIMMIGRATIONUKKERALAWORLDMOVIESPORTSCLASSIFIEDS© 2020 Uk Malayalee ® All Right Reserved	www.ukmalayalee.com relies on cookies to collect and process data.
