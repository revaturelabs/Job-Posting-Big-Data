Bed\"We've all seen it. Nearly every issue of high fashion womens magazines feature poolside photo layouts. Now it's Tanner's turn! And he's in his element. Even when not in the water, Tanner enjoys lounging by the pool just like a beach property owner loves the view.© Carrie BoykoPoolside Garden AppreciationBetter From a P.L.A.Y. Bed!© Carrie BoykoGreat Hip SupportToday Tanner is showing off his new bed from Eco-friendly dog bed maker Pet Lifestyle and You, or P.L.A.Y. It's oh so much better than the couch or his skimpy bed that appear in yesterday's post that begged the question, \"Do Dogs Need Beds?\" Their motivation was a pint-sized pug named Momo. Momo won their heart and inspired this sustainable line of beds that have some very unique features.© Carrie BoykoHot, But ComfyDuvets allow us to change our quilt's look with a quick new cover. The folks at P.L.A.Y. believe that pet owners should be able to have that same perk. While they readily admit that most pups are just as happy to sack out on our dirty Tshirts that carry our scent, a comfortable, supportive, and fashionable bed is all the more pleasurable for both you and Fido. Duvets are available to purchase separately so that you can now change up your home's look, as well as Fido's, with a quick switch of the slipcover. What an inspired idea!© courtesy PetPlay.comWhat do we like best about Tanner's new P.L.A.Y. bed? Besides the fact that it is made of denim--my fave decorating fabric--the filling is also an exciting element. Sounds geekie, I know, but I get excited about recycled products. The inside of this bed is made of recycled bottles, a whopping 92 of them to be exact. That's a lot of trash that did not end up in the landfill and I'm feeling pretty okay about that!© Carrie BoykoSunset ApproachesTime for a Bedtime SnackNeedless to say, Tanner is greatly enjoying his new bed no matter where we place it. For now we'll call it a day and get ready for bedtime. It will be dark soon, so that means a bedtime snack, courtesy of Dog Skout Cookies. Am I crazy? Maybe, but then how many of us actually do poolside photo shoots with dog models? If the dog bed fits, sleep in it!Want to see more? The designs are fun and fashionable, just like your home. You can also learn more about this cool company at their Facebook page and their blog.

Dog Bed for my 19 year old pug Mugsy. He currently has no dog bed and lays on a stack of blankets that do not support him enough. He is currently has many medical problems and has a severe back problem called: Intervertebral Disk Syndrome. His back looks like a dinoasaur's back. Link to why Mugsy deserves this bed: http://www.gopetsamerica.com/dog-health/intervertebral-disk-disease.aspx . We are currently struggling financially and just managed to raise enough money to cover his vet exams, x-rays, blood work, radiologist tests and diagnostic testing. Link to Mugsy's Get Well Wishes Page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Get-Well-Wishes-Mugsy-Fan-Page/151161164964765?ref=ts . We have a chip in page for Mugsy to help us cover his medical treatments. You are more than welcome to contact our vet to verify all the above information: Treasurecoastvet.com - Dr. Joel RossenJoel Rossen DVMTreasure Coast Veterinary Center1704 NW Federal HighwayStuart, FL 34994(772) 283-0235JoelRossen@gmail.comI am PRAYING, WISHING AND HOPING that Mugsy will be blessed with this dog bed. I have been contacting companies since February and NOT ONE company wants to help us. NOT ONE. I am not joking, I am not lying. That is why I am desperately entering contests and these giveaways in hopes that I will win this dog bed for my Mugsy before it is too late. I want him to live his life to the fullest and be happy every minute he is with me. I want him to enjoy every moment he has with me and my family and not be distracted by discomfort. Please let Mugsy win this, Please!August 19, 2011 at 1:31 AMMugsy5808 said...My other favorite beds for Mugsy on P.L.A.Y's website are: Footprints (Steel blue/pearl), What dogs dream (lawn green/white), Heels & Boots (Steel Grey/White), Dog on Wire (Almond/White), Dog on Wire (Midnight Blue/White), Cameo (Ivory Black/White), Chandelier (Ivory Black/White), Savannah (Ash Gray/Cool Gray), Greenery (pear/rifle green), Serengeti (Copper/Dark Grey),and big foot- mugsyviola5808@aol.com / dmviola5808@gmail.comAugust 19, 2011 at 1:48 AMMugsy5808 said...I emailed you pictures from my email - Mugsyviola5808@aol.com- mugsyviola5808@aol.com / dmviola5808@gmail.comAugust 19, 2011 at 2:14 AMMugsy5808 said...I posted the pictures also on your facebook page- mugsyviola5808@aol.com / dmviola5808@gmail.comAugust 19, 2011 at 2:14 AMMugsy5808 said...I sent a photo of my dog, 1st comment, mugsyviola5808@aol.com / dmviola5808@gmail.comAugust 19, 2011 at 2:17 AMshilohsmom said...I follow All Things Dog on Twitter. shiloh777 shiloh_acres at yahoo dot comAugust 19, 2011 at 2:18 AMshilohsmom said...I follow PetPlaySF on Twitter. shiloh777 shiloh_acres at yahoo dot comAugust 19, 2011 at 2:19 AMshilohsmom said...I tweeted today. shiloh777 shiloh_acres at yahoo dot comAugust 19, 2011 at 2:22 AMshilohsmom said...I re-tweeted today. shiloh777 shiloh_acres at yahoo dot comAugust 19, 2011 at 2:22 AMshilohsmom said...Come to think of it, maybe I like the Safari Ash Gray better.
