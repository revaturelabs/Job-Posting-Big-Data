After all, we usually need a reference and most of us find giving notice stressful enough without the showmanship.But what if you were quitting to start your own business? Would it matter then? Probably, it’s never wise to burn bridges unnecessarily, you never know who you might bump into down the line and a bad reputation can be difficult to shake off.At the Carlton Business Centre we support those brave souls who’ve quit their job (responsibly) to start their own business. If you’ve handed in your notice and need an office then get in touch, our low monthly fee with no commitment is ideal for start-up businesses.So rather than risk your own good name, take a few minutes to watch how other people quit their job in style.

Neither was a particularly enticing prospect, as we both have young families. We looked at a few serviced offices in the area, but nothing really fitted the bill – they were all either too expensive, or badly situated, or presented us with a list of “do’s and dont’s” as long as your arm……. Then the moment we stepped into Carlton Business … Read moreMike Weston | AkulaSwindon OfficesMarlborough OfficesChippenham OfficesDevizes OfficesRoyal Wootton Bassett OfficesCorsham OfficesBook Meeting RoomCarlton Business CentreMaundrell Road Calne, Wiltshire SN11 9PU Phone: 01249 816222 Email: [email protected]© 2021 Carlton Business CentreHomeAboutLocationsFeaturesAvailabilityPricingMeeting RoomBlogWe are using cookies to give you the best experience on our website.You can find out more about which cookies we are using or switch them off in settings.AcceptClose GDPR Cookie SettingsPrivacy OverviewStrictly Necessary CookiesPowered by GDPR Cookie CompliancePrivacy OverviewThis website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible.
