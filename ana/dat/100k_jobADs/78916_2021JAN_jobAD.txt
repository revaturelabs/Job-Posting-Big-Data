The concept: a company freely lends their employees to another for a predetermined amount of time. Interest is evident for the beneficiary company, but what about the lender?What’s in it for them? Let’s zoom in on the advantages of this initiative.First off, in addition to the altruistic aspect of this concept, the company can develop its employees’ skills. Organizations that turn to volunteer skills generally do so because they have an urgent issue to resolve. By authorizing employees to go assist them, you are letting them discover another activity and another way of working. It is also a way to sharpen their ability for resolving complicated situations… an ability from which they can then benefit.Secondly, you are helping another organization, often an NGO or other type of association, to become more efficient. If it’s a company for which you work regularly, your helping hand will be a future benefit to the relationship. Look at it as a long-term investment: by supporting them today, you will be more productive together in the future.Lastly, the advantage in terms of communication is not insignificant, since such an initiative can only have a positive impact on your image as a company and above all as an employer.Precautions to takeCaution: this is not about doing whatever you want. For example, be sure to remain in contact with the beneficiary organization during the entire project, since communication is key to success. Also avoid putting yourself in an urgent situation. Time for adapting will inevitably be necessary, both for the borrowed employee and for the company which they are assisting. It is not a question of entrusting employees to an ultra-specialized company in a sector for which they know nothing, since they risk being even more lost than the company that needs their help!Latest articles by Séverine DegallaixThe Right Answers to 6 Main Interview QuestionsEquality: Employees and Employers Disagree on Progress77% of Employees Are Ready to Leave to Improve Their Well-BeingTop 20 Good Professional Resolutions for 2020Do You Know How to Integrate Immigrant Workers?CommentsReceive the Hrjob.ca monthly newsletterSubscribe meYou have subscribed to the Hrjob.ca newsletter.You are already subscribed to the newsletter.An error has occurred, please try again.Search articlesSearchJob categoriesBy the numbersCall to orderCareer managementCompany lifeEntrepreneurshipFileGood to knowInterviewInterviewJob postingJobs searchNewNewsNewsNot to be missedOddly enoughOddly enoughOpinionPay and benefitsResumeRights and labour standardsTo ReadTo seeToolboxTrainingLatest articlesReport on hirings and dismissals - January 2021Knowing how to tame independence in teleworking5 characteristics of a good leaderCOVID-19 Special - Report on hirings and dismissals - December 2020How to prevent skills from becoming obsoleteEmployers of choiceCroix Bleue MedavieParklandQuadRealScotiabankSuncor EnergyBrowse by LocationTorontoVancouverMontrealOttawaMississaugaWinnipegCalgaryEdmontonHalifaxNewmarketBrowse by EmployerBrowse by CategoryHealth, Security, DisabilityRecruitment, StaffingGeneralistTraining - Development - ImprovementProductivity, Performance, EfficiencyPayrollCompensation -BenefitsHRIS, ATSLabor Relations - LegalOrganizational DevelopmentAboutContactPost a JobFrequently Asked QuestionsTerms and conditionsfacebook-icontwitter-iconVector Smart ObjectProudly made and taxedin Montreal, Qc, Canadasince 2001© 2021 jobWings Careers.
