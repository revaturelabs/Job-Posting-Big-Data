Although our warehouse is fully air-conditioned, these more fragile items are put in cold storage (freezer or refrigeration unit) for maximum freshness.Our receiving department does its best to verify and then enter the correct expiration dates for all incoming products. However, discrepancies do occur from time to time. This being said, the exceptionally high turnover at iHerb ensures that our inventory is among the freshest in the industry.Date First Available: May 2007Shipping Weight:?0.54 kgSwitch to Imperial unitsShipping WeightThe Shipping Weight includes the product, protective packaging material and the actual shipping box. In addition, the Shipping Weight may be adjusted for the Dimensional Weight (e.g. length, width & height) of a package. It is important to note that certain types of products (e.g. glass containers, liquids, fragile, refrigerated or ice packed) will often require protective packaging material. As such, these products will reflect a higher Shipping Weight compared to the unprotected product.Product Code: NOW-07718UPC Code: 733739077189Package Quantity: 16 fl ozDimensions:19.8 x 7.4 x 7.4 cm , 0.45 kgSwitch to Imperial unitsProduct Rank:#8 in Jojoba >#15 in Carrier Oils >Frequently Purchased TogetherCustomers Also ViewedProduct OverviewDescription100% Pure Moisturizing OilFor Skin, Hair & BodyMulti-PurposeCondition: In need of healthier hair, softer skin, or an oil for general bath care and massage.Solution: 100% Pure Jojoba Oil is derived from the seed of the jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) shrub and is one of the most popular cosmetic oils available today.
