So they memorized how to “solve” itOnly American exams would give almost identical problems to students' study material.7 months ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 1 No Jab !Economiste34eThe papers aren’t about proving stuff. They are about solving. Ofc we were taught the definition etc of derivative but the intuition wasn’t there at all. It was a lot of chapters from chain rule to substitution techniques for derivatives. There was no intuition. The basic example of this being how to calculate the derivative of What is given on the paper above. Why those rules happen was foreign to everyone in class. We had a 500 page book of math from the basic formulas of standard deviation to some really tough questions on integrationEvery country says that about their exams. Why did you go to the us and not stay on in China if the education there is so good. As a south Asian I knew how to “Solve’ all these questions because I knew the rules and the theorems had been memorised by me but unfortunately didn’t know what derivative actually meant. Same for the students I came across.Germans and Italians did so much better than the Chinese in math at university. Surprisingly the ones who did well even studied classics in high school.If you didn't even know what derivative means then I wonder how you managed to get into a university (without cheating).7 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 1 No Jab !Economist91aaThe papers aren’t about proving stuff.

We have, like, these terms. We seem to be adding them. There are fractions, some nasty fractions there. We got an inequality, things being raised to power. There's something related to derivatives we are not sure. Nobody likes this! You probably don't like this. Mathematicians don't like this. What are mathematicians excited about?
