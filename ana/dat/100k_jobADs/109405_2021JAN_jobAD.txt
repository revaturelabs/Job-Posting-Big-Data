We love how fashion brings back old looks and turns them into something new and exciting. Check out these jewellery trends to stay on trend this season.Chunky RingsSometimes more is more, as is the case with chunky rings. The trick to mastering this trend is to not be too tacky, instead you want the look to be clean and effortless. We love how these rings never go out of style. With this trend, don’t be afraid to mix up different metals, colours and sizes. For those who want to keep the look simple, layer the rings on just one finger.Rose Gold JewelleryRose gold jewellery is very trendy right now. Available in all shapes, sizes and styles, this is the perfect metal to play around with. Pair your rose accessories with nude and beige tones to really bring out this unique colour. We love mixing over-sized watches with a range of chunky bangles. Finish your look with some chunky mixed metal rings.Abstract JewelleryAbstract jewellery features oddly shaped and brightly coloured pieces. These pieces are showstoppers on their own, so we recommend keeping it simple. Wear abstract jewellery as a centre piece and minimise other accessories. Brightly coloured pieces really stand out against neutral shades, so pair your abstract earrings with a black, white or gray maxi dress for a fashionable summer look.Facial Piercings And Bedazzled MakeupBody modification has grown in popularity in recent years. It seems almost everyone now has a facial piercing of some sort. Currently, the most popular face piercings are labret, eyebrow, snake bites, angel bites, dimple and septum piercings. These are made stylish with both simple and intricate rings. But if you don’t want to commit to a facial piercing, accessorise your face with bedazzled make up. This trend has been made popular by the Showmax series, Euphoria.Chunky Big EarringsAnother one of our firm favourites when it comes to statement pieces are definitely chunky big earrings. These can be perfectly suited to any season and any outfit. Wear your chunky earrings with a minimalist outfit and tie back your hair to make them stand out even more.Bedazzled Hair AccessoriesHair accessories have made a huge come back. But now they are bedazzled. Keep this look simple and accessorise with just a few of these beautiful gems.Spread the loveReport Inappropriate PostDid you like this article?
