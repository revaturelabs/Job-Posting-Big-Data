Frank	Photo by IannyBoyThe feeling of losing your job is a terrifying one. This is something that has been taking up 40 hours of your week, possibly for years on end. Even if you have known it is coming, the sudden feeling of being rudderless is inevitable.But now is not the time to wallow in it. What you actually have is an opportunity, because now you get to decide your next steps. So few of us manage to make big changes in our career, because when we are in it, we settle.We’re less likely to take the big jump to doing something different because we are too used to the regular pay, the people, the hours. Now, you can break free of this – yes, it’s not of your choosing, but seize the opportunity nevertheless.To gain a little more direction, it’s time to review the next steps to getting through this turbulent time.Step 1: What Do You Want To Do With Your Life?If you were already in the industry you wanted to work in, then skip to the second step. If, however, you have been wondering if a change is needed, now is the time to go through it.Think about the things you enjoy and if there is any way they can become a career, rather than going back into the same old thing. If you like to exercise, then maybe the next step is to become a personal trainer, seeking accreditation through the likes of origympersonaltrainercourses.co.uk. Or perhaps you have always wanted to study more and move into an academic field, meaning it’s time to browse www.universalcollegeapp.com/ and find something that appeals.Step 2: Do You Need To Add Anything To Your Resume?Even if you want to stay in your existing industry, that doesn’t mean your career doesn’t need sprucing up. We mentioned total career change accreditations above, but there’s also supplementary courses. This can be things to demonstrate your skills with the Microsoft Office package. Even if you can do it, having a recognised qualification is far more potent to employers than just saying you can. This is proof of it, so it’s worth investing if it brings you bang up to date.Step 3: Talking of Your Resume…If you were in the role you lost for a long time, chances are your resume needs some sprucing up. There is plenty of advice online about ways to do this, but the general rule is to stand out. Tailor your resume to each application you intend to make rather than saving a generic template.Step 4: Don’t Make Rash DecisionsAll of the above are well and good, but they need consideration. You’re in panic mode; suddenly unemployed and wanting just to take action to make yourself feel better. This is not a time for hot-headed thinking. Take a calm assessment and sleep on any choices you make for a few nights. Charging forward for little more than the sake of going forward is not going to have good results. You’ve got time; so use it, and only apply or accept jobs when you’re ready.This post has been contributed by Ryan Gatt, it may contain affiliate links.Share this:ShareFacebookTwitterRedditEmailLinkedInPrintLike this:Like Loading...RelatedThis entry was posted in Uncategorized.
