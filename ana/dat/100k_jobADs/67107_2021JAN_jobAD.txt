If for some reason this is not possible then we will accept CVs, relevant online profiles (LinkedIn etc.), or an email to recruitmentteam@theverygroup.comHow do I apply for a role?You can find all open and available positions on our careers site. For future roles or if there is a role that you are interested in but cannot see live, please check the team pages on our careers site where you'll be able to add yourself to our talent pool/talent pipeline.Once you find a position that suits your skills and ambitions, please click ‘Apply’.You can apply either by creating a profile, submitting your CV or using your LinkedIn profile. Please note that our Talent Acquisition team and relevant agency partners may also be proactive and reach out to talented individuals who have not applied for vacancies.If there is a mutual interest, we'll ask you to store your personal data in Cornerstone or alternatively to formally apply for the job via email.Are all job ads current?If you see a role published on our careers page, LinkedIn or relevant job boards, advertised directly by The Very Group, you can assume it is still current.However, some job portals do scrape our job ads from our career page independently which means we can't ensure the accuracy of their status. It’s always best to check directly on our careers website.How do I know the closing date and can I apply after it?Closing dates for applications are usually listed at the top of our job ads. Sometimes, we may have multiple live roles live under one job ad, so the target date may be ongoing until all of those roles are filled.Please note that if we find the right number and quality of applicants sooner than we expect, the application process may be closed earlier than the original deadline. So, we encourage you to apply as soon as you notice the advert!Can I apply for more than one position?Yes! The best way to do this is to create a profile on our careers site and mark your details as searchable by the Talent Acquisition team. Then apply for each position you're interested in.We'll consider your application for each role, and you may need to deal with multiple people in the Talent Acquisition Team.What’s the minimum requirement for submitting a job application?Each role has its own specific requirements. However, to be able to submit an application, the only thing we require is your basic contact information (name, email, phone number) and a CV or LinkedIn profile. We also find that a customised cover letter adds great value too - so bear that in mind!Will you tell me when a job has been filled?We do try and notify each and every candidate about the outcome of the application. However, we do not email all applicants when a job has been filled. You can track the overall status when you log in to the candidate home screen via the careers website. If you need any more information, please email us at: recruitmentteam@theverygroup.comWho can see my profile and application?If you're an external candidate, your profile and application is visible only to the responsible member of the Talent Acquisition team and colleagues involved in the selection process (Hiring Manager & Hiring Team).If you explicitly opt to make your profile available, other members of the Talent Acquisition team will be able to search our database using relevant keywords, and could access your application profile in this way too.Can I apply from another country?We understand that in order to recruit the best talent we cannot always do this locally or domestically. So, we do accept relevant applications from other countries outside of the UK and Europe.For successful remote candidates, we'll usually hold interviews by phone or by video channels, and we'll carry out parts of the initial assessment remotely.However, the process will vary by job requirements, work location, and your current location. The member of the Talent Acquisition team responsible for the role will be on hand to help.If a role can offer sponsorship it will be listed within the job description.If you need more information, please email the recruitmentteam@shopdirect.comAfter submitting my application, can I edit my information or add anything?If you'd like to make changes, please reach out to the relevant contact person or recruiter so that they can edit the application in our system on your behalf.I'm no longer able to attend my interview on the date given. Is it possible to request a different interview date?If you're able to provide at least 48 hours’ notice then this may be possible in some circumstances, but due to time constraints and availability we may be unable to provide alternative interview dates.I’ve interviewed already. How long will it be before I hear if I was successful?We aim to provide initial feedback within 48 hours of the interview unless otherwise notified. We'll inform all successful and unsuccessful applicants within two weeks of the interview.If there is a considerable delay, we'll contact all candidates to keep them updated.Do you reimburse interview travel expenses?Unfortunately, we are generally unable to reimburse travel expenses. However, there may be occasions when we can offer this, but this must be discussed in advance.I have been invited to an interview, and have been asked to bring an in-date passport. I do not have this. What should I do?If you do not have a passport, please bring an original copy of your full birth certificate. For Employment Law purposes, copies are not acceptable, and you must bring the original documents with you. Please note that we won't ask you to leave them with us. We will also need to confirm your nationality and right to work in the UK meets our requirements before an offer of employment can be made.Is it possible to have feedback on my application when I was not successful?Unfortunately, due to the high numbers of applications we receive, we're unable to give feedback to those applicants who do not reach interview stage.I was not successful for a particular role, will my details be considered for other roles?During your initial application / profile creation we'll ask you if your details can be searchable by our Talent Acquisition Team. Please remember to tick this box if you'd like to be considered for other roles.In addition, the member of the Talent Acquisition team who you initially deal with may consider you for other roles at this time and ask whether you would like to add your application to our Talent Pool.Once you confirm you wish to be considered, we'll contact you as soon as we have other suitable opportunities. You can also continue to apply for other vacancies whenever they are advertised on our careers site.How long after my interview will it take before I know the outcome?This very much depends on the hiring team and how many candidates they see over a period of time.Interviews are usually spread over a few days and sometimes weeks, so we need to ensure we have spoken to all relevant candidates before making a full decision.Where possible, a member of the Talent Acquisition team may be able to provide some initial and informal feedback.You’ve mentioned internal candidates. If there are internal candidates applying for the role, is it worth me applying?Our recruitment process is comprehensive and often modular, depending on the role. This allows all candidates equal opportunity to make the case for their fit within the role or team.Candidates are thoroughly assessed against the key requirements for the role and the core competencies, as well as for culture fit and personality. We then select the most suitable candidate, and we'll offer them the position, regardless of whether they are internal or external.Can I withdraw my application from my account?Yes, you can log in to withdraw your application. Alternatively, please contact us if you no longer wish to be considered for the position(s) you have applied for and we'll remove your application right away.How do I delete my profile data?You can ask us to remove your personal data by sending an email to recruitmentteam@theverygroup.comIs there an appeals process against non-selection?No, unfortunately there is no right to appeal against decisions made through our selection process.For anything else, please drop us a line to recruitmentteam@theverygroup.com and we'll do our best to help.The interviewOur recruitment processFAQsLatest rolesInternal Communications Manager (12 month FTC)PeopleLiverpoolREAD MOREInventory ControllerOperationsDerbyREAD MOREHead of Technology - RetailTechnologyLiverpoolREAD MORESEE ALL ROLESLet's do this!APPLY NOWPrivacy PolicyCookiesSite Maptheverygroup.com© The Very Group 2021.
