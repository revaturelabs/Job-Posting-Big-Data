This includes women, because they make up over 50 percent of America’s population.”USA Today reports the ban on women performing in combat operations will be lifted in 30 days, following months of debate after a Marine Corps study on women’s performance in combat showed units without women out-performed those with women during tactical exercises.The study, released in September, was conducted over a nine-month period. During the exercises, women were shown to be injured more often, move more slowly through tactical obstacles, and fire their weapons less accurately.Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, who manages both the U.S. Navy and the Marine Corps, spoke in favor of opening all combat positions to women in September, saying he would not ask Secretary Carter for exemptions in either branch.“This is being done for political reasons,” said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., a member of the House Armed Services Committee. “What is it going to do to our ability to be lethal at the small-unit level? It degrades that ability.”Prior to Carter’s announcement, the U.S. Armed Forces prohibited roughly 220,000 military jobs to women, amounting to about 10 percent of all military roles.By Ryan MaassUPI NEWSBreakingNEWSworld newsRussian pipeline through Turkey on holdReese Witherspoon, Crosby, Stills & Nash join first family for National Christmas Tree LightingSyria conflict: Shells hit Russian embassy compoundAugust 26, 2015iPhone 6s: The 10 most exciting new featuresAugust 28, 2015Migrant deaths: UN warns of ‘crisis of solidarity’August 28, 2015Masoud Barzani meets with US Joint Chiefs chairmanAugust 29, 2015Syria crisis: Turkey downs ‘drone’ on Syria borderSeptember 3, 2015Poverty will kill more people than coronavirusNovember 15, 2020Children over 12 should wear face masks to combat Covid, says WHOAugust 23, 2020Coronavirus: Italy cases spike as infections exceed 1,000 for the first time since lockdown easedAugust 23, 2020Gavin Williamson was at the seaside as exam fiasco unfoldedAugust 23, 2020COVID-19 doesn’t seem to be everywhere yet.
