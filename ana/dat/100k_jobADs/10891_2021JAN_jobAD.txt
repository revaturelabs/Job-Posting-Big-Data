A higher-up, who is not my boss, told me I was going to have to go pick up the lunch for the meeting participants at noon and that she’d give me the money. This is not in my job description, and I was not excited to play errand girl, but I am at the bottom of the totem pole. Noon came and went and no one came out of the meeting. Finally around 1 p.m. I went to the break room to eat my lunch with friends. Shortly afterward the higher-up found me, stood in the doorway, and waved money at me indicating it was time to go. I thought she was rude and I waved my sandwich at her, indicating I was on my break. She stormed out and picked up the lunch herself. Later she furiously insisted to my boss that I be fired. My boss doesn’t think I should be, but he told me to try not to piss off this woman anymore. As the new young staffer is it my job to just suck it up? Or did I merely set boundaries with a disrespectful colleague who sorely needs them?—WonderingDear WonderingI understand your concern. You were told you needed to pick up lunch for the meeting. The meeting ran an hour late so you waved your sandwich at a co worker, and refused to pick up the lunch. I recommend that you improve your sandwich waving skills. You may need them. Unless you are in California then never mind.. Hope this helps.EVShare this:ShareFacebookPinterestLike this:Like Loading...RelatedTags: ask the eye, Subway SandwichThis entry was posted on April 30, 2012 at 7:47 am and is filed under Uncategorized.
