Located in the basement of the historic Thunder Walker venue, Zwipi Underground is the most astonishing bank vault, turned into a bar and lounge.Zwipi Underground is a beautiful and mysterious space, perfect for private parties. Boasting the original steel vault structure, circa 1904, with several booths and over 1000 mostly unopened safety deposit boxes, Zwipi Underground is a place to cherish and enjoy.Pre or post dinner drinksThunder Walker dinner guests can enjoy drinks in the Zwipi Underground before or after dinner (if Covid-19 curfew restrictions allow).Exquisite set-menu private dinnersGuests can also book the private dining room or the private vault booths in the Zwipi Underground for an exquisite and exceptional dinner experience.Private dining roomsMany people prefer to dine in private, especially in this time of physical distancing but desperately needed social connection.
