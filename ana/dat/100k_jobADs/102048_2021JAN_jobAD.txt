Despite this, we are so pleased to have been able to continue our recruitment drive and employ new team members during the past eight months to meet the growing demand for our products.Jason McKittrick was one of our new starts during the pandemic who joined us in April past as a Production Technician in the imaging division of Cirdan. As part of the production team, Jason works on building and testing our imaging products such as the PathLite and CoreLite devices which are all currently manufactured in-house at our headquarters in Lambeg, Northern Ireland. We recently caught up with Jason on his experience of starting a new job during the COVID-19 pandemic.Have you found any challenges starting a new job during the COVID-19 Pandemic?As the majority of people are working from home, I haven’t been able to get to know everyone who would usually work in the office yet. The production team has been continuing to carry out essential work throughout and my day-to-day work has not been affected, so everything else has just been like starting a job despite the unusual circumstances!What do you like most about working at Cirdan?I have to say the working environment is very relaxed, you’re allowed to do your job and get it done. If you have any concerns or you need any help, everyone is approachable, and you can go to them to ask for help and guidance when needed. Everyone at Cirdan is really open, for example it’s not unusual to sit and have lunch with the CEO and talk about football and normal life things. In my opinion, the work atmosphere is second to none. I’ve had four real jobs in my life now and this is certainly one of the best ones in terms of the work environment.Any advice for individuals changing jobs during a pandemic?Just make sure that it is the right job for you! It’s going to be different as you are going into a job where not everybody is in the office and you may worry if you’ve made the right decision. My advice would be to talk to the new employer and make sure that you are happy with the role that you are going into. Don’t be afraid to ask questions, after all it is unusual circumstances and we all have to start somewhere. Joining Cirdan has been a great move for me, I am proud to work for a medical technology company which is shaping the future of global healthcare, by speeding up the diagnosis of patients through their innovative range of medical devices. I look forward to meeting everyone when they come back into the office again!Thank you, Jason for those words of advice, we are delighted to have you as part of the team at Cirdan! Let’s focus on the positives from this year and move forward together!#recuitment #growingcompany #positiveoutcomesCirdan UK & IrelandRiverbank, The Green, Tullynacross Road, Lambeg, Lisburn, N Ireland, BT27 5SR U.K., Tel: +44 289266 0880 Email: info@cirdan.comCirdan’s Privacy PolicyRead Cirdan’s Privacy PolicyCirdan Canada60 Renfrew Drive, Suite 250, Markham, Ontario L3R 0E1, Canada Tel: +1 416 479 0158 Email: info@cirdan.comCirdan AustraliaSuite 8, Ballarat Technology Park – Central 106-110 Lydiard Street South, Ballarat Vic 3350 Australia Tel: +61 419 039 702 Email: info@cirdan.comAll rights reserved©2018 CirdanThis site uses cookies to help the site provide a better user experience.
