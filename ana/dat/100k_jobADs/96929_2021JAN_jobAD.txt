I joke that the iPad is intuitive enough that a baby can use it. But really, there is something significant there.When I was a kid, I was fortunate enough to have a computer at home and I was pretty good at using it. But it certainly wasn’t something everyone felt comfortable with. Computers were powerful tools, but you had to be a certain kind of person to really use them.Steve Jobs changed a lot of that. He was fond of saying that Apple was at the intersection of technology and liberal arts. But I think it was more that he was the pioneer of making technology for humans.Dyson loves the iPad and the iPhone. And it’s not just because they’re beautiful devices. It’s because there are things he wants them to do and he knows how to make them do it. For a being that only barely knows how to speak, that’s no small accomplishment.(I would also like to point out that some of his favorite apps are Mach Dice, Boom Dice, and Castle Tiles. He’s also fond of geoDefense swarm. But to be fair, he’s not very good at it.)This entry was posted on Thursday, October 6th, 2011 at 11:56 pm	and is filed under Uncategorized.
