"New Jersey doesn't know if state residents get jobs under tax breaksThe EDA does collect payroll data on a small subset of jobs, contracting and subcontracting workers. The agency then analyzed a chunk of that data: projects midway through construction that won Grow NJ tax breaks, a program that aims to boost job growth in the state. Sullivan said in a memo the EDA chose this slice because they had a massive amount of data, though the analysis would undercount certain work like foundation work or window installation.In the 25 projects in Camden County with 1,098 construction jobs the EDA analyzed: 2% of workers were Camden city residents, 26 percent were from Camden county, and 76 percent were New Jersey residents.\"These numbers speak to what we have said all along – that any incentive program must contain assurances that awards will benefit not just large companies, but also local residents and the communities in which they live,\" Murphy said in a statement. \"I’m hopeful [all Camden] companies will provide [job] data as soon as possible so we can better determine what benefits local residents have received from our significant investments.\"Camden County officials dispute the analysis, saying the data isn't representative.\"These numbers are completely skewed and disingenuous,\" said Dan Keashen, public affairs director for Camden County. \"We're dealing with additional political brinksmanship by the EDA.\"The data \"completely misses the forest for the trees, portraying one phase of Camden's economic development as the entire story,\" Camden County Freeholder Director Louis Cappelli Jr. said in a statement.The two recently-expired tax breaks aimed to spur employment and development, Grow NJ and Economic Redevelopment & Growth, do not have requirements to prioritize New Jersey or local workers to work for the companies, Sullivan said. Gov. Phil Murphy released his own five-part tax break plan to replace them, and included bonuses to encourage local hiring in a program called NJ Forward.Companies in Camden received special treatment under the programs in order to revitalize the struggling community, and doesn’t have to meet as high a standard of economic benefit to the state as other communities. Since former Gov. Chris Christie signed into law the Economic Opportunity Act, which revamped the tax break programs, companies in Camden won $1.6 billion in awards.The tax break programs have scrutinized after a WNYC/ProPublica investigation found that $1.1 billion out of the $1.6 billion of awards had a link to insurance executive George E. Norcross III, and that the law firm run by Norcross' brother had input on crafting the Economic Opportunity Act. Multiple scathing reports also found that the EDA did not have procedures set up to properly vet tax break applications or to verify the companies created the jobs they promised.Stile: Murphy gets pushback on immigrant driver's licensesBreaking: Could NJ ban the sale of vaping products?Voting: Is your vote secure? NJ ballot security put to testBut Camden officials praise the programs as helping the city and point to the city's record low 6.6 unemployment rate as proof.\"We're seeing a total transformation of the city that was named the most dangerous and poor in 2012,\" Keashen said. \"And that's minimized when you cite these numbers.\"Outrage and concern over hiring for tax break projects came after a controversial statement made by the CEO of Holtec International, a company that won $260 million in tax incentives to build a manufacturing plant in Camden.CEO Krishna Singh said Holtec couldn't find good local workers because they don't have the appropriate skills or resume.\"They don't show up to work,\" Singh told business outlet ROI-NJ. \"They can't stand getting up in the morning and coming to work every single day. They haven't done it, and they didn't see their parents do it. Of course, some of them get into drugs and things. So, it's difficult.\"A panel of experts and academics told New Jersey lawmakers that tax break programs should target currently unemployed New Jersey residents to truly be effective. They also advised lawmakers that efficiently run job training programs may give New Jersey a better deal than reducing the tax burden of companies. New Jersey spends about $66,000 per job, an average higher than most states in the country.As the two major corporate tax breaks expired this July, a Senate committee will hold another hearing Sept. 23 for input as the Legislature tries to craft replacement programs.More New Jersey newsEducation:Gov.
