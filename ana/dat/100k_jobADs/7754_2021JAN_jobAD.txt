In the Links are the currency on the web we looked at the total number of links no the web that the Link Count tool from SEOmoz would show for our 20 recruitment agency web sites. But not all the links are equal. The more I think about it, it would be fair to say that no two links are the same. One (smart) way thinking about the links is to count just the web sites that link to your web site. So if there are 2 or 2 million links from some domain to your web site it would still count as one.If we look at our 29 recruitment agency web sites list and www.JobsBlog.ie between them where is what we get:URLSites Linkinghttp://www.cpl.ie568http://www.hays.ie294http://www.morganmckinley.ie265http://www.brightwater.ie127http://www.jobsblog.ie126http://www.hrm.ie125http://www.collinsmcnicholas.ie100http://www.eolas.ie100http://www.careerwise.ie86http://www.EdenRecruitment.ie77http://www.peoplegroup.ie70http://www.frsrecruitment.com68http://www.Vantage.ie65http://www.icds.ie55http://www.Sigmar.ie51http://www.3qrecruitment.ie46http://www.rftgroup.ie44http://www.Stelfox.ie34http://www.recruitmentplus.ie32http://www.accountancysolutions.ie26http://www.Recruiters.ie19http://www.MatrixRecruitment.ie14http://www.harmonics.ie14http://www.hudson.ie13http://www.gempool.ie9http://www.qedrecruitment.ie7http://www.Brompton.ie5http://www.placeme.ie5http://www.enterprisepeople.ie5http://www.solasconsulting.ie4The results show that only 5 Irish Recruitment agencies have more web sites linking to them than this blog. If you want your jobs to be seen by as many possible job seekers and as many possible clients (employers) it would be natural to want to bring visitors from as many sites to your site. Therefore having as many web sites linking to your site would help you get more candidates and clients. As simple as that. The above table show how good are you at that particular task. If your site is not on the list, you can get this figure for your site and compare yourself with the competition.Even more important than this direct traffic of visitors that you get from other sites is the fact that from the perspective of the search engines like Google, your site the more “important” the more web sites link to your site. So the more links you have to your site – the more likely is that Google will display any content on your site above the similar content on any other web site. This is extremely important for the ranking of your jobs. When a similar job is advertised on many job boards and recruitment agency web sites, the site that will get listed on top is very often the one that has the most links from other web sites.How to get more links to your web site?Submitting your site to an online directory? – that is the most common answer I get when I do the Recruitment SEO Training. Unfortunately, the answer is always – no. Why not? The practise was abused and Google decides to in most cases ignore it, and in some cases even penalize it.Just do not buy links. Please. – That is what Google would say, and in my experience, this is the best advice possible in most cases.Spamming social media with your links. – Will make sure you get ignored, not followed by anyone but bots. Again the time and money the drain.SO WHAT THEN?Think about what links do you click at on the web.You might click on a link in the article you are reading on some site. If you are reading a review on some blog, about the new tool the LinkedIn has launched, and there is a link to that tool within the article – you might click it. Ask yourself how did that article ended up on a publication you are reading? Can you submit your content there? With a link to something new and cool on your web site? If you are thinking of PR submissions at this stage, I can tell you, you are on the wrong track. Think of guest blog posts. Think of the places where different people publish content. You are probably getting where I am going with this… yes the combined name of all such sites is Social Media.Tags irish recruitment agencies, Recruitment Agency, www.accountancysolutions.ie, www.brightwater.ie, www.Brompton.ie, www.careerwise.ie, www.collinsmcnicholas.ie, www.cpl.ie, www.EdenRecruitment.ie, www.enterprisepeople.ie, www.eolas.ie, www.frsrecruitment.com, www.gempool.ie, www.harmonics.ie, www.hays.ie, www.hrm.ie, www.hudson.ie, www.icds.ie, www.jobsblog.ie, www.MatrixRecruitment.ie, www.morganmckinley.ie, www.peoplegroup.ie, www.placeme.ie, www.qedrecruitment.ie, www.Recruiters.ie, www.recruitmentplus.ie, www.rftgroup.ie, www.Sigmar.ie, www.solasconsulting.ie, www.Stelfox.ie, www.Vantage.ie	By Ivan | JobsBlog.ie	Ivan A.
