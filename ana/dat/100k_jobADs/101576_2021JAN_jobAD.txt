These dynamic components are smart enough to read the binding metadata and render themselves on the fly. Please read this topic 22.7 Using a Dynamic Form to Determine Data to Display at Runtime, to learn more about this feature. When we talk about the dynamism provided by the ADF Rich Client, story is incomplete without referring support from the ADF BC (business service) layer. You can create dynamic EntityObject, ViewObject and wire them to UI components declaratively, without much effort. In this post, I'm discussing some common 'dynamic UI' based use case requirements and their solutions using ADF.Case 1: Dynamic UI Table built using dynamic ViewObject(database table and attribute definitions change for each invocation)Use case requirement: UI needs to be populated from different database tables, based on various business conditions. Number of displayed attributes may vary based on source database table.Solution : Solution is pretty straight forward. Let us start from the business service layer and then move towards UI layer.Business Service LayerYou can make use of ApplicationModule::createViewObjectFromQueryStmt(java.lang.String voName, java.lang.String sqlStatement) to define dynamic ViewObjects using the query supplied by the run time.Binding LayerNext step is to wire this dynamic ViewObject with UI. Define the necessary binding in your page definition file. You may need to do it manually as we are creating the ViewObject dynamically.Sample page definition is shown below. <executables>    <variableIterator id=\"variables\"/>    <iterator Binds=\"DynamicQueryVO\" DataControl=\"AppModuleDataControl\"              id=\"DynamicVOIterator\"/>  </executables>  <bindings>    <tree IterBinding=\"DynamicVOIterator\" id=\"DynamicVO\">      <nodeDefinition Name=\"Dummy\"></nodeDefinition>    </tree>  </bindings>UI LayerFor building dynamic UI, either you can use <af:table> along with <af:foreach> to populate table on the fly, or simply leave the job to <dynamic:table> component. Let the component do the job for you. If you need to display the data in a dynamic parameter form, you can use <dynamic:form>Dynamic components differ from standard components in that all the binding metadata is created at run time. This dynamic building of the bindings allows you set display information using control hints on a view object instead of configuring the information in the Edit Form Fields dialog as you drop the control onto the pageTable populated using <af:foreach> is shown below <af:table rows=\"#{bindings.DynamicVO.rangeSize}\"    fetchSize=\"#{bindings.DynamicVO.rangeSize}\"    emptyText=\"#{bindings.DynamicVO.viewable ? 'No data to display.' : 'Access Denied.'}\"    var=\"row\" rowBandingInterval=\"0\"    value=\"#{bindings.DynamicVO.collectionModel}\"    selectedRowKeys=\"#{bindings.DynamicVO.collectionModel.selectedRow}\"    selectionListener=\"#{bindings.DynamicVO.collectionModel.makeCurrent}\"    rowSelection=\"single\" id=\"t1\">    <af:forEach items=\"#{bindings.DynamicVOIterator.attributeDefs}\"        var=\"def\">      <af:column headerText=\"#{def.name}\" sortable=\"true\"         sortProperty=\"#{def.name}\" id=\"c1\">    <af:outputText value=\"#{row[def.name]}\" id=\"ot1\"/>      </af:column>    </af:forEach>  </af:table>Using dynamic:table to display dynamic contents is shown below.<dynamic:table value=\"#{bindings.DynamicVOIterator}\" id=\"t3\"/>Case 2: Dynamic UI Table built using ViewObject with dynamic query(Only database table changes, attribute definitions/column types may remain same)Use case requirement: UI needs to be populated from different database tables, but attribute definition remains same. In other words, only the table changes, number of columns and types remain same.Solution :Business Service LayerHere you just need to swap only the query part of the ViewObject. The attribute definitions remains same for all cases. You can use ViewObject::setQuery(java.lang.String query) to set Sets the user-defined query.Building UI and the binding this with ViewObject remains same as for the normal implementation.Case 3: Updatable Dynamic UI Table built using Dynamic EntityObject and ViewObjectUse case requirement: Needs to build an updatable UI based on the database table and attributes which are decided at run time.Solution : This is a bit tricky situation. As the table is updatable, there should be an EntityObject to post the changes back to database.Business Service LayerSolution is to build EntityObject and corresponding ViewObject dynamically based on the metadata supplied by the run time.(Thanks to Steve who shared a sample on similar topic)Below given sample code builds EntityObjects and corresponding ViewObject on the fly.EntityDefImpl newEntity = new EntityDefImpl(DYNAMIC_EO);newEntity.setSource(\"EMPLOYEES\");AttributeDefImpl newAttrDef1 =newEntity.addAttribute(\"EmployeeId\", \"EMPLOYEE_ID\", Number.class,true, false, true);ViewDefImpl newView = new ViewDefImpl(DYNAMIC_VO);newView.addEntityUsage(\"e\", DYNAMIC_EO, false, false);newView.addAllEntityAttributes(\"e\");newView.setFetchSize((short)30);newView.setSelectClauseFlags(ViewDefImpl.CLAUSE_GENERATE_RT);newView.setWhereClauseFlags(ViewDefImpl.CLAUSE_GENERATE_RT);newView.setFromClauseFlags(ViewDefImpl.CLAUSE_GENERATE_RT);newView.resolveDefObject();newView.registerDefObject();Binding Layer'UI Wiring' part is same as discussed under Case 1.UI LayerSame as discussed under Case 1.ConclusionADF offers a library of dynamic components which may help you to build dynamic UI without much effort. You may need to choose the right implementation strategy based on your use case requirement.You can download the sample workspace from here.[Runs with Oracle JDeveloper 11g R1 PS2 + HR Schema]How to run this sample?Run the main.jspx. Main page display menu(link) for each case that we discussed here. You can select Department/Employee from the drop down list and then opt for one of the three cases by clicking the corresponding links. This takes you to a result page where data is rendered in a tabular form. This UI is generated on the fly based on the item selected from the drop down.Learn More ...There are a lot more points like this. If you are curious to learn the internals of the ADF Business Components and ADF Binding Layer, the following book is for you - Oracle ADF Real World Developerâ€™s Guide.More details about this book can be found in this post- http://jobinesh.blogspot.in/2012/07/pre-order-your-copy-of-oracle-adf-real.htmlGet linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther AppsCommentsshankar August 26, 2010 at 5:42 AMIts a very nice post indeed and a real-time scenario.

As mentioned by you I used for doin this. To the table added a binding too. From the binding setter i'm calling createdynamictable() method which take cares of creating a table programmatically. This is working fine indiviually. Now I addef two SOC on the page. After selecting the value from the first list it again calls the createdynamictable() method which leads to null pointer. I think the collectionModel is the reason for the complete page refresh on performing some other action. So I removed the table binding and added the createdynamictable() method call to getCollectiomModel(). Now the SOC is working fine and not leading to the null pointer. But the table is not being created.

In your example you are using this technique to remove the view and clear the cache:internalDynamicVO.remove();getDBTransaction().clearEntityCache(DYNAMIC_EO);removeEntityCacheByDefName(DYNAMIC_EO);getTransaction().rollback();so why do you clear the cache at all if it is removed in the next line? Is this necessary? In my case it is causing:JBO-25303: Cannot clear entity cache dynamic.EO because it has modified rowson dbTrans.clearEntityCache(DYNAMIC_EO) when I want to reset the view object.The problem is solved when I callremoveEntityCacheByDefName(DYNAMIC_EO);beforedbTrans.clearEntityCache(DYNAMIC_EO);Is this ok?ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyJobinesh Purushothaman August 8, 2013 at 4:59 AMÅ‚ukaszGThanks for pointing it out.Alternatively, you can try calling getTransaction().rollback(); as first statement before clearing cache.

It says that the attribute (which I am trying to sort) is not found in the DynamicVO.I tried to find what the issue might be but could not find it.Only difference between your demo and my application is that the string that I pass for dynamic VO creation(input text) and the table itself is on the same page.So for the dynamic vo to work , I have a default activity in my taskflow which creates the dynamic VO from \"Select * from dual\" query. Then when the user has entered the actual query on the page, I create the VO again with that query.Any pointers as to why I am getting oracle.jbo.NoDefException: JBO-25058 and your sample app does not?ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAdd commentLoad more...Post a CommentDisclaimerThe views expressed on this blog are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer.Powered by BloggerTheme images by DNY59Jobinesh PurushothamanVisit profileArchiveJuly 20201April 20201March 20201February 20201January 20206September 20191May 20191February 20191January 20196October 20181December 20171August 20171March 20171December 20161September 20152June 20151May 20151August 20142July 20145June 20146May 20143April 20142March 20145February 20141January 20143December 20133November 20136October 20131September 20131August 20134July 20135June 20133May 20139April 20132March 20136February 20136January 20135December 20127November 20121October 20121September 20123August 20121July 20122June 20122May 20122April 20122March 20124February 20127January 20124December 20113November 20111October 20114September 20116August 20114July 201111June 201113May 20119April 201112March 201113February 20115January 20118December 20108November 20109October 20107September 20109August 20106July 20104June 20108May 20108April 20102March 20103February 20102January 20102December 20093November 20094October 20092September 20092August 20094July 20092June 20092Show more Show lessTopicsHelidon7 Microservice6 MicroProfile5 Kubernetes4 Java3 CNCF2 Docker2 GraphQL2 JSF2 Kafka2Minikube2 Istio1 JAX-RS1 Java EE1 JavaScript Security1 MongoDB1 MySQL1 Node.js1 OAuth1Show more Show less"
