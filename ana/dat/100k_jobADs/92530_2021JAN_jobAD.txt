Their employment can be contractual or temporary . Industrial and commercial organizations , research institutions and other organizations may require translators to handle correspondence with foreign parties , to finalize contracts and deals. The best and most lucrative prospect for translators is to set up an agency with a group of linguists and handle translating assignments in a variety of languages and subjects. Freelancers may be attached to such agencies. Prospects are good for such agencies and for freelancers in the commercial centers of the country. Remuneration depend on the level of difficulty , intricacy , urgency and specialization needed for the translating assignment.Interpreting requires a high degree of fluency and special skills to handle conversations and discussions spontaneously without hesitation so as not to interrupt the flow.
