It's fun that the Chiefs are finally good enough to now build their team beat Denver, and vice versa.If Ben Grubbs comes back healthy, the Chiefs are beginning to build a pretty good OL. LT is still an issue, but Fisher is starting to show improvement. I don't think he will ever be the guy worth the first pick in the draft, though.Otherwise, it was good Day of FA in KC. Like They kept Derrick Johnson, Jaye Howard, as well as another pass reserve pass rusher. There were rumors going that they had a shot in keeping Sean Smith, too.

Let me quote from Cleveland.com.1. Mitchell Schwartz: The Browns made Schwartz an offer shortly before the NFL Combine that was far below what he felt he could get on the open market. Sources said it was somewhere in the $7 million-a-year range. His agent, Deryk Gilmore, told the Browns that the former second-round pick would test free agency. Schwartz' goal was about $8 million to $10 million a year, taking into account the growing importance of the position against the Von Millers of the world. When Schwartz opted to test the market, the Browns assumed he was gone and turned their attention to other players.But Gilmore told cleveland.com Thursday that Schwartz wanted to return to Cleveland and wishes he could've stayed. His fiancee is from here, he purchased a house here and he's entrenched in the community. After testing the market, which wasn't good for right tackles, Schwartz went back to the Browns in the hours before free agency and ultimately planned to accept their pre-combine offer. But they were informed by Cleveland that the offer no longer stood, at least not at $7 million a year. It may have been posturing on the Browns' part, but any hopes of reaching a deal were apparently dashed when NFL Network reported Wednesday morning that the Browns had pulled their offer.Feeling Cleveland was no longer an option, Schwartz opted to sign a five-year, $33 million deal with the Chiefs, including about $15 million guaranteed. His brother, Geoff Schwartz, congratulated him on the deal after the \"nonsense'' he endured during the day, presumably from the Browns. NFL Network's Mike Silver reported that the Browns didn't negotiate in good faith.In the end, the Browns had moved on before Wednesday when Schwartz opted to test the market without engaging with their $7 million offer. For Schwartz' part, it's common for a player to shop a team's number in hopes of making more.Ultimately, he didn't, at least not in terms of yearly average. The $6.6 million a year average makes him the second-highest paid right tackle in the NFL, but it's short of the payday he was hoping for. The Browns now have to hope that Austin Pasztor can step in, or they need to find a replacement. Bottom line: It didn't have to come to this. The Browns were willing to pay Schwartz $7 million a year, more than he's getting from the Chiefs. His $15 million guaranteed from Kansas City is more than what the Browns were offering, but a deal could've been struck had things not gotten ugly on Wednesday. It's unfortunate for both sides.Come on, people. Just because you were hired by Cleveland doesn't mean you have to act like all the other buffoons who've been through the doors.Also, Alex Mack is making more than Schwartz. That blows my mind.NSMike wrote:How did I live before digital distribution of old, cheap games?MilkmanDanimal wrote:You did live before digital distribution of old, cheap games.

That didn't happen because Cleveland. Even when Cleveland drafts smart in the 1st round, they don't turn out quite right.

The trigger for the rest of the deal is a $10.5 million portion of his $13.5 million salary in 2018 – guaranteed for injury only at signing – that would become fully guaranteed of the fifth day of the 2018 league year. So, the Jaguars will have a choice at that point on whether the former Denver Broncos defensive end is worth the investment. The rest of Jackson’s deal is non-guaranteed base salaries -- $13 million in 2019, $13.75 million in 2020 and $13.75 million in 2021 – with $1.5 million in escalators each of those last three years to reach the maximum value of $90 million.Once again, it's the \"guarantee the first two years of salary\" trick, along with a cut-by deadline additional salary guarantee going into year 3.GWJFFL Trophy Case:Dynasty: 2012, 2013Pro: 2013\"The golden shower threw me off.\" -- garion333*Legion*Posted: March 10, 2016 8:54 PMPermalinkHead CoachS4n74 M4r14, CASteelers sign Ladarius Green, which possibly knocks Jesse James off my dynasty keepers.GWJFFL Trophy Case:Dynasty: 2012, 2013Pro: 2013\"The golden shower threw me off.\" -- garion333Pages« first‹ previous…5678910111213…next ›last »You are hereHome » Forums » Sports Discussion and Leagues"
