They have a wide variety of foods, ranging from burgers to pastas. They pride themselves on using fresh ingredients and quality culinary tools to serve you the tastiest food possible! One of their most popular menu items is a traditional Venezuelan plate: the fried plantain sandwich, which was featured on the latest World Food Trucks episode.To make the fried plantain sandwich, they first start off with ground beef or chicken. They usually use fried plantains, giving you two of them per plate. The plantains are fried, formed into the flat “bun” (base) and then fried again to get them extra golden. They add tartar sauce, tomato, lettuce, and the meat. That is then topped off with melted mozzarella cheese. You can add cheddar and parmesan for even more cheesy goodness! It makes a little “burger” when you top it with the other half of the fried plantain. You even eat it like a regular sandwich!Owner Jose Miguel does both Venezuelan and Italian food, since he also works with pasta. There’s also items like papas locas (essentially loaded fries) and tequenos (Venezuelan cheese sticks) on the menu. He’s been at the World Food Truck Market for only a year and a half, but his truck is one of the most popular. You can find them on social media, both on Facebook (Super Grill Food Truck) and Instagram at the handle: @SuperGrillFT.Visit World Food Trucks at 5811 W.
