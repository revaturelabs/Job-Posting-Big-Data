There are also few partnerships as fraught with peril or as likely to veer off course and lose their effectiveness for both of you. If you’re going to go to the trouble of finding a person you want to mentor and putting quality time into it, you really want to make sure it brings value to both parties. Here are...Career Issues EmployersCareer Issues EmployersHow to Create a Work Environment for All Generationsby Lindsey Pollak - June 21, 2019For the first time in American history, there are five unique generations in our workforce: the Traditionalists, Baby Boomers, Generation Xers, Millennials and the newly graduating Generation Zs. At some organizations, colleagues up to 50 years apart in age and work experience are working side by side. There are many areas in which the generations differ in their expectations and preferences in the workplace—comfor...EmployersEmployersThe Need for Authentic Leadershipby Dr. Maynard Brusman - June 20, 2019Companies can no longer be impersonal buildings where employees show up each day, carry out their duties and shut off their brains before going home each night. People aren’t satisfied with simply following procedures and checking boxes. They seek professional fulfillment through engagement, passion and long-term value. The most successful leaders know that employees want a rewarding work life—an environment...Career Issues EmployersCareer Issues EmployersHow Leaders Can Master Agility in a Chaotic Business Worldby Alexandra Levit - June 13, 2019In today’s rapidly changing business world, an agile business is a successful business. But how do you know when the best thing for the project is to change the plan, and how can you execute and communicate changes without destroying team motivation and momentum? The following three strategies may prove helpful. Agility Strategy #1: Create and Challenge Assumptions Any major strategic initiative should involve t...Career Issues EmployersCareer Issues EmployersHow to Invite Collaboration Without Inviting People to Live in Airpods On a Cubicle Farmby Steve Farber - June 4, 2019When you’re the person who makes the seating chart, you have a lot of power and also a serious responsibility to optimize a functioning workplace. There’s a whole Myers-Briggs personality chart of different needs to consider when deciding who sits where and in what kind of working environment.

I’m a strong believer that you can’t be too positive or too empathetic in the business world. Yes, a lot of places of business are far from that ideal, but that’s exactly why you should distinguish yourself from the dog-eat-dog norm and try to make your work life a place of caring and sensitivity.

At the same time, employers want to know what they need to do to recruit and retain top talent. Frankly, both employers and candidates need to up their game. They need to respect each other’s time and act with professionalism. What does this mean?

Plus, most modern companies have some chain of command set up to “listen” to workers, ranging from employee help lines, surveys and check-in meetings all the way up to extensive HR structures. But that’s not the kind of listening I’m talking about.

This information has led to some tremendous breakthroughs with the potential to improve thousands of lives. As leaders, we also have mountains of data available to us—honestly, more than we can assimilate or make sense of. Yet huge decisions are made every day based solely on the numbers. Now, don’t get me wrong. I love numbers!
