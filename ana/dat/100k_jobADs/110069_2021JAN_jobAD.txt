I then check on workmanship. Quality and safety is our number one priority. I check the development to make sure it’s 'on programme’ on a daily basis.How did you get started?From a very early age I was building stuff with Lego and that hobby stayed with me. Later I was making small woodwork projects. I followed an academic route into construction. After completing my A-levels I went to university, where I studied Construction Management. I then went to Sheffield Construction as a graduate trainee. I spent three years working in different departments, including quantity surveying and the design team, giving me a basic feel for the various fields of working in construction.What do you like about your job?What I like most is that it’s outdoors. I’ve always been an outdoors sort of person and I don’t really see myself stuck in an office environment. It’s nice to face a challenge every day, overcome problems and at the end of all the hard graft produce a nice installation that the clients are happy with.What skills do you need?Construction management jobs involve having to manage several things at the same time. So you’ve got to juggle a lot of balls and you really have to be an effective people manager. You have to look after safety and quality and there are a number of elements to the job, all of which need equal attention and successful management.What makes you proud?That great feeling of finishing a building with a satisfied client and walking away. You could be the best accountant in the world but no-one sees your books, whereas what we do is tangible. Everyone gets to see it, including your friends and your family. Everyone can see the building you’ve finished as part of your team. I think that’s a really nice feeling.Where is your career heading?I see myself progressing through to the contracts manager role where you oversee a number of sites, reporting straight to the directors of construction companies. I’d certainly like to become the regional director at ISG.What do you say about joining the construction industry?To any construction new starters I’d say that it’s a wonderful challenge. You’ll meet some great people. You’ll face times where you’re ‘up against it’ but you’ll soon get through that once you finish the building and walk away from it. It’s a great feeling. You’ll open a lot of doors, you’ll meet a lot of fantastic people and you’ll develop a lot of skills.Find out more about the range of construction jobs on offer with our Careers ExplorerProgression OpportunitiesExplore the progression opportunities belowCurrent role Site manager Leasing with clients & staff, you'll take charge of managing & running the workf...Read moreMore information - Site managerCurrent role Contracts manager During a construction project, the contracts manager overseas the contracts proc...Read moreMore information - Contracts managerGET CONNECTEDTwitter Facebook Instagram YouTubeAbout Go ConstructContact usConstruction ambassadorsSkillBuildSite mapTerms of useAccessibilityPrivacy policyGo Construct provides resources for anyone looking for a career in the construction and built environment sector.
