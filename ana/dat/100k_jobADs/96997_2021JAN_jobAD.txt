Management must rethink this approach and consider alternatives.“The pandemic has impacted every aspect of society and many people are still depending on the Covid pandemic unemployment payment as their only source of income.“We will continue to feel the effects of this pandemic, both socially and economically, for months to come. Because of this, it is too early for a State-backed bank to be pushing this reduction in staff numbers.“Workers must not be pressured into taking a redundancy package in the midst of a pandemic just because the bank’s hierarchy are impatient to forge ahead with this plan.“While there may have been a significant jump in the use of online banking and usage of the bank’s mobile app in recent months, there will be still be a considerable number of people who would prefer face-to-face transactions.“Just because the majority of customers may be capable of completing online transactions, it doesn’t mean that those who aren’t as tech savvy should be abandoned.“Meanwhile, I would also like to welcome the European Banking Authorities decision to reactivate its guidelines on payment moratoria. The new end date for these guidelines is March 31st, 2021, having ended previously in September,” he concluded.Michael Fitzmaurice – 0861914565Tagged with → AIBShare →Tweet	Latest NewsFitzmaurice welcomes legislation for de-designation of Natural Heritage AreasGovernment Abandons Small Farmers On Stamp Duty IssueGovernment Short Sighted On Stamp Duty AmendmentsTaoiseach Should Apppoint Josephine Fehily to Top Justice Job ImmediatelyTractor Testing Law To Be AnulledPress ReleasesFitzmaurice meets minister to clarify turf cutting concernsReal danger of energy shortages, with over emphasis on wind energy – FitzmauriceHorticulture sector facing crisis as a result of peat supply issues – FitzmauriceVulnerable people in the community need Covid vaccine clarity – FitzmauriceGovernment needs to provide clear roadmap for businesses in Covid disarray – FitzmauriceMichael Fitzmaurice Independent TDPagesTourism & The EnvironmentHomeCommunity WorkBusiness & EmploymentMy CampaignHealth & EducationMichael on AgricultureWorking with TCCAMy VisionAbout MichaelLatest NewsContact MichaelThe LatestFitzmaurice meets minister to clarify turf cutting concernsIndependent TD Michael Fitzmaurice met with the Minister for Environment, Climate and […]More© 2014 Michael Fitzmaurice Independent"
