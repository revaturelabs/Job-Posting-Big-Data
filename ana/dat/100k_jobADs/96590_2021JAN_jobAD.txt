Apparently Son met with Steve Jobs two years before Apple launched the infamous handset to discuss…smartphones.Son told Rose that he arranged a meeting with Jobs solely to show him a crude sketch of an iPod with mobile capabilities. Obviously, since the iPhone project was already well underway, Jobs didn’t need the drawing, but the meeting still spawned a relationship between the two…Bloomberg has some of Masayoshi’s comments from the interview (via AppleInsider):“I brought my little drawing of an iPod with mobile capabilities. I gave him my drawing, and Steve says, ‘Masa, don’t give me your drawing. I have my own,'” Son recalled during the “Charlie Rose” interview. “I said, ‘Well, I don’t need to give you my dirty paper, but once you have your own product, give me for Japan.’ And he said, ‘Masa, you are crazy.'”Interestingly enough, at the time, Masayoshi Son didn’t control a wireless carrier. In fact, he had little credibility in the mobile world other than the fact that he was a young entrepreneur who had made millions off of selling his own tech companies and making savvy investments in others.“According to Son, Jobs said, “We have not talked to anybody, but you came to see me as the first guy. I’ll give it to you.” The negotiation continued, as Son asked that Jobs put in writing that Apple would give him exclusivity for the Japanese market. Jobs’s reply? “‘No! Masa, I’m not going to sign for you because you don’t even own a mobile carrier yet!’ And I said, ‘Well, look, Steve, you promised me. You gave me your word. I bring a carrier for Japan.'”And he did. SoftBank bought Vodafone Group’s Japanese unit in 2006 for some $15 billion, and the carrier inked a deal with Apple in 2008 to carry the iPhone. The company is still ranked the #3 wireless provider in Japan, but it prospered for years as an exclusive iPhone partner.As for Masayoshi Son, he’s currently listed as the chief executive officer of SoftBank, the chief executive officer of SoftBank Mobile, and as of recently, the chairman of Sprint—the third largest carrier in the US. And Forbes estimates his current net worth to be in upwards of $10 billion.Tagged:Charlie RoseInterviewiPhoneJapanSoftbankSteve JobsMORE FROM iDBJapan is forcing carriers to end smartphone bundling in a move that could hurt AppleJapan’s SoftBank is buying iPhone CPU supplier ARM for a reported $32 billionTim Cook talks Steve Jobs, Beats buyout and more in Charlie Rose interviewNewsletterGet updates directly into your inbox.SubscribeFeaturedLatestMicrosoft begins testing an Apple silicon version of the Edge browserIt’s once again possible to side-load unsupported iOS apps on M1 MacsApple Podcasts now highlights rising podcast creators every monthLet’s Talk iOS 379: The last Mac standingGoogle Maps begins rolling out way more detailed street-level information in select citiesJP Richards is the new Head of Film Marketing Strategy at Apple TV+Microsoft begins testing an Apple silicon version of the Edge browserAirPods Max teardown shows off the premium build inside and outIt’s once again possible to side-load unsupported iOS apps on M1 MacsApple TV+ comedy series ‘Ted Lasso’ picks up a trio of Critics Choice Awards nominationsJailbreak NewsEmerald: A new Status Bar experience that Apple needs to take notes onWidgetCustoms offers jailbroken iOS 14 users a way to personalize their widgetsJailbreak tweaks of the week: DnDSwitch, LottieNotifications, SmartVolumeMixer2, & more…CCUptime lets jailbreakers view their handset’s current jailbreak uptime with easeDnDSwitch lets jailbreakers toggle Do Not Disturb via the ringer/silent switchAppsIt’s once again possible to side-load unsupported iOS apps on M1 MacsGoogle Maps begins rolling out way more detailed street-level information in select citiesApple Maps brings VolunteerMatch integration in time for Martin Luther King Jr. DayPriceBot, TV Remote, Onrise, and other apps to check out this weekendApple is now blocking M1 Mac users from sideloading iPhone and iPad appsAccessoriesGet this highly rated smart plug for just $10The best wallet cases for iPhone 12 (all models)This popular wireless charging pad is down to $9Belkin recalls the Portable Wireless Charger and Stand over fire hazardThe best eco-friendly cases for the iPhone 12 lineupPodcastApple Podcasts now highlights rising podcast creators every monthLet’s Talk iOS 379: The last Mac standingLet’s Talk iOS 378: Alive and wellChanges are coming to the Let’s Talk iOS podcast and we want to hear from youTwitter snaps up Breaker, a podcast app focused on social interactionDealsMagSafe Charger Silicone Cover for $11 Waterproof Glove & Ice Scraper Set for $17 Portable Heated Ice Scraper for $23Download the iDB appAbout | Contact | Disclosure | Privacy | Unsubscribe2021 © iDownloadBlog.com - This website is not affiliated with Apple.HomeAppsTutorialsJailbreak NewsJailbreak TweaksDownloadsWallpapersAccessoriesDealsPodcastsWrite for iDBContact Us"
