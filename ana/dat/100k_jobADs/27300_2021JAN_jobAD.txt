A big thing us teenagers without cars struggle with is transportation. when getting a job you should probably make sure you have good grades so that you know that your job that you could get wouldnt affect your grades.I first applied online for Taco Bell. It was a really long process and I needed my social security card number and it also asked me a lot about my reading comprehension, days I can work and also when I can start. You might need to know these things before applying.After a few days of waiting after submitting your application you should probably call the place you applied to and nicely ask them to talk to a manager or hiring manager. Tell them that you submitted an application and you were wondering if they had looked at it,In my case they asked me to come in for a interview and if not maybe call again the next day.What I have learned is you may feel like you’re being annoying but they will like it and they will understand you are very eager for work. After calling Taco Bell twice they asked me to come in for an interview.A few days later I came in and talked to this really nice lady who asked me a few questions about working on weekends and why I want to work there and what I see myself doing in a few years after high school and also about previous work experience. At the end of the interview she gave me the job and asked me my size in shirts and gave me a start date.Ever since then I have been working at Taco Bell and I enjoy it so much.PollsSorry, there are no polls available at the moment.Polls ArchiveNavigate LeftOpinion2021, A Perfect Time For ChangeFeatureNagy Outlines Strategies and Meaning of ‘Taking Care of Yourself’FeatureSchool Should Open for Workouts Opinion PieceOpinionQuads Complicate AP Classes; Still Best OptionOpinionThe Summer of ‘20 During COVID-19OpinionCovid Forces Everyone to Learn a Balancing ActOpinionMOS: Opinions On The Black Lives Matter ProtestsOpinionMeasure 26-208: Vote Yes!FeatureDistance Learning: The Pros & ConsOpinionPersonal Perspective: Surviving QuarantineNavigate RightThe Centennial TalonYouTubeInstagramTwitterFacebookThe student news site of Centennial High SchoolSubmit SearchSearchThe Centennial Talon • © 2021 • FLEX WordPress Theme by SNO • Log inCloseClose Modal WindowSearchSubmit SearchActivate SearchShare on FacebookShare via EmailPrintScroll to TopTaco Bell Gives Student First Job OpportunitySearchHomeAboutStaffNewsSportsFeatureOpinionSubmit a Letter"
