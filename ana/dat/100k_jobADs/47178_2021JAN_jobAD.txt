Gretchen Whitmer on Monday. She signed two new executive orders in response to COVID-19, a disease caused by a new coronavirus. One will temporarily expand eligibility for unemployment benefits due to the appearance of COVID-19. The other order temporarily closes a multitude of public places and limits restaurants to carry-out and delivery orders in response to COVID-19.There are now 53 positive cases in Michigan of COVID-19, a disease caused by a new coronavirus, as of this story’s publication, although health officials believe that number is much higher.Graphic by Laina G. StebbinsCOVID-19 and unemploymentExecutive Order 2020-10 aims to temporarily expand eligibility for unemployment benefits due to the appearance of COVID-19.Under the new order, state unemployment benefits would be extended to the following:People who have childcare responsibilities due to school closures or are forced to care for loved ones who become ill.People who are sick, quarantined, or immunocompromised and don’t have access to paid family and medical leave or are laid off.First responders or those who work in health care and become ill or are quarantined due to exposure to COVID-19.Coronavirus cases climb to 45, casinos closingAccording to the news release, access to benefits for unemployed workers will also be extended. Unemployed individuals’ benefits will be increased from 20 weeks to 26 weeks. The application eligibility period will be increased from 14 to 28 days and normal in-person registration and work search requirements will be suspended.The state also is seeking solutions for self-employed workers and independent contractors who traditionally do not have access to unemployment insurance.A statewide coronavirus hotline will be open 7 days a week from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 1-888-535-6136. Information can be found on the DHHS website or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention website.“While we work together to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, we must do everything we can to help working families,” said Whitmer. “This executive order will provide immediate relief to those who can’t go to work, and who rely on their paycheck to put food on the table for themselves and their families.”Whitmer also is looking into ways to help small businesses impacted by COVID-19. According to a news release, she’s working with the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) in order to get an Economic Injury Disaster Loan Declaration for Michigan. Her office said the process has already started and once it’s granted, small businesses in qualifying areas will be able to access low-interest loans through the SBA.Earlier this month, Congress passed legislation that makes $1 billion available to the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide low-interest loans to small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, and nonprofits that have suffered substantial economic losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.Breaking: Whitmer shutting down bar, restaurant dine-in service at 3 p.m. MondayRestaurants, bars, gyms shut downAs the Michigan Advance reported Monday morning, Whitmer is taking action to shut down businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
