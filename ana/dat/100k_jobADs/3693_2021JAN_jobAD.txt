The 1,800 acre community will be called Springwood Village–offering 2,500 single family homes, apartments, office space, hotels and shopping centers.Posted In: Local NewsRelated articlesApartment construction is booming in these two Houston suburbsread moreNearly 10,000 homes sold in Houston in Decemberread moreHouston housing market set new records in 2020, says HARread moreCommenting is not available unless JavaScript is enabled.Join the conversation Cancel replyCancel replySave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.Meet Who’s Who in Houston Real EstateMercedes MosbyMost PopularLocal NewsTop 10 Who’s Who profiles for 2020Local NewsTop 10 Agent Snapshots of 2020Awards7 Houston-area master-planned communities make top 50 list as sales thrive during pandemicLocal NewsPredictions: Houston real estate leaders talk 2021Agents' Choice2020 Agents’ Choice Award WinnersRESOURCE GUIDEBusiness DevelopmentBecome a top producer with a business plan that works for youTechnologyHow to grow your real estate brand with CRMsBest PracticesLearn and get certified on the fundamentals of real estateAssistantsTrain and certify your assistant for successAdvertising TermsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy PolicyComment PolicyContact UsPress RoomCopyright © 2021 Houston Agent Magazine.
