Gives you warm, fuzzy feelings about the space program, doesn't it?The only problem? The video isn't actually from NASA. It was created by YouTube user damewse, who expressed frustration with the space exploration agency's lack of media savvy, especially when it comes to things like social networking.According to the video's description:NASA is the most fascinating, adventurous, epic institution ever devised by human beings, and their media sucks. Seriously. None of their brilliant scientists appear to know how to connect with the social media crowd, which is now more important than ever. In fact, NASA is an institution whose funding directly depends on how the public views them.In all of their brilliance, NASA seems to have forgotten to share their hopes and dreams in a way the public can relate to, leaving one of humanities grandest projects with terrible PR and massive funding cuts. I have a lot of ideas for a NASA marketing campaign, but I doubt they'd pay me even minimum wage to work for them. I literally have an MSWord document entitled NASAideas.doc full of ideas waiting to share.As ranty as it seems, damewse does have a point. If touchy-feely ads can work for companies like BP, maybe NASA can be saved from the grave too. Someone give this YouTube user a job!Follow Houston Press on Facebook and on Twitter @HairBallsNews or @HoustonPressKeep the Houston Press Free...
