The uncertain term employment contract will be as part of the EOSC-Life Research and Innovation Action (RIA) “Providing an open collaborative space for digital biology in Europe” (INFRAEOSC-04-2018), Grant Agreement number: 824087.EOSC-Life / EMBRC-ERIC Demonstrator Project Description:Marine Eukaryote Genomics Portal – access to tools and data-flows for marine genome annotation in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC-Life).A new platform will address the fragmented research landscape for genome annotation of marine organisms. The project will develop a portal to marine genomic resources and a community driven annotation platform for marine eukaryotes which would provide a focus for post-assembly genomic workflows and data access and complement access services such as EMBRIC Configurator, ELIXIR ontologies, and meta-data standards. Together these resources will expose the workflow from genome data collection to publication using open access and FAIR compliant standards and procedures. Although taxon agnostic, initially the platform will focus on pelagic fishes and the use primarily of comparative methods of gene prediction and validation.Job Summary and Duties:The Researcher will provide bioinformatic and computational expertise to develop a “Demonstrator” project for the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC-Life) infrastructure.1) Develop a web-based portal for the EOSC-Life to enable access to marine genomic resources, including a inter-species software pipeline to compare and update gene annotations and ontologies.a) Develop programmatically a web-based application module for the Orcae platform (Online Resource for Community Annotation of Eukaryotes).b) Develop programmatically databases and software pipelines for genome curation, and annotation, and ontology comparisons.2) Provide general bioinformatic expertise to project managers.Relevant Legislation:1. Portuguese Labour Law, approved by Law nr 7/2009, from 12th February in its current form.2. Portuguese Administrative Procedure CodeStarting Date: The contract will begin in September 2019 and will be in place until the work plan is completed.Place Of Work: Centro de Ciências do Mar (CCMAR), Campus de Gambelas, Universidade do Algarve, Faro, Portugal.Working Schedule: 35 hours per week.Monthly Remuneration: Gross monthly Remuneration is dependent on qualifications to a highest position of 2.128,34€, correspondent to the level 33 of the TRU.Application Period: Applications will be accepted between 11th July and 16th August 2019.Required Profile:1.

Demonstrable skills in the administration of UNIX(-like) systems, proficiency in Python programming, relational databases and SQL, and related web technologies.3. A high proficient in English (spoken and written).Non-compliance with any of these requirements invalidates the application. Provision of false documentation will be punished by law.Desired profile:1. A PhD in Computer Sciences, Biology, Computational Biology, or related discipline with less than five years postdoc.2. Experience of analysing large life science data sets, such as genomic data and/or physical measurement data, using bioinformatics tools and web-based resources.3. Proficiency in the use of the Python Django web framework.Selection Panel: the selection panel is composed of Adelino Canário, Professor at Algarve University and CCMAR’s President (President), Cymon J. Cox, researcher at CCMAR (Member); and Gianluca De Moro, researcher at CCMAR (Member).Candidate Evaluation: The evaluation is carried out in two phases, which will result in a final classification between 0 and 100 points.Phase 1) Curricular assessmentThe selection is made through the evaluation of the motivation letter, which will include the activity and career development plan, and of the scientific and professional curriculum focusing on the relevance, quality and timeliness of the criteria referred below and of the motivation letter in the subject area, considering the specific requirements and the adequacy for the duties to be performed:CA) Scientific and/or technological production in the last five years, deemed most relevant by the candidate;CB) Activities of applied research, or based on practice, that the candidate considers to have had greater impact;CC) Activities of extension and dissemination of knowledge, namely in the promotion of the culture and the scientific practices that the candidate considers more relevant;CD) Project management activities and programmes of science, technology and innovation, or experience in observation, monitoring and evaluation of the scientific and technological system or higher education in Portugal or abroad. Included here are the activities of preparation and submission of applications for science, technology and innovation projects.The period of five years referred in the evaluation criteria may be increased by the selection panel, at the request of the candidate, when justified on grounds of suspension of scientific activity for socially protected reasons, namely for reasons of parental leave, prolonged serious illness, and other situations of unavailability for work legally protected.The candidates who have obtained less than 70 points in the curricular assessment will be considered not approved in absolute merit. The decision to exclude on absolute merit is communicated to the candidates by electronic mail for the purpose of hearing with interested parties.Phase 2) InterviewIf the selection panel considers it necessary for the evaluation, the top five candidates with the highest scores of the curricular assessments that were approved in absolute merit will qualify for the second phase, consisting of an individual interview, either face-to-face or through a videoconference. Interviews will be conducted after the decision on absolute merit. The interview will be weighted, at most, as 20% of the final classification score and will serve the sole purpose of clarifying aspects related to the results of scientific research of the candidates.Selection ProcessEach member of the selection panel will assess all the candidates in all the factors from CA to CD scoring between 0 and 100 and must present the reasons for the scores given. Abstention is not allowed.The curricular assessment (C) of each candidate is obtained from the sums of the scores of each criterion multiplied by the weights according to the formulation, rounded to the decimal place.C = CA*70 + CB*20 + CC*5 + CD*5Candidates approved in absolute merit but that do not qualify for the interview will have 0 points in the second phase.The final scores (FS) of each candidate is obtained according to the average of the final results of the curricular assessment and of the interview (I) that is evaluated by the weights of the following formulation, rounded to the decimal place.FS = C*80 + I*20After determining the final score (FS) of all candidates, each member of the selection panel will rank the candidates according to the final scores assigned to them from the highest to the lowest. This is followed by the vote to the first place and for each successive place. A candidate is selected when they receive the majority of votes. If this does not happen in the first round of voting, the least ranked candidate is eliminated, and the procedure is repeated with the remaining candidates.
