New products might gradually grow in popularity and build up demand over time – or they might become an overnight sensation and go stratospheric in months. There will be seasonal demands for various products associated with climate, weather, festivals etc. The sales and marketing team will engage in promotions and appear at trade shows, which can lead to spikes in sales.While increased sales is undoubtedly a good thing, if they are not keeping up with demand it’s a missed opportunity for the business. The vendor scheduler will be employed to keep every party in a manufacturing process informed of their expected workflows and demands as they rise and fall in response to the various stimuli. One of the most important contacts will be with the suppliers of components and raw materials, as it is ultimately they who will be the facilitators of increased productivity. Should they look like struggling with meeting demand, alternative or additional sources will need to be sought.The only way to get the entire picture of a supply and demand process is to keep in touch with all departments, as well as external agents such as customers and suppliers. By analysing trends, forecasts and business knowledge, the vendor scheduler can help keep the production line running like clockwork and considerably minimise storage costs and waste.The skills requiredCommunication is the key to vendor scheduling. There will be lots of it, with the shop floor, sales and marketing, suppliers, customers and senior management, on a daily basis. Excellent written, graphical and spoken communication will make sure mistakes are minimised and the process runs smoothly.Analysing results from the sales and marketing teams, as well as orders completed and forecast demand, will be important too. The vendor scheduler will be able to make sense of data and understand how it relates to the business at hand, so a methodical, analytical and logical mindset will stand applicants in good stead for this role.You will also need to be familiar and competent with planning solutions and general office applications such as spreadsheets, databases and word processors.Cast UK’s supply chain opportunitiesApplicants approach Cast UK for a number of reasons, whether seeking more job fulfilment or simply relocating with the family, so it’s good to know that we always have the complete range of positions available nationwide.We are a growing force in logistics, procurement and supply chain recruitment, partly because these are the only sectors we deal with.
