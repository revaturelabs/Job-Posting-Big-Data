TO ALL ARTICLESIt’s a big bounce back, undeniably, but we’re not out of the woods yet.The 3.3 per cent boost to Australia’s economic growth from July to September is stronger than most anticipated, but keep in mind the base it’s coming off: a 7 per cent fall in the prior three months, as COVID-19 health restrictions shut down large tracts of the economy, the biggest quarterly slump ever recorded by the ABS.Over the year, the economy shrank by a whopping 3.8 per cent.That’s 2.5 times the previous recession, in the early 1990s, when it only contracted by 1.4 per cent.Yet back then, it took a decade for unemployment to return to the levels it was before the downturn.After falling off a cliff, it’s going to take a while before the economy gets back to where it was before — and it will never scale the heights it would have climbed had the recession not intervened.It will be years before the unemployment rate falls to the levels before the crisis.There is good news, though.Over the three months to September, those of us who could were out eating, drinking, travelling and being merry.After being smashed by lockdown, accommodation and hospitality recorded a 41 per cent increase in activity in the September quarter, despite Victorians, hunkered down by stage four restrictions, not being able to join the party.The bad news was that business investment remained weak, falling by 3 per cent over the latest quarter.Exports shrank, down 3.2 percent as demand for Australian minerals weakened.The sanctions and tariffs imposed on Australian exporters by an angry China won’t help to end that malaise.Neither will the failure of much of the world to beat the virus as Europe and the Unite States face alarming increases in COVID-19 case numbers, which may worsen in the northern winter.Wages continued to fall, too, with unit labour costs down 0.7 per cent in the quarter and 9 per cent in the year.And that’s where the recession hits home.Headlines might read recovery underway, but the lived experience for many people is lower wages, unemployment, and not enough work — and that will continue for some time.On the latest numbers, 7 per cent of Australians are unemployed — not counting the 1.5 million still on the Government’s JobKeeper wages subsidy — and nearly 11 per cent are unable to get enough hours of work (underemployed), down a little off the peak during the recession but still very high.When people don’t have jobs, they don’t spend as much and they can struggle to meet their debts.The banks have shown forbearance but as it ends, we will see a wave of defaults from people and businesses unable to service their loans.The Morrison Government is pinning a lot of hope on a pick-up in business investment and employment to drive the recovery.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s delayed Federal budget contained surprisingly little in direct spending measures to stimulate the economy, relying instead on incentives to encourage businesses to invest, and subsidies to encourage the hiring of unemployed workers aged 20 to 35.The trouble is that many businesses won’t invest or hire unless and until they’re confident the demand will be there; that’s been shown by the very low take-up of cheap loans for small and medium sized enterprises, subsidised by the Reserve Bank, that have been on offer from banks since the start of the downturn.Households haven’t been overly keen to splash their cash either: the savings rate, though down slightly, remains extraordinarily high.And we’re about to lose some of the props that have helped bolster the economy; JobKeeper, which is still paying the wages of 1.5 million Australians, scales back further in January and ends altogether before the close of March, which will hit demand and push up the jobless rate.Consumption will also be hit by a reduction in the JobSeeker payment rate for the unemployed.The risk is that the withdrawal of these measures will slow the recovery, despite the positive signs.On the other hand, if vaccines become available sooner than expected, opening up travel and boosting the global economy, we could see a stronger and swifter recovery than just about anyone imagined during the pandemic’s darkest days.By Stephen Long (Original ABC Article)BACK TO ALL ARTICLESYou might feel overwhelmed, but you have options and there are steps you can take yourself.
