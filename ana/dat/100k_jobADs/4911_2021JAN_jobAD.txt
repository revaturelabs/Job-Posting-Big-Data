Whether it’s meeting and making new friends everyday, the friendly banter and chit chat that comes with it, or if it’s the ever evolving cuts and styles that you’re mastering constantly.In the year 2000 I was introduced to the industry and started my apprenticeship at the early age of 16. I was instantly hooked. With over 16 years experience this job has taken me to places I would have never dreamed.I was taught by a man that I still respect and adore to this day. He guided me to open several of my own shops, across different states in Australia, and also to work in different countries.People always ask me: What’s your number one approach to having a good vibe in a Barber Shop? For me its simple, make it feel like you’re customers are having a hair cut round at my house.Come in to Hammerheads, check it out and kick back.
