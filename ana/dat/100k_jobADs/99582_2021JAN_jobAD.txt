Will he actually be useful for Villa, considering the options we already have in the squad in the positions he covers? Considering he may not be a regular, is it better for Villa to blood our own academy players? Can he really do a better job than Elphick in covering any injuries to either James Chester or John Terry?Meanwhile, Grabban was a more straight-up loan-signing, as he’s essentially the cover for Jonathan Kodjia, that the club were always going to seek to get.These two incoming players are discussed along with the outgoings – most notably, Tommy Elphick – in episode 39 of the My Old Man Said podcast.If you haven’t caught up with the episode yet, do so before you listen to episode 40 (which has just come out), the show also includes discussion of Villa Park becoming an asset of community value, coverage of Villa’s last away game and balks at Mesut Ozil’s £350,000-a-week wagesListen the Discussion of Villa’s January Window:﻿Episode 39 NotesAston Villa’s 100% record in 2018 so far, takes Aston Villa to five wins on the trot, as they complete their final transfer business for the promotion push ahead.

I also believe that we should be playing our academy players but obviously we have to pick the time and place, but I think Green and O’ Hare should be more involved.Now for a moan I cant believe we are thinking bout playing Agbonlahor in our most important game of the season, how long since he played in a match ? Forget him and throw Grabbon in even if it’s as a sub, although I would like to see him start up front with Hogan.Comments are closed.Aston Villa News 24/7SALE NOW ON!Follow us on Instagram @myoldmansaidMy Old Man Said (MOMS) is an award-winning football blog & podcast.
