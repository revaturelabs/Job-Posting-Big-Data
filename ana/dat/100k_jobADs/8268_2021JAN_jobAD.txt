Cori Bush tears into Republicans for evading metal detectors to enter House chamberJake Johnson, Common DreamsJanuary 13, 2021Rep. Cori Bush (Screengrab)Democratic Congresswoman Cori Bush late Tuesday suggested that some of her House Republican colleagues find a different line of work after several GOP lawmakers refused to walk through metal detectors established as a precautionary measure in the wake of the deadly invasion of the U.S. Capitol last week by a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters.\"If they won't abide by the simple things that this job calls for, then go find another one.\"—Rep. Cori Bush\"First of all, we're talking about your job. Let's just look at it from the most basic level: If you work at McDonald's, you have to wear the uniform or you're not working today,\" the Missouri Democrat said in an appearance on MSNBC. \"I don't know, have they ever had a job before?\"\"To say that this is against your rights: do you rush through and not go through the metal detectors when you're trying to get on a plane? Like, that's a bunch of bullcrap,\" said Bush, the lead sponsor of a resolution that aims to expel the GOP lawmakers who incited the attack on the Capitol. \"That is them trying to push the limits as far as they can. We have congressmembers who have said that they want to carry their guns on the floor, on the House floor... This is where we should feel safe, but you're bringing your guns to the office building. I don't feel safe around that. Many people don't feel safe with that.\"In a tweet late Tuesday echoing the message of her interview, Bush wrote that \"if you work at McDonald's and you don't wear the uniform, you don't work that day.\"\"If you won't abide by the rules of this job,\" Bush added, \"go find another one.\"Watch Bush's MSNBC appearance:Bush's remarks came after Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert (Colo.), Louie Gohmert (Texas), Steve Stivers (Ohio), Larry Bucshon (Ind.), Van Taylor (Texas), and others on Tuesday complained about or evaded metal detectors put in place following last week's deadly attack on the Capitol Building.\"Boebert, a newly elected member who vowed in a viral video to carry a gun in the Capitol, was seen in an apparent dispute with police over going through the metal detector,\" NBC News reported. \"Taylor refused to pass through the metal detector and argued with officers about it.\"The metal detectors were installed outside of the House chamber after Democratic lawmakers raised the need for Capitol Police to take precautions against \"all these members who were in league with the insurrectionists who love to carry their guns,\" as one unnamed Democrat told HuffPost earlier this week.\"Regular Americans have to go through a metal detector when they enter an airport. They don't scream and whine at police officers or have to be restrained,\" Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) tweeted Tuesday. \"Children across the country have to do this to get into school and they handle it more maturely than members of Congress.\"`); propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display(\"rawstory_mobile_1\"); }); } if ( postContent[2] ) { postContent[2].insertAdjacentHTML('afterend',`Tired of ads?

Today. Now,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RBReich/status/1352657553826607109\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> former secretary of labor Robert Reich in a tweet directed at Schumer. \"Hell, even David Brooks agrees.\" </p><p> As columnist Ryan Cooper <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/962414/mcconnell-already-moving-strangle-biden-presidency\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> for <em>The Week</em> on Thursday: \"[McConnell] is demanding Democrats preserve his ability to block anything they propose with the Senate filibuster, so he can ruin the country and blame it on them, and he is gambling that moderate Democratic senators will be too scared to call his bluff. Democrats should tell McConnell to go pound sand, and nuke the filibuster right now.\" </p><p> Cooper explained: </p><blockquote> Recall that the filibuster allows just 41 senators to block most legislation. Activists have begged Democrats to get rid of the filibuster after witnessing McConnell use it to shamelessly obstruct Democratic priorities and then immediately remove it as an obstacle to his own chief priority, confirming right-wing Supreme Court Justices. Yet so far a crucial segment of moderate Democratic senators have resisted, for reasons of \"tradition,\" or worries it will force them to take difficult votes, or simple timidity. Now McConnell has broken yet another Senate norm by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/21/democrats-mcconnell-filibuster-460967\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">threatening to filibuster</a> the Organizing Resolution unless Democrats agree to keep the legislative filibuster for the next two years. To the best of my knowledge, filibustering the initial organizational rule package in a new Congress has never happened before. (Incidentally, since the Senate will continue to operate under its current rules, that leaves Republicans in charge of the committees so long as it is not passed.)<br/> If Democrats agree, given McConnell's history, he is virtually guaranteed to not allow any normal legislation through, and to drag out the confirmation of any appointee as long as possible. The only way to pass any law will be through the cumbersome and limited reconciliation process. Just as he did under President [Barack] Obama, McConnell wants to throw sand in the gears of government, prevent Biden from accomplishing anything, blame Democrats for the resulting dysfunction, and take back full control of the Senate in two years.</blockquote><p> In response to McConnell's request to keep the filibuster in place, Schumer on the Senate floor Friday morning said the proposal \"is unacceptable, and it won't be accepted. And the Republican leader knew that when he first proposed it.\" </p><p> In a statement on Thursday, Mairead Lynn, a spokesperson for the watchdog group Accountable.US, also suggested that Schumer should not tolerate McConnell's obstruction for one minute longer and called out the Republican leader's objections to the organizing agreement in the Senate thus far as clearly made in bad faith. </p><p> \"If McConnell wanted to work with Democrats in good faith,\" said Lynn, \"he would have spent the last two months moving President Biden's Cabinet nominees through the confirmation process—a precedent afforded to every previous president.\" </p><p> McConnell's \"unprecedented\" and \"outsized\" demands that would neutralize Democratic control over the Senate, added Lynn, \"are nothing more than a last-ditch effort to further obstruct the Biden administration from implementing the will of the people. Enough is enough: McConnell needs to drop his unreasonable demands and let the Senate get to work.\" </p><p> On Thursday, Ezra Klein, Brooks' liberal colleague at the <em>Times</em>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/opinion/biden-inauguration-democrats.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">argued</a> that none of the far-reaching bills that Democrats have vowed to pass will be possible in \"a Senate in which the filibuster forces 60-vote supermajorities on routine legislation.\" </p><p> Democrats, wrote Klein, \"have plenty of ideas that could improve people's lives and strengthen democracy. But they have, repeatedly, proved themselves more committed to preserving the status quo of the political system than fulfilling their promises to voters. They have preferred the false peace of decorum to the true progress of democracy. If they choose that path again, they will lose their majority in 2022, and they will deserve it.\" </p><p> According to Klein, Biden's \"agenda will live or die in the Senate\"—and if proper action is not taken, he continued, \"odds are it will die, killed by the filibuster.\" </p><p> This is exactly why progressive critics have urged Democrats to immediately end the charade orchestrated by McConnell. </p><p> In a series of tweets Thursday, Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive advocacy group Indivisible, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ezralevin/status/1352328111162093568\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> his read on the situation was this: \"McConnell wants to block popular bills this Congress—stuff like D.C. statehood and H.R. 1. He doesn't want to have the filibuster fight with that backdrop, so instead he's picking the fight on a boring-sounding procedure thing hoping it's more favorable ground for him.\" </p><p> \"To be clear,\" he added: \"Senate Dems have no reason or need to give into McConnell's BS. It would be a colossal mistake of historic proportions for them to give in. And I don't think they will here.\" </p><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script><div class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"display: flex; max-width: 550px; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"\" data-tweet-id=\"1352344411590561797\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"twitter-widget-1\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/embed/index.html?dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-1&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1352344411590561797&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rawstory.com%2Fr%2Fentryeditor%2F2650071971%23publish&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=ed20a2b%3A1601588405575&amp;width=550px\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; width: 550px; height: 456px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe></div><p>And as Levin put it on Friday in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ezralevin/status/1352655220266905606\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tweet</a> linking to Brooks' column: \"Killing the Jim Crow filibuster is the institutionalist, pro-democracy position.\"</p> <script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>CONTINUE READING Show lessTrendingLatestVideos'So petty': Donald and Melania Trump fired chief usher before leaving White House to spite BidensGOP ‘moron’ Lauren Boebert urged to ‘stop eating paint’ after ‘clueless’ tweet about Paris Climate Agreement‘Pathetic’ NYT reporter blasted for ‘ragingly incompetent’ questioning of Biden press secretaryTrump-loving store owner pulled a gun on customer who refused to take off his face mask: policeK-Pop fans ruin GOP's attempt to push #ImpeachBidenNowQAnon congresswoman hasn't filed Biden impeachment articles because 'she thought it would be easier': reportTrump campaign paid $2.7 million to groups that organized rally that preceded Capitol riotsLawyer for 'QAnon Shaman' says he feels 'duped' by Trump after not getting a pardonSecond Miami bank severs ties with Donald Trump -- 4 banks are now shunning him: reportHow Joe Biggs and the Proud Boys turned on the policeNew York state runs out of COVID-19 vaccines: Gov Andrew CuomoOath Keepers lose ‘Community Rewards’ donations from major grocer after Capitol riots: report‘Seditious conspiracy’: Madison Cawthorn and Republicans hit with ethics complaint over Capitol coupQAnon Fed employee was under FBI surveillance -- and stormed the Capitol anyway: reportTrump ‘threw America under the bus’: Pentagon official rips Trump’s cowardly incitement of insurrectionCapitol mob wasn’t just angry white men – there were angry white women as wellTed Cruz whines Dems are 'playing political games' after he is hit with ethics complaint over Capitol riotTrump rioter insists ‘Q was correct’ as her attempt to crowdfund her legal defense goes down in flamesJoe Biden vows to confront domestic violent extremism – orders DNI, FBI, DHS to conduct comprehensive threat assessment'Sad Trump apologist' Elise Stefanik buried in brutal new Lincoln Project adLISTEN: Biden's Treasury nominee honored with Hamilton musical-style songQAnon congresswoman announces ‘I’ve just filed articles of impeachment’ on Joe Biden – over debunked conspiracy theoryDemocrats told to end era in which 'only the bad guys understand they're in a fight'Black man fatally struck and dragged by truck-driving racist in Massachusetts road rage attack: police'Are we on another planet right now?'
