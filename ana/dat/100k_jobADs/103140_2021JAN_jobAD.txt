So, does it matter which one you get a job in?Well, first off, it’s important that you find a job you enjoy doing.

If you work for a construction firm, health and safety will likely be a focus area. If trade unions are active in your chosen industry, a lot of time may be spent on employee relations.Supported byThis describes editorially independent and objective content, written and edited by the GTI content team, with which the organisation would like to be associated and has provided some funding in order to be so.
