Bradley Centre in Chatham on Oct. 23 from 2-7 p.m.“Last year, it was successful enough for our board to say, ‘Let’s do it again,'” said Kristy Jacobs, CKWPB project manager.The event received great reviews last year, she said, adding employers “found it as a very great community-building opportunity,” she said.Jacobs said a lot of smaller employers can’t put together a job fair, due to the cost and time involved, adding employers liked the fact “we can just show up and meet people.”The availability of more than 300 jobs may surprise many.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedJacobs said there isn’t announcements about 500 jobs being available with one employer, adding, “our workforce is pretty fluid, there are always positions open.”Bringing 40 employers together helps attract a lot more people than if only two or three employers are holding a job fair, she said.“The community responded with over 400 jobs seekers coming through and registering last year.”So far, more than 300 people have registered for the job fair through the Eventbrite page: .Jacobs said those registering to attend get “a little insider information” including a weekly email leading up to the event including if new employers come onboard.“For some people, they’ve never attended a job fair before, so we’ve got some information going to them,” she said.This includes how to prepare, places in the community where they can get help updating their resume, and updating their interview skills, she added.You don’t have to be unemployed to attend the job fair, Jacobs said.“It’s not just for people who are not working, it’s for people who are open to expanding their career opportunities.”eshreve@postmedia.com@ChathamnewsShare this article in your social networkShare this Story: More than 300 jobs available at Chatham-Kent eventCopy LinkEmailFacebookTwitterRedditPinterestLinkedInTumblrNews Near West LorneThis Week in FlyersArticle CommentsCommentsPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion and encourage all readers to share their views on our articles.
