It would depend upon the size of the rootball and if it could be removed without too much damage to the roots of the plant. You would need to transplant after it has finshed fruiting. Have the area prepared to where the tree is going to be located. When transplanting the tree, keep the rootball in tact as much as possible. Once it has been transplanted, water in with Yates Dynamic Lifter Liquid Concentrate. It's a organically certified fertiliser, which contains seaweed, blood&bone and fish meal to help developing new roots and restoring healthy growth. Citrus trees are grafted. They do not grow well on their own rootstock as they are prone to root rot. If your tree fails to transplant well, it might be a good idea to buy a replacement kaffir lime and either keep it in a pot or a sunny spot in your garden.Topics: Fruit and Citrus Issues: Garden JobsYATES SHOPPLANTSYATES VIDEOSCONTACT USIdeas & PlansProject guides & articlesGarden CalendarGarden eMagazinesWater Wise GardeningPlantsVegetablesFruit & CitrusIndoor PlantsTrees & ShrubsAll Other PlantsLawnLawn Care TipsCommon ProblemsVarieties of TurfProductsAbout YatesGarden Pest ControlSeedsGarden FertilisersLawnBrandsDynamic LifterRatsakWater SavingThriveBuffalo ProGarden CommunityJoin nowContact YatesIdeas & PlansProject guides & articlesGarden CalendarGarden eMagazinesWater Wise GardeningPlantsVegetablesFruit & CitrusIndoor PlantsTrees & ShrubsAll Other PlantsLawnLawn Care TipsCommon ProblemsVarieties of TurfProductsAbout YatesGarden Pest ControlSeedsGarden FertilisersLawnBrandsDynamic LifterRatsakWater SavingThriveBuffalo ProGarden CommunityJoin nowContact YatesAbout UsCorporateYates New ZealandÂ© 2020 Yates, a division of DuluxGroup (Australia) Pty LtdPrivacy PolicySite termsChat with us, powered by LiveChat"
