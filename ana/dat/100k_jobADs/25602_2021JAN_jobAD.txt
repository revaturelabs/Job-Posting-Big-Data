If you are unhappy with the results from that conversation, you can have the issue determined by filing a grievance under either the administrative or the negotiated grievance procedure applicable to you and your agency. This may or may not result in a change to the position description.Alternatively, you may ask for a desk audit, which may change your position description, and it could re-determine your grade level, which might go up or down. Because your agency is measuring and rating you for the critical duty, a desk audit could well result in a change of your position description.This response is written by James P.
