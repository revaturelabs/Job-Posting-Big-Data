Nevertheless, ERR attempted to urge a thought of what percentage companies have gone out of business and other people lost their job within the sector.There cannot bee too many bankruptcies because the option was taken off the table for the duration of the emergency situation and two months that. the govt also introduced a short lived measure wont to support tourism sector companies to stay them from laying people off and shutting shop.

But also a transport company registered in Tallinn, a restaurant and entertainment establishment in Tartu and a labor rental company in Võru County.The disappearance of Finnish customers could even be behind a Narva instrument manufacturer’s bankruptcy. a minimum of ten companies thus far .
