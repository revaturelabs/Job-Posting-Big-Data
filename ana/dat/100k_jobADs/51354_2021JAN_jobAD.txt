This is an incredibly bad way to shore up their budget. It is both penny wise and pound foolish. Education and training is one of the president’s highest priorities. Apparently the Department of Labor has not gotten that memo.We the staff at the Treasure Island Job Corps (AFT Local 6319) are asking you to join us in telling the Department of Labor to reconsider their decision and to ask our members of Congress to please tell the DOL not to pick apart an excellent educational program.There are 122 Job Corps Centers throughout the U.S. Each center educates and trains hundreds of young adults a year, who find jobs in their trade and then become tax paying – and voting – citizens. Each Job Corps has high school and GED programs, and we have an advanced training program that sends our high school and GED graduates to local community colleges so that they can earn an AA degree.Education and training is one of the president’s highest priorities. Apparently the Department of Labor has not gotten that memo.Each Job Corps Center also has trade training in the construction trades, culinary, security, office administration, certified medical assisting and more. Once the trainees have completed their basic trade, they can go on to an advanced trade.We have counselors that help our trainees through difficult times and issues. We have career transition staff that also helps our trainees through their trades and helps them after they graduate with resume and interview needs.The trainees have resident advisors who work with them on life skills. And of course we have the all-important instructors who teach them either academics or their chosen trade.This appeal first appeared on Facebook.Editor’s note: To protest this bad decision, call Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi at (415) 556-4862. For those who want to join Job Corps, this message appears on their website: “Exceptions will be made for applicants who are homeless, runaways or in the foster care system. If you have questions about whether you qualify in one of these categories, please call (800) 733-5627 to speak with an admissions counselor.”TAGSAFT Local 6319career transition staffCongresswoman Nancy PelosiDepartment of Laborfoster care systemhomelessJob Corps CentersJob Corps GED programJob Corps High School programrunawaystrade trainingTreasure Island Job CorpsMaryRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORBlacks are fighting back against privatization and systemic racist attacks on San Francisco City workersWhat politicians, the Navy and the EPA don’t want you to know: Treasure Island and Hunters Point are equally toxic Superfund sitesPACC member and Justice-4-Pedie-Perez organizer murderedJudge Rebecca Hardie allows Contra Costa CPS social worker to commit perjuryRep.
