She is either giving the president bad advice or she is deliberately misleading the public, whether it's on this issue or the Benghazi video. But this deal smelled from the beginning, Chris. As soon as he was released other members of his unit went on record questioning whether or not he was a deserter. These were credible folks who knew what they were talking about. The president decided to play this up. I think it not only makes him look foolish in hindsight, I think it was a mistake strategically. It sent a signal of weakness to the Taliban, to the terrorists. It said we were tired of this fight, we were ready to cut deals. I don't know if has emboldened other groups like ISIS.Related Topics: Jason Riley, Susan Rice, Barack Obama, Bowe BergdahlCommentShow commentsHide CommentsRCP Log In | RegisterPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Latest Political VideosVideo ArchivesSign up for RC newslettersÂ©2016 RealClearPolitics | Go to full site"
