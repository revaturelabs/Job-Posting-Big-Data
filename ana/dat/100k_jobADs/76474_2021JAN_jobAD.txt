Couple of photos attached at end of post.Sorry that I omitted to report on yesterday’s mileage, total was 378 including the evening excursion into St E.Today the plan is to continue onto Grenoble, famous for the Winter Olympics in, I think, 1968. Then follow the Route Napoléon to Gap and on to Barcelonette and o/n in Jausiers. Weather is now sweltering, but will doubtless get cooler as the climb into the mountains begins.Ride hard, ride a Harley!DookesLe BessatEx CdF Vivrais Loco in TournonThe Rhone at TournonShare this:EmailFacebookWhatsAppTwitterLike this:Like Loading...This entry was posted in Uncategorized by HogriderDookes.

By tonight you’ll be up around 850 I guess – we only did 900ish in 5 days! Weather better here today thankfully. And thanks for the riding advice but I’ll stick with me Honda – upon which I hope to emulate these mileages in 2013 – for fear of being left behind!!LikeLikeReply ↓	hogriderdookes on June 17, 2012 at 10:58 am said:It’s OK Vifferman, you soon get the hang of it!LikeLikeReply ↓	spike on June 17, 2012 at 12:23 pm said:Well why ll im in a large Q in toby carvery, awaiting my 1st takeaway !!
