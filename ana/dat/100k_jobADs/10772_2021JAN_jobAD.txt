The amount of the bonus will probably be different from person to person depending on their role within the organization.Goal-Based BonusesGranted upon achieving an important goal or milestone.Holiday / End of Year BonusesThese types of bonuses are given without a reason and usually resemble an appreciation token.Bonuses Are Not Commissions!People tend to confuse bonuses with commissions. A commission is a prefixed rate at which someone gets paid for items sold or deals completed while a bonus is in most cases arbitrary and unplanned.What makes a position worthy of good bonuses and a high salary?The main two types of jobsRevenue Generators Supporting CastEmployees that are directly involved in generating revenue or profit for the organization. Their field of expertise usually matches the type of business.Employees that support and facilitate the work of revenue generators. Their expertise is usually different from that of the core business operations.Example:A graphics designer working for a graphics designing company.Example:A graphic designer in the marketing department of a hospital.Revenue generators usually get more and higher bonuses, higher salaries, and more frequent salary increments. The reason is quite simple: it is easier to quantify your value to the company in monetary terms when you participate in revenue generation.“Try to work for companies where your skills can generate revenue. We can't all generate revenue and that's perfectly fine.”Bonus Comparison by Seniority LevelTop management personnel and senior employees naturally exhibit higher bonus rates and frequencies than juniors. This is very predictable due to the inherent responsibilities of being higher in the hierarchy.
