What they mean is something that has regular hours and a guarenteed pay cheque at the end of the week. Usually this suggestion comes from people that earn their living this way.I'm the first to admit that working for yourself is a hard way to make a living - especially in the beginning. However I think if you believe in yourself and back yourself 100% the payoff in the long run will be better than any regular job.With all the skills I've acquired over the years people are often surprised that I haven't been able to find a regular job (especially those job search co-ordinator people who circle like a vulture when they think I'm an easy prospect for job placement).It is precisely because of all these skills that I find regular work...well...depressing. I'm not just saying that either. I've had regular jobs and followed the gradual spiral down into monotony and boredom. It's just not me.Working for ones self is challenging. Working for ones self as an artist is doubly, even triply (is that even a word?) challenging. It is very hard and I'm always struggling just to make ends meet. I can say that it isn't boring or monotonous but it can be depressing.What would be useful is, if all those people who've suggested I need a real job, offered words of encouragement instead. Or better yet, offered to refer their friends to my site just for a look...and maybe hinted that they can buy gifts of my art too.That would be far more beneficial than telling me I need to get a job.ShareGet linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther AppsLabelsArt Business Life ObservationsTET Life Topics: Art Business Life ObservationsShareGet linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther AppsCommentsAnonymous June 04, 2006 7:53 AMAmen to that! Being an artist is TOUGH and it would be soooo much easier to go and wait tables for some easy cash but that's not what life is all about. I feel sorry for those who are living their lives unconsciously. At the end of my life when God asks me \"So what did you like the best?\" I know I'm going to have lots of good answers.ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyTET (David Arandle) June 04, 2006 10:06 PMThanks for Commenting Lauren. I think in the beginning getting a regular paying job sounds like an easy option but as time goes on those jobs get harder and harder (unless of course you actually enjoy those kind of jobs). Each to their own...if you don't like what you're doing now, take a risk and live a little...:)ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAnonymous June 05, 2006 8:41 PMWell, I enjoyed my job when I was young, back in the sixties in the UK of being a window dresser in the ladies fashion shops! (3 altogether until I came to Oz at the age of 20yrs, and only married for about 18mths!)I knew at age 12yrs that I wanted to do window dressing after seeing a comedy film with veteran comic (now) Norman Wisdom (WHO, I hear you all say!) who was pretending to dress a large store window with china, though he didn't work there, just fooling around.People were anxious to get me into the cotton mills in my village, which is where a few of my less inspiring friends went because of the good pay, but even though I came from a mill family, I was determined that I wasn't going in the MILL!! The Careers people that came to the school to see what you wanted to do when it came near for you to leave tried to convince me that I was a 'factory' type and not a 'shop' type with being so quiet, but I wasn't having it, and ignored them! I haven't regretted it!My pay was only half what they got, and I had to begin as a Junior making tea, shopping for lunches, vacuuming, dusting, waiting on reception to direct customers, washing up and general dogsbody, but became a window dresser in the end.I didn't get to work in the big stores which is what I really wanted, so as to do backgrounds which was art etc, but one store used travelling men window dressers, and another told me for the 3 attempts I had at getting in at different ages, that you had to have a GCE certficate in at least 3 subjects! At least I got to do what I wanted to do, and it was regular work, but not a flash wage unless you were serving and getting commission, which I did do a bit of when it was busy.I would have liked to have gone to art college, but that didn't come about, so I have TET/David and my daughter Lesley to live that through instead!ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyTET (David Arandle) June 06, 2006 1:51 PMThanks for the comment (or is that essay?), Mum :)I guess you could say I take after you...in that I'm not settling for anything that other people tell me I should do. I'm following the job, career path I want.BTW: It's never too late to go to art college...I know people who have retired that are still going to art school simply because they now have the time to do art.ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAdd commentLoad more...Post a CommentComments not directly related to the post will be deleted.

Today's guest post is by Artist, Writer, and Mental Health Advocate, Jo B Creative who writes for her blog, Creating My Oddessey . Y ou should see our (almost) brand new conservatory, half of which is my art studio. 'Lucky me!' I think to myself. Not every creative bod can boast that. It's HUGE! Like a giant greenhouse. We first moved to our pleasant cul-de-sac house - great for raising kids - when our son, who's on the cusp of thirty-one, was four. One of the main reasons that we wanted it was that, apart from its location on the fringes of a historic market town in rural Hampshire, UK, it had a sizable conservatory looking onto the back garden. It was brown wood framed and had a corrugated transparent roof sloping down from downstairs ceiling height. On the face of it, it doesn't sound that glamourous, but we loved the idea of a conservatory. Luxury! I even liked the red brick walls which it was built against -ShareGet linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther AppsPost a CommentContinue Reading »Batman v Superman: Dawn of the Onesie #SadbatmanBy TET (David Arandle) June 03, 2014Although we haven't seen it clearly for sure, film director Kevin Smith (who has seen a well lit, color photo of the suit), says Ben Affleck's Bat costume is pretty much identical to the Frank Miller, Dark Knight Returns suit. If that's true then Ben's world weary Batman will be going 'old school' and be wearing his underpants on the outside (as he should).ShareGet linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther AppsPost a CommentContinue Reading »The Star Wars Saga: Episode II, Attack of the Clones *All Spoilers*By TET (David Arandle) October 16, 2015Continuing my series of posts, as one of my local TV stations shows every Star Wars movie in order, every Saturday, for the next six weeks leading up to the release of Star Wars, Episode VII, The Force Awakens , here is my response to and thoughts on Star Wars, Episode II, Attack of the Clones . After The Phantom Menace I just wasn't interested in seeing Episode II in the cinema. I don't think I made any effort to see it or even had any anticipation for it's release.ShareGet linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther AppsPost a CommentContinue Reading »The Star Wars Saga: Episode 1, The Phantom Menace *All Spoilers*By TET (David Arandle) October 07, 2015One of my local TV stations is showing every Star Wars movie in order, every Saturday, for the next six weeks leading up to the release of Star Wars, Episode VII, The Force Awakens in theaters this Christmas. I plan to watch each film, at least two of which I've never managed to watch all the way through. Then I thought I'd blog about each movie here. Not so much a review but more my thoughts about the film, ranging from what I like, to what I see as a problem and maybe my thoughts on original trilogy re-releases and updates. This post I'll start with Episode I, The Phantom Menace but first, a little history of my fandom.ShareGet linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther AppsPost a CommentContinue Reading »getpaidtodraw.com - Your Questions Answered.By TET (David Arandle) December 02, 2007Is it a scam? Is the sales message too good to be true? Can you really sit back, relax and get paid thousands of dollars in residual payments? If you've discovered the site getpaidtodraw.com and have been looking for someone who has bought this product before taking that leap then this review will peel back the glossy sales message and give you the answers. Prior to buying this product I came across much distrust and misinformation about getpaidtodraw.com by people who hadn't purchased it. There was a real need for information so I decided to take the leap and make the purchase specifically so I could write this informed review. Note that I am not, in any way, a getpaidtodraw.com affiliate. For this review I will be focusing on the getpaidtodraw system which includes; the ebook, instructional videos and database along with access to the systems author Jules Camber (who replies to emails as 'Jamie, President of Champ Entertainment, Inc and Beats365, LLC').

How to grow your YouTube Channel into a BusinessBy TET (David Arandle) October 20, 2020YouTube for Bosses Free Mug... or the most expensive mug you'll ever buy? I've been subscribed to Sunny Lenarduzzi's YouTube channel for a few years, learning a lot on how to grow a following on sites like YouTube and Instagram. If you have any interest in growing your own YouTube channel I'd highly recommend watching some of Sunny's videos on the subject. Definitely explore her 2019 back catalogue for the most useful information. This year she's been on a bit of a 'being authentic' pivot that, personally, doesn't resonate all that much with me (but probably speaks volumes to anyone with similar experience). I'm not saying she shouldn't or isn't being authentic, it's just I didn't subscribe to hear stories about her life journey. To get back on track, Sunny runs a successful online business with her flagship course, YouTube for Bosses , a stand alone paid course that does act as something of a gateway to further paid (but optShareGet linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther Apps2 commentsContinue Reading »Random Face Sketches to Robot Warrior Character DesignBy TET (David Arandle) August 21, 2018Future Soldier design by TET. Continuing on from my last post about the value of drawing without purpose , my latest video unintentionally demonstrates the point again. I set out to try and come up with something to draw for my next skateboarding/art video but didn't have any ideas in mind so I just started drawing faces. By the end of the session I had six very different faces drawn on a page in my sketch book.ShareGet linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther Apps1 commentContinue Reading »Subscribe to the TET Life Newsletter* indicates requiredEmail Address *Name *View previous campaigns.Explore TET Life by TopicArt159Books36Business59Environment17Health and Well Being16Humor83Internet and Technology145Life Observations144Movies and Entertainment184Music29News and Events46Politics23Product Reviews16Skateboarding44Travel and Places78Weird and Unusual25World Issues31Show more Show lessArchive2021 3January 32020 35December 2November 1October 3September 6August 4July 4June 4May 1March 3February 4January 32019 50December 3November 3October 5September 4August 4July 5June 4May 4April 5March 4February 4January 52018 53December 3November 3October 6September 4August 7July 5June 3May 4April 7March 2February 4January 52017 51December 7November 8October 5September 3August 6July 4June 2May 5April 4March 3February 1January 32016 45December 3November 4October 4September 3August 4July 4June 3May 5April 4March 5February 3January 32015 41December 3November 4October 3September 4August 4July 4June 5May 2April 3March 5February 2January 22014 33December 4November 4October 2July 1June 2May 4April 5March 4February 4January 32013 40December 5November 2September 1August 2July 5June 4May 6April 2March 4February 4January 52012 42December 4November 4October 6September 1August 1June 4May 5April 4March 4February 4January 52011 31December 4November 3October 7September 3August 7July 1May 1March 2February 2January 12010 12December 1October 1June 2April 2March 1February 2January 32009 48December 2November 4October 2September 2August 3July 1May 9April 12March 6February 2January 52008 67December 3November 3October 8September 9August 4July 12June 9May 1April 2March 3February 4January 92007 144December 8November 6October 16September 3August 10July 14June 26May 23April 21March 12February 2January 32006 38December 2November 3October 5September 3August 6July 3June 3May 4The Da'Vinci Code - TET's Movie ReviewI'll Pencil You in...Get a job...\"You are the Generation that bought more shoes...\"April 2March 2February 4January 12005 2December 22004 2December 2Show more Show lessRecommended Links/Sites:How to Start a Print on Demand Business (Part 1)Start a POD with The Print Bar (Aust)Brand Famous - Linzi BoydThe Working Artist - Crista CloutierSide Hustle School - Chris GuillebeauFlying Solo Micro Business CommunityProBlogger - Darren RowseRaelyn Tan - Blog BusinessSmart Passive Income - Pat FlynnBecoming a YouTube Millionaire - Sunny LenarduzziFree YouTube Training - Sunny LenarduzziStrategy for YouTube Views - Sunny LenarduzziWrite From ScratchEp62 How Thoughts Can Heal (Mind Your Business Podcast)Ultimate Freedom - Robert ScheinfeldSite InformationAbout TET LifeMy other blog: Animation and Video LifeContact & Copyright InformationPrivacy PolicyNeed a Mailing List provider?
