The MapReduce programming model helps programmers write distributed applications on large clusters, but requires dealing with complex implementation details (e.g., reasoning with data distribution and overall system configuration). Recent proposals, such as Scope, raise the level of abstraction by providing a declarative language that not only increases programming productivity but is also amenable to sophisticated optimization. Like in traditional database systems, such optimization relies on detailed data statistics to choose the best execution plan in a cost-based fashion. However, in contrast to database systems, it is very difficult to obtain and maintain good quality statistics in a highly distributed environment that contains tens of thousands of machines. In this paper, we describe mechanisms to capture data statistics concurrently with job execution and automatically exploit them for optimizing a class of recurring jobs. We achieve this goal by instrumenting different job stages and piggybacking statistics collection with the normal execution of a job. After collecting such statistics, we show how to feed them back to the query optimizer so that future invocations of the same (or similar) jobs take advantage of accurate statistics. We implemented this approach in the Scope system at Microsoft, which runs over tens of thousands of machines and processes over 30 thousand jobs daily, 40% of which have a recurring pattern.Authors: Nicolas Bruno, Sameer Agarwal, Srikanth Kandula, Bing Shi, Ming-Chuan Wu, Jingren ZhouPublication Date: May 2012Conference: Industrial Paper, ACM SIGMOD ConferenceDownload PDF: Recurring-SCOPE-SIGMOD12﻿Publications201220112010TagsAkaros amp application Approximate Query Processing BDAS Best Paper Award Big Data BlinkDB Bootstrap cluster coflow consistency crowdsourcing databases Datacenters data centers Data Cleaning data quality Declarative ML distributed machine learning genomics Graphs hadoop Machine Learning Materialized Views matrix factorization mesos MLbase Optimization OS pbs PIQL query processing Sampling SCADS scalability scale independence scheduling Shark spark SQL storage Succinct transactions vldbCome VisitContactOpen PositionsAboutPeoplePublicationsProjectsSeminarsBlog: AMP BLABSponsorsPhotosWikiJenkinsCopyright © 2021 AMPLab"
