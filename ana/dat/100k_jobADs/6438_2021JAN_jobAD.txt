Political science teaches students to analyze the origins and development of political systems and structures -- important skills to have and skills that can be valuable in very different work environments.JournalismYou don’t need a journalism degree to be a journalist. In fact, you may have a better chance of becoming a journalist if you have a degree that helps you specialize in a certain area. With a bachelor’s degree in political science, politics could easily become your beat. You can take many different routes to reach a career in journalism: blogging, radio, newspaper and television. In each case, political reporters with sharp analytical and communication skills are highly prized.Think TanksPolitical science academics aren’t the only people who research politics for a living. Think-tank analysts are often more prolific researchers, and much more influential, than their academic counterparts. Take the skills you learned in academia -- how to investigate political phenomena -- and apply them to contemporary issues. If you work for a think tank that is fortunate (and skilled) enough to have the ear of the government, you may be surprised at how much change you can affect in the very political system that you study.Government EmployeeFew people are more qualified to work in government than someone who devoted years of post-secondary education to studying government. A large proportion of political science graduates go on to work for different levels of government in different branches and in different areas from issues management for top senators to research analysis for fisheries. Their education equips them with the necessary understanding of policy-making and politicking so that they’re able to navigate government with ease.Political LobbyistA political science degree won’t just help you work for the government; it will help you lobby the government. Political lobbyists try to influence lawmakers through persuasion and relationship-building. Like lawyers and politicians, lobbyists often get a bad reputation, but this reputation is often undeserved. Like lawyers and politicians, most lobbyists use excellent communication skills and a solid understanding of legislation to affect change. So don’t knock political lobbying until you try it. And with a degree that helps you understand the machinery of politics, there’s a very good chance that you’ll be able to.ReferencesMcGill University: What Can I Do With My Studies in Political Science?Bureau of Labor Statistics: Political ScientistsWriter BioLiving in Canada, Andrew Aarons has been writing professionally since 2003.
