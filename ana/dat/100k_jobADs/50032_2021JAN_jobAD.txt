For one, I have purchased a high-tech home alarm system that automatically phones the cops whenever it detects a break-in.Now every time my spouse and I go out on the town, we employ a caregiver to watch our kids. However, she did not feel comfortable leaving our children in the hands of a stranger. Thus, to reassure her, I obtained a high quality hidden camera with a built in DVR as well.Monitoring cameras are used for discreetly monitoring activity in a particular area. They are made to resemble normal household items and match their surroundings in order that nobody will suspect being watched.The spy camera that we purchased included a built-in DVR and required no additional instillation other than to take it out of the box. Its DVR contained every function necessary to start recording footage immediately.The DVR allows for video playback in two ways. First, you can connect it to a standard television set making use of the provided RCA cable. Second, you can take out the provided SD memory card and download its content to a personal computer with a card reader.What I purchased was an hidden camera dvr iPod dock station that features a completely working iPod dock. It uses Apples Universal Dock and works with any iPod. We positioned it on top of our entertainment system to watch over our living room.It really works as advertised and records high quality video for the price. Since it functions as a working iPod dock station, we make use of it to actually play music whenever we have guests around. It doesn’t occur to them that its also a video camera. This motion activated spy cam dvr will covertly monitor your home to make sure there aren’t any unauthorized visitors in the home while your away.We bought additional covert cameras for other areas in and around our house and each one is a high quality hidden camera just like the first. We have no had any problems with babysitters but when we do we can rest easy knowing that we can keep an eye on them.Finally, the best spy cam to buy features safe contained built-in dvr.Post navigation← Previous PostNext Post →Leave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
