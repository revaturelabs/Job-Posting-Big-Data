See you around!High winds… [Job 38-41]Filed under: Christianity, creation, Encouragement, Faith, Inspiration, Protection, Uncategorized — 2 Comments	November 29, 2012In 2005 a neighboring town was hit hard by a tornado [Stoughton Tornado]. My family and I were at our local pool when the sirens sounded and we were sent to the locker rooms for cover. Of course being the wanna-be storm chasers my husband and I are, we went outside while my Mom took the kids into safety.The enormous twister passed by right in front of us, miles across, spinning and howling as it moved.We could see and feel the force of it’s incredible, terrifying, strength and power yet from where we stood we were safe. We were within arms reach (ok so we’re not so brave) of protection.The Bible paints pictures of God’s strength and power;“And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.” 1 Kings 19:11-12It reveals the amazing ability God has to control things that seem so out of control;Frightening storms:“And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Hush, be still.” And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm.” Mark 4:39Fearsome beasts:“Behold now, Behemoth, which I made as well as you… If a river rages, he is not alarmed; He is confident, though the Jordan rushes to his mouth. Can anyone capture him when he is on watch, With barbs can anyone pierce his nose?” Job 40:15, 23-24“Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord? No one is so fierce that he dares to arouse him…” Job 41:1, 10And when God finally shows up to speak to Job in chapters 38-41, he reveals His power, not only through His words but also in his appearance:“Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind…” Job 38:1 (also Job 40:6)God can be seen through all kinds of storms; roaring winds and drenching rain, financial drought or despairing loneliness but His Word reminds us that He is the one in control.“Whatever the LORD pleases, He does, In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps.” Psalm 135:6Like Scott Krippane’s song says…“Sometimes He calms the stormWith a whispered ‘Peace, be still’He can settle any seaBut it doesn’t mean He willSometimes He holds us closeAnd lets the wind and waves go wildSometimes He calms the stormAnd other times He calms His child.”-Scott KrippaneRelated posts/articles:The witching hour… (https://ispygod.net/)I Spy A Fierce Dragon (https://ispygod.net/)Out of the whirlwind (http://cindybythesea.wordpress.com/)Lessons From The Whirlwind (http://www.teachingtruth.org/)Share this:TweetMoreShare on TumblrEmailLike this:Like Loading...RelatedTags: God is in control, God's power, Job 38, Job 39, Job 40, Job 41, nature, storm, Stoughton tornado, weatherComments RSS feed2 Trackbacks / Pingbacks for this entry:I finally finished Job!!! « I Spy God[…] [Job 32] Shhhh…God always has an answer [Job 33] The witching hour… [Job 38-39] High Winds… [Job […]Daily Bible walk: Day 260 | I Spy God[…] Posts: High winds… [Job 38-41] I finally finished […]Leave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
