Everyone who consumes water must Rally for Rivers.\" - SadhguruWater is one of the most fundamental requirements for life. But the most important source of water - our rivers - are facing a grave crisis. In just one generation, India's perennial rivers are turning seasonal. Many smaller rivers have already vanished. If we do not act now to reverse this, the legacy we hand over to the next generation will be one of conflict and deprivation.To revitalize our rivers, Rally for Rivers proposes tree plantation on riversides through governmental policy. To garner public support for the cause, in September 2017, Sadhguru personally drove from Kanyakumari to the Himalayas. Over 100 million people pledged their support, and the draft policy recommendation was presented to the Prime Minister.The next phase of implementation will require lots of hands-on, on-site effort.https://isha.sadhguru.org/rally-for-rivers/https://www.facebook.com/RallyForRiversSupporters/Read more about Isha Foundation...Purpose of the JobVisiting Farmers guiding them to select the correct Species for the FarmJob ResponsibilitiesVisiting Farmers guiding them to select the correct Species for the FarmRequired CompetenciesEducational Qualification : GraduateSkill Competencies : Good networking skillsExperience : 0 ~ 3yearsGender : MaleWhat do we look for in our candidates?Entrepeneural Spirit and an egoless nature.Proven work ethic with utmost integrity and desire to excel and succeed.Self motivated, passionate, empathetic and approachable.You love to have fun, but you also take your responsibilities seriously.Interested?Apply Now!Contact usPhone: (0422) 2515609 / 2515610Email: hrd@ishafoundation.orgIsha Yoga CenterVelliangiri FoothillsIshana Vihar PostCoimbatore â€“ 641 114Tamil Nadu, India."
