One day, she heard a gospel song on the radio, which led her to think about Christianity. She decided to accept Christ as her Lord and Savior. When her family learned about her decision, they kicked her out. Binsa went to Kathmandu, the capital city, in search of work to support herself. She found a job in a coffee shop and rented a small room. On her day off, she attended church. But when the coffee shop owner learned she was a Christian, he fired her. For four months Binsa couldn’t pay her rent and often went hungry until a VOM-supported evangelist found her and provided help. Pray for Binsa and pray for her family to come to know Christ as she did.I Commit To Pray•News28 views0 commentsRecent PostsSee AllLaos: Worship Continues in Spite of Persecution and Tight Conditions110Ethiopia: Pastor Martyred While Preaching160Nigeria: Testimony of Mashingil Philemon160DONATEDownload The VOM PRAY TODAY AppListen online to VOMRadio© 2018 CMI VOMSA"
