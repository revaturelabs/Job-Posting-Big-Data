I, for one, am looking forward to (and totally not pre-emptively exhausted by) the internet discussion about how The Rise of Skywalker either saves or ruins Star Wars, and by extension, our childhoods and sense of selves.I wonder if the release schedule is just naturally winding down after a big 3 months, or if everyone is steering clear of 19-20 December because of the new Star Wars, and the sheer Force of merch that will Awaken and be Unleashed? This is also the time of year when we start to look back upon the games of 2019, and work out which of them deserve a number between 1 and 10 next to their name.One of the weird things about Steam’s near-total lack of vetting what is sold on its platform is that you get topical games. You know how a lot of people hold SNL to a lower standard of quality because it’s topical, and they only get a week do to each show? This doesn’t translate well to videogames. It takes more than a week to make a game, so something topical usually has some very basic mechanics wrapped up in a catchphrase ripped from the headlines. This week’s topical game is OK Boomer, a rudimentary horde shooter. It’s not so much trying to say anything, as it is hoping that you’ll buy a sub-standard game because it mentions a meme. As a Gen-Xer, I’m often pressed into the generation wars—the one thing Millennials and Boomers can agree on is how much Gen-Xers suck—but this game ain’t it.Wattam is the latest from Keita Takahashi, the designer of Katamari Damacy and Noby Noby Boy. He says there’s too many games based on conflict and fighting, so he makes games that foster a sense of play without those dynamics. Wattam is a friendship game. You start out as the mayor of an empty town who wants to make friends. As you help people in odd but sweet ways, new friends will join your town and your roster of playable characters. The vibe is exploration and whimsy, rather than high scores and a compelling story.The very delightful Untitled Goose Game honks its way on to non-Switch platforms this week and would make a nice gift for a gamer of any age.Borderlands 3 gets an expansion: Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot. It’s a raid on Handsome Jack’s casino, with new enemies and Legendary loot, but not new Vault Hunter classes or skill trees.3M SPAIN FOUNDATION - STEM+VR is an educational PSVR experience. It has 4 scenarios, one each for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. It’s designed for groups of 3 to learn and collaborate to complete challenges. While I can’t fault the intent, it looks weird seeing an educational product clearly made for middle-school kids festooned with Sony’s typical disclaimers that kids 12 and under should not use VR.I’ll give a GOTW to Wattam for looking for its fun in a different place and embracing the whimsy. Too often in video games, we focus on the results rather than the journey. Kudos to Wattam for positing that being fun and kind is its own reward.Here's the list, now in release-date order!PC12-16Galactic ManagementJinga OnlineBillion BeatI Can't Believe It's Not Gambling 2(K)Eternal BattlefieldRacer SimulatorBomber FoxBottler3000Tales of BeasteriaGround WarParticulateSlippery SausageWorld of relishSapper12-17WattamPotataThe Sims 4: Discover UniversityMagical PrincessBloody trainsRealms of DarknessAery VRImpossiball - Gamers ChallengeKILL THE EMOJI - THE REMAKEEndless SkiROAD HOMEWARD: Open worldWoodle Tree 2: Deluxe+Periodic DeliveriesTsumi Teki Dai Shichi ShouTERMINALEscape the Ninja RoomTiamat's DrinkFrontline: The Great Patriotic WarPlanet Zoo: Arctic PackMerge Towers12-18Survival HellZombie SeasonOrbital ShipyardsTip of the Spear: Task Force ElitePizza Time ExplosionFighting MooreTOTALLY BASEBALLFight of AnimalsMineirinho Director's CutCave to KingdomSWEATER?

Pretty sure they own every right under the sun to the words \"Tales of\".I'm curious about Wattam. I sure hope it turns out decent, unlike Noby Noby which was just weird beyond the point of being interesting.NSMike wrote:How did I live before digital distribution of old, cheap games?MilkmanDanimal wrote:You did live before digital distribution of old, cheap games.
