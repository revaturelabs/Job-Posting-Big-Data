The MSP Stimulus Pledge (www.mspstimuluspledge.com) is a collective of peers and competitors in the IT Services industry committing to using government assistance, including PPP funds, as intended: to keep team members employed and keep the economy moving.“I am thankful for my friend Peter Melby’s leadership in our industry” said CHTS CEO, Michael Escalera. “When Peter contacted me about the pledge, I immediately wanted to support it. As a small business, Colorado Hi-Tech Solutions has already suffered from the impacts of Coronavirus. If CHTS receives stimulus funds, I am committed to the funds going 100% to support and protect the 20 Team Members in our organization.”“Many people don’t realize that IT service is more of a people business than a technology business.” says Peter Melby, CEO of Greystone Technology who spearheaded the movement. “IT management and security have never been more critical than they are right now. If used as intended, the stimulus program has given our industry and opportunity to become collectively stronger which will be necessary to help businesses overcome the challenges that we will continue to see as we move into an uncertain future.”The MSP Stimulus Pledge brings regional and national competitors together for the greater good of employees, the industry, and the business community.Learn more, sign the pledge, and see the pledging companies at www.mspstimuluspledge.com.The PledgeThe MSP Stimulus Pledge asks organizations to use stimulus funds to commit to:· Avoiding layoffs of staff and pay reductions· Paying bills on time· Providing no increase in owner’s compensation· Working as partners with our vendors without demanding concessions simply because we can use the leverage of economic conditions· Running our businesses in a manner that creates a strong foundation for our employees and clients into a new futureCHTS News•MSP•IT Industry11 views0 commentsRecent PostsSee AllFBI Releases Urgent Warning for Health Care Sector40Team Member Minute: Managing Crisis with CEO Michael Escalera320Team Member Minute: Project Management and its Importance110Schedule a Free Consultation!If you are looking for an IT company who cares about you and your business then call us to learn more.
