Think about your current job and your relevant skills, how can you translate these to make yourself appear more desirable to a prospective employer? Develop an action plan by setting long and short-term goals, but remember why you are doing this and realise that achieving these goals will take time, hard work and patience.Update your CVOne of the first steps on your action plan should be to update your CV. If you are struggling to know where to start and what employers are looking for, a good idea is to read through the job pages and scan the internet to discover the specific skills that organisations are looking for in your particular role.Then tailor your CV to fit the role. All the information on your CV should be relevant and it must always include the basics, such as name, location, contact details and notice period. Chartered memberships and industry qualifications are also extremely desirable to new employers. They provide tangible evidence that not only are you interested in the construction industry, but that you are actively contributing to it.First impressions lastRemember that first impressions are key. Take the time to get your CV just right and don't forget to check your spelling and grammar.If you are invited to an interview then it is a sure sign that the company feels you have relevant skills and experience to contribute. Preparation is now vital to ensure that all your hard work updating your CV does not go to waste. Use a number of different methods to research the company such as the Internet, industry publications, the company website and discreet enquiries with associates. Also, practise speaking at length about any work experience and skills you possess and if possible, take along a portfolio of your work. Be punctual for the interview and focus on clearly demonstrating why you should get the job.If you are changing jobs for the wrong reasons the outcome can be a disaster. But if you follow a comprehensive action plan, take your time and put in the effort with all aspects of the recruitment process, the only way is up!Greg Lettington is director of Hays Construction & Property.Email thisFacebookTwitterLinkedInPinterestRedditBack to listingTopVisit our other websitesBuilding DesignBD4jobsBuildingAbout UsContact UsTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyAdvertise with usTwitterÂ© 2012 - 2021 Copyright Building4Jobs.
