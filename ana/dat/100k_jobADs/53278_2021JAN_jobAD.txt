ChinaComments for Senior Landscape Architect——work location：ChinaAverage RatingClick here to add your own commentsNov 22, 2010RatingCV for your considerationby: Adam LittlefieldI am an Australian living in Shenzhen for 2.5 years initially working as Design Leader with Osborne Landscape Design and most recently Design Director with L&A. Throughout my 15 year career I have focused my design and project experience on developments in China. Most of these have been residential masterplanning and hotel, resort style developments. Prior to living in Shenzhen I was appointed Senior designer with a firm in Adelaide, Australia, called Swanbury Penglase. This office was in partnership with a local Shenzhen office, Thinker, focusing on a partnership between the two called SP&T International and thus contributes to five years of direct involvement in Chinese projects.I have interest in leading a team with a major design role, while overseeing the design development and documentation. My ability to mentor staff to translate my dynamic and workable design solutions through various media is what I can offer. I have had 6 years experience with EDAW Australia, then Arterra Design in Sydney, Patio in Dubai, Swanbury Penglase in Adelaide, Osborne Design and L&A in Shenzhen.Although born Australian, I have travelled extensively throughout the world. I spent my early years living in England as well as travelling through Europe, Middle East, USA and 42 cities in China. Other travels include a 1 year scholarship to the University of Georgia, USA, where I achieved two Deans List Accreditations in 1994-5. For three consecutive years 1998-2000, following graduation, I was nominated for the ‘Young Australian of the Year Award’ in career achievement. In addition to Landscape Architecture work, I was recognized for my research in energy efficiency and water management and the formation of an underground house design based on my Honours thesis that utilises the earth elements to maintain itself as a total living environment. Most recently I have led designs with environmentally sustainable initiatives mainly focusing on water management through capture, storage, treatment and reuse.I am very loyal and dedicated and can bring a unique and energetic character to the workplace. With respect and compassion involved, I challenge the normal and express my diversity through design. Essentially I believe in my designs and have the ability to portray and sell that design to the client, with flexibility and excitement. I have a plethora of working expamples and would welcome the opportunity to negatiate with you to be considered for a position.Thanks for your time,Adam Littlefield13530207016Click here to add your own commentsJoin in and write your own page!
