First Day [of Work]If you know me personally or follow me on Snap or Insta, you've probably figured out by now that I have a new job. I am so beyond excited to start this new chapter that I could just jump and yell and scream and sing butttt instead I'm taking a deep breathe and getting ready for a what's sure to be a wild ride. Today is the first day at said job and while I'm excited I'm slightly terrified. But terrified in the best way possible (I once read an article about a really successful person and they said fear is what fueled them so a little bit of fear in new adventures is definitely a good thing). I'll get into the nitty gritty as to why I'm terrified and how this whole job came about soon but all I know is I'm so ready for this change.I'm taking this as an opportunity to start fresh, create a new routine and really reset things. Not that I've done anything seriously wrong in my last role or life but the 60-70 hour work weeks, not being able to workout regularly or eat right have really taken a toll on me. I know there's hard work and working long hours to get things done sometimes but my last job is a little too stressful at times. It wasn't all for naught because I learned a tremendous amount and it helped me forge the connections I needed for this newest endeavor. And let's just say I'm ready to really start living this life I've built in the city.And first things first, I'm taking control of my workout routine and my finances. After reading all the Refinery29 money/personal finance articles this year, I decided to purchase a Stash Wealth plan to really start setting myself up for future goals. I was so excited when I got the email that my plan was ready - so now it's time to implement it!I'm also excited to announce I'm working on a mini career series to talk about my experiences through the job search process, give interview tips and also talk about transitioning your wardrobe for a new job. Stay tuned and I hope you'll come on this ride with me!Chic Wish Lace Crop Top (similar here), Banana Republic Fluted Skirt (similar here and here), C.Wonder Leopard Espadrilles (similar here), GiGi New York Crossbody (c/o)PS - no, this not what I'm actually wearing to work today - the skirt is a little too short for the new office environment ;). Head to Insta to see the real outfit!Get the Look:JavaScript is currently disabled in this browser.
