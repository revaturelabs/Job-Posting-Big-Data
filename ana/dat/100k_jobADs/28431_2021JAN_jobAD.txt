It said last month that 2020 revenues would drop to $419bn, down 50% from 2019.BA has insisted that it is doing its best to save jobs. On Thursday, Willie Walsh, the boss of BA owner IAG told the BBC that the coronavirus crisis was the worst the company has faced in its history.IAG reported a loss of €4.2bn (£3.8bn) for the first half of the year, and Mr Walsh said it would take until at least 2023 for passenger levels to recover.However, there is anger from staff over the way in which BA has approached job cuts, according to the BBC’s business correspondent Theo Leggett.For cabin crew, there is not only the threat of redundancy, but also the possibility of big pay cuts for long-serving staff – in some cases of more than 50%.Many of those affected believe the company is using the current crisis to force through changes it has wanted to make for years.Longer-serving crew at BA have contracts which are, by modern standards, relatively generous. They date back to an era when the airline industry was less ferociously competitive, before the emergence of budget carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet forced older airlines to cut costs and change their business models.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Share on Skype (Opens in new window)RelatedRelated ItemsacceptairwaysbritishpilotsUK31st July 2020Newsexplored @newsexploredwebRelated ItemsacceptairwaysbritishpilotsMore in UKRead MoreStorm Christoph: Evacuations amid floods and snowViews:2 Published 14 minutes ago image copyrightPA Media image captionHomes near Lymm in Cheshire were among those...Newsexplored 31st July 2020Read MoreStorm Christoph in picturesViews:2 Storm Christoph has swept across the UK, bringing heavy rain, flooding and snow to parts of...Newsexplored 31st July 2020Read MoreStorm Christoph: Homes evacuated in Wales amid severe flood warningViews:2 image captionUp to 30 people have been forced out of their homes in Bangor-on-Dee, Wrexham Homes...Newsexplored 31st July 2020Read MoreNewspaper headlines: ‘New dawn for America’ as Joe Biden takes overViews:2 By BBC NewsStaff image captionPhotographs from Joe Biden’s inauguration as the 46th US president feature across...Newsexplored 31st July 2020Read MoreScotland’s papers: Restrictions ‘for months’ and Trump’s exitViews:2 Daily Record The Herald The Scotsman The Scottish Sun The National The Times Daily Mail Daily...Newsexplored 31st July 2020Read MoreNewspaper headlines: ‘It’s the back of Trump’ and ‘vaccine pivot’Views:2 By BBC NewsStaff image captionAll of Wednesday’s front pages carry a mention of Joe Biden’s inauguration...Newsexplored 31st July 2020Read MoreStorm Christoph: Flood warnings in parts of EnglandViews:2 image captionIn Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, residents have prepared their homes and businesses ahead of the...Newsexplored 31st July 2020Read MoreNewspaper headlines: Jab complacency fears and smart motorway inquestViews:2 By BBC NewsStaff image captionThe Daily Telegraph says government scientific advisers are concerned millions of people...Newsexplored 31st July 2020Read MoreManchester Arena Inquiry: Help given to Saffie-Rose Roussos to be examinedViews:2 image copyrightFamily handouts image captionTop row (left to right): Alison Howe, Martyn Hett, Lisa Lees, Courtney...Newsexplored 31st July 2020Read MoreEngland: Phil Neville leaves Lionesses manager roleViews:2 Phil Neville has left his role as manager of England’s women and is set to take...Newsexplored 31st July 2020Read MoreScotland’s papers: Army leads vaccine rollout and ‘patchy supplies’Views:2 Daily Record The Herald The Scotsman The Scottish Sun The National The Times Daily Mail Daily...Newsexplored 31st July 2020Read MoreSri Lanka v England: Tourists win first Test by seven wicketsViews:2 Dan Lawrence scored 94 runs and Jonny Bairstow 82 in the match First Test, Galle (day...Newsexplored 31st July 2020Scroll for moreTapdata-ad-format=\"auto\">NewsExplored - Making sure all the latest news is explored?Contact us for helpPopularLatestCommentsTrump pardons two convicted by Russia investigationUSA23rd December 2020Kieran Trippier suspended for 10 weeks over breaches of betting rulesSports23rd December 2020The Papers: UK and EU on ‘verge’ of Brexit trade dealUK23rd December 2020Former BBC sports reporter Kevin Gearey diesEntertainment23rd December 2020Biden inauguration: New president to be sworn in amid Trump snubUSA20th January 2021Biden inauguration: Democrat to be sworn in as Trump leaves officeUSA20th January 2021Biden inauguration rehearsal paused amid US Capitol lockdownUSA18th January 2021Migrant caravan: Guatemala blocks thousands bound for USUSA18th January 2021Les Rehrer says:Hello Its me :P and thanks for this postoptumrx login says:Thank For News.Kent Laatsch says:Please let me know if you're looking for a writer…Bob says:RT News was where I learned that Erdogan controlled isis.…Copyright © 2018 Top News Theme.
