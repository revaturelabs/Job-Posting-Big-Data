Previous project|Next project ?1 of 81 of 8L'Oréal USA Hudson YardsNew York, New YorkL’Oréal’s new U.S. headquarters is a “House of Brands” spread over 10 floors in Manhattan’s new Hudson Yards development. The space reflects L’Oréal’s roots in innovation and improves collaboration among multiple divisions and more than 30 iconic beauty brands. To reinforce the connectivity of the new office, the design team devised a dramatic architectural statement by connecting the floors with two three-story staircases. Other aspects of the design responded to the highly specialized tasks undertaken at a cosmetics company, such as Virtual Reality Room where merchandising and marketing departments can simulate a real store setting. The office includes a number of employee perks such as a nail salon, company store, meditation and wellness rooms, café and juice bar, and a terrace.ExpertiseConsulting & Real Estate Services ?Interior Design ?Related ContentIn The MediaCNBCFrom virtual reality room to in-house salon, CNBC...In The MediaGlossyHow L'Oreal uses VR to make internal decisions at its...In The MediaD MagazineManno highlights \"workspaces that will give you office...In The MediaInterior DesignLutz discusses Gensler’s design for Coca Cola...Gensler Research InstituteU.S. Workplace Survey 2016Today’s organizations value Innovation, creativity and...Design forecast2017Our 2017 Design Forecast considers how design will...Dialogue ArticleRetail & Social MediaThe retail/virtual way people live is prompting a...ProjectNYX Cosmetics HeadquartersNYX Cosmetics, hip to trends in new media, is embracing...ShareTwitterFacebookLinkedInEmailContactGensler Fact SheetSite MapNewsletterDiversityTop of page© 2020 Gensler, All Rights Reserved Privacy Statement & Cookie Policy Transparency StatementPlease enable JavaScript to experience the full functionality of www.jobs63.com一本之道高清无码视频_韩国三级电影_香港三级韩国三级日本三级"
