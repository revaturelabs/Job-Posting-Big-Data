Why Lyft? * Boost Your Income : You get paid for the time and distance of a trip, plus tips and bonuses. * Be Your Own Boss : Set your own schedule and keep control over when you drive and earn. * Support the community: Lyft drivers are essential to our neighborhoods, communities, and cities. When you give rides, you're playing a vital role. How Lyft Driving Works * Step 1: Open the app and turn on driver mode * Step 2: Accept a passenger ride request * Step 3: Pick up your passenger at their location * Step 4: Drop off your passenger at their destination * *Once the ride has completed, payment is processed automatically and you're ready for your next ride! Driver Requirements * You're at least 25 years old * You have a 4-door from 2004 or newer * You own an iPhone or Android smartphone * You have a clean driving record and auto insurance * You consent to our driver screening and background checks This opportunity is for an independent contractor.
