Curse God and die!”2-10 In all this, Job did not sin with his lips.9-17 ” … He wounds me much for nothing.”27-2-6 “By God who has deprived me of justice! By Shaddai who has embittered mylife! As long as there is life in me, and God’s breath is in my nostrils, my lips will speakno wrong, nor my tongue utter deceit. Far be it from me to say you are right; until I dieI will maintain my integrity. I persist in my righteousness and will not yield; I shall befree of reproach as long as I live.”40-8 “Would you impugn my justice? Would you condemn me that you may be right?”* * * * * * * * *The assumption of a moral order, a system of retributive divine justice, leads to one oftwo errors-Error I- that suffering is a sign of sinOR (if it is not, then)Error 2- God is indifferent, wicked, unjust because he allows the innocent to sufferJob’s friends make error I – imputing sin where they see suffering. But Job is innocentand suffering “for nothing.” God affirms this when he says that the friends have lied andJob has spoken what is true.Job makes error 2 – impugns God’s character or justice because the innocent suffer andthe wicked prosper. But Job is equally mistaken.Both mistakes are avoided if the initial assumption – of a moral order, a system ofretributive divine justice – is abandoned. God is not a moral accountant. If he were thenit would be impossible ever to do the right thing for its own sake. Only when the hopefor just desserts is dead, can one act with full integrity, maintaining one’s righteousness.Copyright © 2007 Yale University. Some rights reserved.
