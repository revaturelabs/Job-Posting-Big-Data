It will take some time researching at the beginning, but will pay off in the long run.CVsA CV is a selling tool - used to sell you. It's your first chance to 'stand out' to an employer and make sure you get shortlisted.One size does not fit all when it comes to your CV - it should be an ever-changing document that is modified for each job you apply for, to ensure it is relevant. Although there are really important elements that must be included, this does mean you can highlight your best assets and achievements in the way you want to. Although CVs are still used for a lot of recruitment, many employers now have moved onto use application forms to assess candidates.Covering lettersA covering letter is traditionally a letter sent alongside your CV to an employer. It's your first point of contact with a potential employer, and what you say should make an impact and enable you to stand out from others.A covering letter is there to sell you to the employer - it needs to show clearly and succinctly why you want the job, what you have to offer and why the employer should read on.Application formsApplication forms and CVs are two totally different documents as application forms require you to enter certain information and failure to do so may mean you are not considered for the role, however it is you who decides what information you want to present on your CV.It is a well-known fact that application forms take time and there is no getting away from this! There are no hard and fast rules about how long you should spend completing an application form but the key is not to rush it and to make sure you are aware of the closing date as soon as you see the vacancy.Careers and employabilityStudents	Developing your skills and experiencePlanning your careerEquality, Diversity and InclusionInternational studentsOnline resourcesFinding a job	Applying for jobsRecruitment processStarting workPostgraduate studyGraduates and alumniEmployersStaffContact usCareers and employabilityStudents	Developing your skills and experiencePlanning your careerEquality, Diversity and InclusionInternational studentsOnline resourcesFinding a job	Applying for jobsRecruitment processStarting workPostgraduate studyGraduates and alumniEmployersStaffContact usCareers and employabilityStudents	Developing your skills and experiencePlanning your careerEquality, Diversity and InclusionInternational studentsOnline resourcesFinding a job	Applying for jobsRecruitment processStarting workPostgraduate studyGraduates and alumniEmployersStaffContact usSite menuHomeUndergraduate studyPostgraduate studyInternational studentsResearchAlumniCoursesNewsEventsFaculties and schoolsServices for businessGivingJobsAbout usHow to find usContact usSitemapAbout Kingston UniversityHomeContact usHow to find usPenrhyn RoadKingston HillKingston School of Art, Knights ParkRoehampton ValeSt George'sKingston School of Art, River HouseNewsNews articlesMedia enquiriesCoronavirus (Covid-19)Meeting the Covid-19 challengeEventsAll eventsMailing listAbout Kingston UniversityLocationHow the University worksCampus developmentRankingFacts and figuresEquality, diversity and inclusionSustainabilityStatement on modern slaveryIn the communitySupport departmentsCharitable statusOffice for Students registrationProcurementContact usFacultiesKingston School of ArtFaculty of Business and Social SciencesFaculty of Health, Social Care and EducationFaculty of Science, Engineering and ComputingJobsSearch for jobsApplicant adviceInterviews and offerJoining usStudy at Kingston UniversityCoursesUndergraduate coursesPostgraduate coursesFoundation coursesResearch degreesShort coursesTeacher trainingUndergraduate studyCoursesOrder a prospectusHow to applyInformation for applicantsWhy choose Kingston UniversityDisability and mental health supportAccommodationUndergraduate feesFees, funding and paymentsAccess, participation and inclusionPostgraduate studyCoursesApply nowFees and fundingAccommodationOpen EventsWork placementStudy resourcesStudent supportResearchCampusesChoose KingstonDisability and mental health supportPGCEInternational studentsWhy choose Kingston University?CoursesPre-sessional English courseStudying at KingstonDisability and mental health supportScholarships and feesCountry-specific informationAccommodationVisas, immigration and CASPre-arrival informationContact detailsResearch and enterpriseResearchAbout research at KingstonCoronavirusFacilitiesFestival of ResearchNews and eventsPolicies and guidesResearch and enterpriseResearch degreesResearch showcaseResearch Quality and the REFVacancies and studentshipsServices for businessWork with usTraining and professional developmentConsultancy and researchIntellectual Property and CommercialisationWork with our studentsDegree apprenticeshipsKnowledge exchangeKey partnerships and strategic relationshipsVenue and facilities hireFundingCase studiesNews and eventsAlumni and givingAlumniStay in touchNewsEventsGiving to KingstonGet involvedKUBackerOur alumniCareersGraduationCertificates, award documents and verificationsSpecial offers and shopContact usGiving to KingstonGiving to KingstonDonate onlineSupporting studentsInspire the future campaignSupporting Kingston JourneysWhy our donors giveThe Graduating Class GiftLegacy givingKU BackerDisclaimerCopyrightWebsite accessibilityWebsite feedbackFreedom of InformationWider Information SetPrivacy Notice and CookiesCharitable statusFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubePinterestLinkedInSnapchatKingston University, River House, 53–57 High Street, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey KT1 1LQ.
