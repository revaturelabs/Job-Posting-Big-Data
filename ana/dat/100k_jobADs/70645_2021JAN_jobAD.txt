The changes to the workforce will vary by country, based on local legal requirements and consultations with employee works councils and other employee representatives, as appropriate,” the company said.Challenging TimesHP split into the enterprise and cloud-focused HPE, and the hardware and personal computing business HP Inc last year. It was predicted that both companies would be able to operate more efficiently and effectively.Depending on how you look at it, the two businesses are either taking efficiency measures further or struggling to make the split work for them. HPE has been offloading its “non-core” software assets to Micro Focus, while HP Inc has seen a slump in profits despite strong laptop sales.“Our core markets are challenged and macro economic conditions are in flux right now,” said HP Inc chief executive Dion Weisler, appearing to point blame at the declining shipment of PCs in 2016.“Although our markets remain very challenged, we are committed to innovating in the core and continue to see long-term growth opportunities in commercial mobility and services, the disruption of the A3 copier market, and the digitisation of manufacturing though our leading 3D printing solutions.”Weisler’s confidence in growth opportunities seem to be backed-up by its recent acquisition of Samsung’s printer division for $1 billion.HP Inc could make a bit of a comeback towards the end of the year with the release of its MacBook Air-challenging Spectre 13 laptop, as well as its recent unveiling of laptops with built-in privacy screens designed to curtail snoopers in the physical world – something that’s likely to appeal to people working in sectors where privacy is paramount.Earlier this week, Fujitsu confirmed it was set to slash as many as 1,800 jobs in the UK, mainly in IT services. Separately, Fujitsu is aiming to offload its PC business, potentially to Lenovo, as previously reported.Read also :Cisco posts poor first quarter as staff cuts continueFujitsu confirms 1,800 UK jobs cull next yearCisco axes another 5,500 on the back of good profitsRecommend this article:0 0No CommentsHide CommentsCancel replyCommentName *Email *Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.cutsHPELayoffsPCsprinters﻿channelbizSubscribe to Channelbiz's newslettersSign upXBrand DiscoveryBrand Discovery offers Advertisers the opportunity to speak directly to our professional communities.
