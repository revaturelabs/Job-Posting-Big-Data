I am 59 years old, looking to get into teaching English, and naturally concerned that my age will count against me.Thailand requires foreign teachers to be less than 60 years old. Does Cambodia have a legal age limit?Back to topPattyFlipperJoined: 14 Nov 2007Posts: 572Posted: Thu Jun 25, 2015 1:59 am Post subject:No legal age limit, as yet, for obtaining the Ordinary Visa, and I know several people in their sixties and seventies who taught for Cambodian 'universities'. Things are however currently in a state of flux, with the requirement for a work permit now being actively enforced, and documentary evidence of employment or business activity sometimes being asked for before an Ordinary Visa will be issued on entry into the country.Changes are afoot, but nobody seems to have a very clear idea of what the new regulations are - including the various government departments tasked with their oversight.Back to topProf.GringoJoined: 07 Nov 2006Posts: 2236Location: Dang Cong San Viet Nam Quang Vinh Muon Nam!Posted: Fri Oct 16, 2015 9:34 am Post subject:kellrobinson wrote:I hope somebody comes along with good info.

I would be worried if you can:A- Find a jobB- Get paidC- Get paid enough to live onIf you have not taught before, you are looking at bleak prospects in SE Asia and basically, most of the world. Your age WILL count against you.Try China. The Land of Smog will have jobs aplenty for you.Oh wait, just saw you have been posting since 2012 and \"thinking\" about teaching EFL-Good to know.
