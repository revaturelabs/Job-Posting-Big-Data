A dedicated in- house resource team supports our consultants, allowing us to explore our markets discreetly, increasing our reach and generating wider networks every day.CLOSESpecialist PeopleWe have a carefully selected team of highly trained consultants who are specialists in their markets. Not only are they knowledgeable in our sectors, but they also build strong lasting relationships and understand the intricacies of their markets.CLOSEWe Are Also ResponsibleUnlike some of our competitors, we have a deep sense of responsibility to our clients and candidates and this is visible in our Values and behaviours. This sense also stretches to our local community as we support a charity each year, combining events, initiatives and sponsorships; currently, we are raising money for Greenback Yard.CLOSEPersonal RemunerationUnlike some competitors, we lack the bureaucratic restrictions of the PLC and the financial restrictions of less successful independents. This means we can be flexible about remuneration. And frankly, that flexibility means one thing: that if we think you have the values and and the skills to make a successful contribution, we also have the clout to make a compelling offer. Our salaries are motivating, our commission scheme compares favourably and our benefits include gym membership, healthcare cover, enhanced pension and car allowance options. In total, our financial rewards enhance the wider rewards of a long-term career with Henderson Brown.CLOSECareer ProgressionThis will be driven by your performance and your preference, alongside our preference to promote from within and a track record that demonstrates this vividly. We also have a transparent approach when it comes to organisation structure, performance expectations and promotion mechanisms (supported by a proper Appraisal Scheme that allows effective communication and objective-setting). There are no guarantees apart from one: given our continuing growth and our celebration of success for those both in Management and Fee Earning, there’ll be ample opportunities to build a satisfying career with a market-leading firm.CLOSEThorough TrainingUnlike many of our competitors, we’re not a “sink or swim” outfit. So please do one thing when we meet: compare the training and personal development offered by Henderson Brown with any other firm you’re considering. Because you may have seen that Fairness is one of our Values and this is reflected in the strong support we offer. Our Induction Training is tailored and comprehensive, combining classroom sessions, coaching on your desk and external courses. These are complemented by a training suite of topics that will accelerate your personal development, both from a general commercial and individual recruiter standpoint; we run weekly training sessions within and across our business (which are both lively and motivational); and there’s also the opportunity for regular coaching and counselling for you as an individual. We’ll certainly be pleased to discuss this with you, because at Henderson Brown, training’s a priority for our Leadership Team and a positive plus for you as you progress to become a specialist expert in your chosen field.CLOSEThe Right RoleAs a UK market leader, Henderson Brown has one advantage straight away: if you multiply the breadth of our functional sectors by our services across permanent, temporary and interim recruitment, we can find you the right career opportunity – one precisely fitting your appetites and abilities and ambitions.
