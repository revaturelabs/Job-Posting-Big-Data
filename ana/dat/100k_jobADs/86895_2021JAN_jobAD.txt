Our lab develops data-driven mathematical models as experimental frameworks for the strategic design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of public health programs to control infectious disease epidemics, including HIV/STI and more recently, COVID-19. We generate new, actionable knowledge in the service of infection prevention and care at a population-level. The research program is led by Dr. Sharmistha Mishra at St. Michael’s Hospital, and works closely with investigators, community-based organizations, and public health programs. Our lab members and collaborators are passionate about making a difference with their unique skills and perspectives within a diverse team, and are working together on what they love to do.We are recruiting for motivated quantitative epidemiologists with exceptional analytic, scientific writing, and organizational skills to lead observational epi and statistical modeling studies focused on predicting and evaluating the impact of interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in long-term care homes and among persons experiencing homelessness. The position may involve collaboration and engagement in projects related to HIV/STI epidemics. The position involves collaborating closely with implementation scientists, epidemiologists, statisticians, transmission modelers, health economists, clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, immunologists, virologists, public health teams, and with stakeholders and community partners. Specifically, the project involves working with surveillance, survey, cohort, spatial, serology, and intervention-specific data to lead statistical modeling and to support the parameterization of transmission models.Duties and Responsibilities:Lead observational epidemiology studies (including case-control and ecological studies) and statistical modeling (predictive and explanatory) and model validationDevelop and lead quantitative bias analysesDesign, develop, clean, and manage datasets of parameters and probability distributions for mathematical modelsFocused literature review and evidence syntheses for model parameterization and manuscript writingPrepare findings for publications, presentations, or reports (tailored to different audiences)Manuscript writing and editing for peer-reviewed publications as well as scientific and stakeholder presentationsSupport research processes (e.g., grant submission, research ethics review)Chair and lead project-specific meetings and communication with collaboratorsQualifications:A Master's degree in Epidemiology, Social Science, Biostatistics, Public Health, Health Economics, Economics, and/or related discipline – requiredMust be proficient in the use of at least one statistical language (R required; additional statistical language (SAS, Stata, Python, etc.) preferred) – requiredStrong analytical skills and an aptitude for accuracy, detail and problem-solving, with minimum 2 years experience in data management and statistical analysis – requiredPrior experience in cleaning raw data, exploratory data analyses - requiredPeer-reviewed publications and/or reports to policy-makers, non-governmental agencies, etc. as first author or co-author (submitted publications acceptable) – requiredExperience with causal inference, multi-level models, and Bayesian statistics – preferredCoursework or experience working or collaborating with transmission dynamics models – preferredPrior experience working on COVID-19 or infectious disease related research – preferredDemonstrate deep understanding of various sources of biases in dataExcellent verbal communication skillsExcellent written communication / documentation of code (analyses)Work both independently (lead projects) and as part of a team in a collaborative and interdisciplinary research environmentMotivated, self-starting, with strong time management and project coordinationAbility to multi-task and prioritize tasks, work accurately and effectively with deadlinesRelevant SMH/LKSKI Websites:Lab Website: https://mishra-lab.caCOVID-19 Modeling Website: https://github.com/mishra-lab?q=covidMAP C-UHS: https://maphealth.ca/Sharmistha Mishra: http://stmichaelshospitalresearch.ca/researchers/sharmistha-mishra/TypeOtherInstitutionSt. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health TorontoCityTorontoCountryCanadaClosing dateFebruary 5th, 2021Posted onJanuary 4th, 2021 17:27Last updatedJanuary 12th, 2021 20:27ShareTweet"
