Claims are off their peak of 6.9 million in late March but remain well above the pre-pandemic record.Continuing claims also fell sharply, dropping 569,000 to 5.52 million.The claims data comes a day before the Labor Department releases its closely watched nonfarm payrolls report for November. Dow Jones estimates are for payroll growth of 440,000 and a decrease in the unemployment rate to 6.7%.The report is also the first since the Government Accountability Office said the weekly jobless claims figures have been inaccurate during the pandemic. The watchdog agency cited uncounted case backlogs and fraud and other discrepancies at the state level as obstacles to providing an accurate count.The GAO recommended that the Labor Department issue a disclaimer about the potential inaccuracy of the count, but none was included in this report.“The plunge in initial claims does not refute the idea that the trend is rising; we expected a sharp fall because of the difficulty of adjusting for Thanksgiving,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note. “Initial claims likely will rebound strongly next week, probably rising above the 800K mark for the first time in eight weeks.”Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims actually dropped for the week, falling by more than 30,000 to 288,701. The program provides benefits to those not normally eligible prior to the pandemic.However, filings continued to rise for the emergency pandemic program, which addresses those who have lost their normal benefits. That total increased nearly 60,000 to 4.57 million for the week ended Nov. 14, the most recent period for which data is available.In all, 20.16 million Americans were receiving some kind of benefits, a decrease of 349,633 from the previous period, according to data also through Nov. 14. That compares with 1.57 million a year ago.At the state level, California (-38,522), Texas (-15,726) and Michigan (-12,448) reported the biggest drops, according to unadjusted data. Claims rose in Illinois (8,543) and Oregon (5,483).Source:Share0previous postEmergency services rush to large explosion at warehouse near Bristolnext postSurviving Covid viewers were left ‘heartbroken’ after man, 62, lost his battle with coronavirusInterNewsCastLatest breaking news and Top stories around the globe at your disposal 24/7Related postsElectoral College 2020: Biden Wins Michigan, One State Away From VictoryInterNewsCast 5th November 2020American investors could pay the price as the U.S. moves to blacklist more Chinese firmsInterNewsCast 1st December 2020Malan revels in his player of the match display for England in T20 series victory over South AfricaInterNewsCast 29th November 2020Biden Energy secretary pick Jennifer Granholm has past ties to utilities, chemical companiesInterNewsCast 17th December 2020Why Dufry’s Fourth Retail Contract In Turkey Could Prove To Be A Valuable AssetInterNewsCast 17th September 2020Luke Voit Hopes DJ LeMahieu Stays With The New York Yankees And Sees Name Mentioned In Trade RumorsInterNewsCast 10th December 2020Click to commentLeave a Comment Cancel ReplySave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.Most ReadIndiana Jones Is Getting A Brand New Story And Fans Should Get Very ExcitedInterNewsCast 12th January 202112th January 2021 34Hair loss treatment: Caffeine shown to stimulate male hair follicles by blocking mechanismInterNewsCast 11th January 202111th January 2021 37Ray Parlour says Arsenal attacker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is ‘easy for defenders to mark’InterNewsCast 15th January 202115th January 2021 12Can I meet my friends outside?
