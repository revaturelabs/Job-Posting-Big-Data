From our first date to getting our driving licenses, we were forming the people we have grown into being now. One of the biggest factors in your high school learning experience went a lot further out of the classroom than many educators would want you to believe.Your first job gave you the work ethic and the life skills that you needed to become an adult! After you tell us about the work that you did and the working hours that occupied your teenage life, we think we can accurately guess which job you held over the summer. High schoolers work in a lot of different industries, but we are sure your answers will lead us directly to the job you called your first one.When you see our questions, think back to all those hours you spent working at a job where you cut your workforce teeth. Then, choose the response that is closest to your high school reality. Once you share your experiences with us, we will know if you worked in a restaurant or at the mall.
