That’s just below July’s revised all-time high of 6 million job openings.Although job opening growth cooled slightly compared to 2018 — and pay growth remains stubbornly low, holding steady at 1.9 percent — August figures ultimately showed the labor market continues to expand at a moderate pace that’s fundamentally healthy.Americans mostly dismissed recession fears, remaining confident in the state of the economy, with consumer sentiment near generational highs. That’s helping to boost industries like retail, restaurant and bars, and beauty and fitness.Take a closer look at the U.S. cities experiencing the fastest-growing job growth pace.Boston: Jobs expanded by 8.5 percent in Boston, the fastest pace of any U.S. city. In part, that’s because Boston benefits from a diversified labor market: It has high-skilled industries like technology, as well as white-collar industries like accounting and legal and consulting. Boston has more than 155,400 open jobs.Philadelphia: Philadelphia followed Boston, in terms of fastest-growing job growth. Job openings grew by 5.8 percent, year-over-year, in August, with a median base pay of $56,972. There are more than 111,000 jobs in Philadelphia, Glassdoor data found.Atlanta, Georgia, USA downtown city skyline.Atlanta: With a 5.5 percent pace of job opening growth, Atlanta slightly trailed Philadelphia. The Georgia capital, however, has slightly more available jobs: 122,350. Those jobs have a median base pay of $55,782.Birds eye view of the West Facade of the U.S. Capitol Building and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC.Washington, D.C. Job openings grew at a 4.9 percent in Washington, D.C., with more than 190,500 available positions. Those jobs have a median income of $61,956.Seattle downtown and Space Needle view, Washington, USASeattle: Seattle trailed in fifth, with job openings increasing at a 4.3 percent rate year-over-year. In total, the city that birthed Amazon and Microsoft has more than 112,900 available jobs, with a median income of $63,633.MORE FROM FOXBUSINESS.COM…CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSSource: Fox BusinessSubscribe to Equity ExtraRecieve the Latest Updates on Breakout StocksSubscribe to Equity News Report’s ‘Equity Extra’ Alerts list to be the first to learn about Premium Nasdaq Stocks before they BreakoutShare:Previous ArticleTrump touts border wall progress as Pentagon ...Next ArticleEditorRelated articlesUS Top News & AnalysisCoronavirus live updates: China says risk of local outbreak hasn’t gone away, South Korea reports 9 deathsMarch 24, 2020Politics, U.S.ATrump slams lack of media coverage of Hunter BidenDecember 11, 2020Economy, U.S.AUS existing home sales fall sharply to 3-year lowFebruary 21, 2019US Top News & AnalysisAmazon is descending on New York with another one of its cashier-free storesJune 11, 2019Leave a reply Cancel replyPolitics, U.S.APompeo warns of Chinese threat to US colleges, says many ‘basically bought’ by BeijingDecember 9, 2020EquityExtraTechnical Communications Corporation Gives An Update On Its Listing Requirements.
