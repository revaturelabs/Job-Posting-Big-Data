It's a full-time delivery job. I will get $600-$750 a week for it. Of course I have to pay my own mileage, insurances, and I have to do taxes differently.I currently work a W2 job at $11 per hour and I get about $550 bi-weekly, but that's after taxes and my health insurance comes out.I read about the differences between the W2 and 1099, but I don't have a clue as to how taxes are done for a 1099, and I don't know how much of my money will need to go towards taxes. Basically, all things considered, is the 1099 job going to pay me a lot more in the end?>>Anonymous 2017-02-18 12:14:44 Post No.18058874[Report]Anonymous 2017-02-18 12:14:44 Post No.18058874 [Report]1099 is so an employer can put the tax costs on you. It's also illegal to be 1099 if you are full time. Just imagine a few thousand out of your paycheck gone when tax time comes.>>Anonymous 2017-02-18 12:18:28 Post No.18058879[Report]Anonymous 2017-02-18 12:18:28 Post No.18058879 [Report]>>18058874To be more clear take about 20% of every pay check and that is the minimum you have to pay. You will also have to start keeping track of expenses like miles driven for work and money spent on work materials. That will help a bit but really it's chunk change.>>Anonymous 2017-02-18 12:48:58 Post No.18058943[Report]Anonymous 2017-02-18 12:48:58 Post No.18058943 [Report]>>18058591You owe the IRS about $4k when you do taxes.>>Anonymous 2017-02-18 02:08:58 Post No.18059111[Report] Image search: [iqdb] [SauceNao] [Google]Anonymous 2017-02-18 02:08:58 Post No.18059111 [Report]File: 10408547_1453284841614152_9091350715790570309_n.jpg (39KB, 797x960px) Image search: [iqdb] [SauceNao] [Google]39KB, 797x960pxThank you guys for the input.Thread posts: 5Thread images: 2[Boards: 3 / a / aco / adv / an / asp / b / bant / biz / c / can / cgl / ck / cm / co / cock / d / diy / e / fa / fap / fit / fitlit / g / gd / gif / h / hc / his / hm / hr / i / ic / int / jp / k / lgbt / lit / m / mlp / mlpol / mo / mtv / mu / n / news / o / out / outsoc / p / po / pol / qa / qst / r / r9k / s / s4s / sci / soc / sp / spa / t / tg / toy / trash / trv / tv / u / v / vg / vint / vip / vp / vr / w / wg / wsg / wsr / x / y] [Search | Top | Home]Please support this website by donating Bitcoins to 16mKtbZiwW52BLkibtCr8jUg2KVUMTxVQ5If a post contains copyrighted or illegal content, please click on that post's [Report] button and fill out a post removal requestAll trademarks and copyrights on this page are owned by their respective parties.
