Clay, metal, woodcarving and mould-making kits, stacked on pallets for easy delivery, sit alongside custom-built worktables that students can drill and hammer on.Students have been really excited to get their materials.“It feels like Christmas,” Laverdière says. “Everything was a bit blurred before, so getting a pack of clay, getting different colours, getting tools, really makes it more real and ready to get your hands working with the materials.”For Ortiz-Apuy, the kits are an expression of the collective resourcefulness that the pandemic has brought out among the faculty, staff and students in the fine arts. Since March, he’s seen many other examples sprouting from Concordia’s arts community.“For some students, that has meant banding together to rent a studio. For others it has been about repurposing materials or making public installations on their balconies and windows. It’s all about creative problem-solving during the pandemic.”Find out more about Concordia’s Faculty of Fine Arts.Source link← Most employers in Taiwan plan to hire new workers in Q4: pollBringing patient engagement in healthcare to the next level with print and digital marketing – Southernminn.com →Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
