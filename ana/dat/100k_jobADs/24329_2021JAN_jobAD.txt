The sector represents about 331,000 jobs in everything from auto manufacturing to sales and service.Print this pageTweetRelatedMust Be Election Time in OntarioOntario Government Announces New FundingToyota Lexus Plant In Cambridge, Ontario Gets $34 Million From Ottawa And Ontario: Canadian PressNew Toyota Plant Opens in Woodstock, OntarioHave your say: Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
