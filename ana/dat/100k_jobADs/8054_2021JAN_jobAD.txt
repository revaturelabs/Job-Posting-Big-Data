I will provide you with all images, you just need them to combine and work together. My website designer has also given me the dimensions to work to for the images.If you need an example click below:Combine one of these images:http://www.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&q=epc&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1259&bih=823with one of these images:http://www.google.co.uk/images?um=1&hl=en&biw=1259&bih=823&tbs=isch%3A1&sa=1&q=paypal&aq=f&aqi=g10&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=However, please understand that the above links are just examples so you know what to expect.
