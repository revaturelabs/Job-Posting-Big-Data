I don't think he has the competence to carry out the job.\"\"There really isn't any guiding principle that I was able to discern other than what's good for Donald Trump's re-election,\" he said.Bolton's book on his time in the White House, which is set for release June 23, alleges the president s consumed with re-election concerns and calls the president's foreign policy \"erratic,\" according to excerpts reported by media outlets.\"I think he was so focused on re-election that longer-term consideration fell by the wayside,\" Bolton said to ABC News of Trump's approach to foreign policy.Bolton called himself \"sick at heart over Trump's zeal to meet with (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un.\"\"There was considerable emphasis on the photo opportunity and the press reaction to it and little or no focus on what such meetings did for the bargaining position of the United States,\" Bolton said.In \"The Room Where it Happened: A White House Memoir,\" Bolton writes that Trump asked China's President Xi Jinping to increase the country's purchase of American-grown farm products because aiding farmers would help him in the presidential race, according to an excerpt in the Wall Street Journal.
