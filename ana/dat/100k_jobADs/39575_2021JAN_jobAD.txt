Plenty of IT graduate schemes exist, either with technology companies or with employers in other sectors that hire people into IT functions (such as retail, banking and local or national government). However, many graduates find their first IT or technology job at a smaller organisation that may not run a structured training programme – this can mean more variety and responsibility early on.Find out how to get a graduate IT job at a smaller company.Read our advice on working out what type of employer and role would suit you.IT application advice: online application forms, CVs and covering lettersBefore you put pen to paper or start typing, make sure you know what the employer does, who its competitors are and what you are applying for.
