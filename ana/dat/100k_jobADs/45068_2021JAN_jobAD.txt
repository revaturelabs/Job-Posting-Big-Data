The weather has cooled down so you can do yard work comfortably and get ready for a lot of time inside this winter.However, you may be temped to wait until November to start getting ready. We're here to tell you that there's a lot you need to consider before you hibernate for winter. If you don't get these four jobs done, you risk having to do extra spring cleaning next year.1) Roof repairMaybe you'll do this yourself, or maybe you'll hire a contractor, but don't delay repairing your roof if you think there's a leak. Look out for any loose tiles or shingle that needs replacing. You won't want to get up there if there's snow around, and your house will need all the protection it can get during the winter.Leaks can cause damage during the rainy fall and winter when snow falls and melts. There are many great contractors that offer leak repair, so don't delay in soliciting their services.2) Clear Out The GuttersYour gutters shouldn't accumulate too many leaves, branches and twigs during summer. However, they certainly will get congested during fall. As trees begin to shed their leaves throughout this season, your gutters are likely to get increasingly backed up; and they will come under greater strain during this rainier season.Ideally, it is best to get on top of cleaning your gutters as soon as the leaves come down. Regularly tending to your gutters during fall will stop the gutters from getting backed up before winter. Clearing out gutters is a horrible job in the freezing cold, and it may not be feasible if you live in a particularly snowy state.Indeed, if you don't get to your gutters during the fall, the snow and cold of winter is likely to compound whatever is going on in your gutters. This will make it harder to clean them out when spring rolls around. You may also encounter drainage problems at the back end of fall and during winter.Clear your gutters out now for peace of mind in winter.3) Sort The GarageWho wants to sort the garage out during summer? Very few of us. It doesn't take long to overheat in there, sorting out years of clutter the family has accumulated, old bikes and unused tools.Fall is certainly the time to get into the garage, a task that will be off the cards during the winter.Fall is also a great time to do this as it tends to be a popular season for yard sales. That means you can get rid of a lot of the stuff you no longer want. If you can organize something together with your neighbors, you might generate more interest and attract more people to look around.4) Brush Up The LeavesOne of the things we love best about fall is the color of the trees as leaves change to beautiful reds and golds. One of the things we like the least is clearing up the leaves on the lawn.While this is a tedious job, it has to be done. When winter hits, the piles of crisp leaves become soggy, amorphous blobs — particularly after the snow melts. Make this job easier for yourself by doing it early during fall.Bottom LineIt's tempting to sit on the couch and watch the game every weekend, but getting up early and taking care of these duties will leave you feeling more relaxed; you'll be at ease knowing you won't have to deal with any of these tedious tasks during the winter and spring!Filed Under: Home Maintenance & ImprovementPrimary SidebarSearch for SomethingSearch this websiteSince 2001 Prim Mart has been the place for those who enjoy the country life.
