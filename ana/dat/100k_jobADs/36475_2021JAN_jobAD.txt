Then He Graduated First In His Class & A Job At BCGby: Stacy Blackman, founder of Stacy Blackman Consulting on August 11, 2018 | 2 Comments Comments 12,733 ViewsAugust 11, 2018After 19 rejections in a row, Ed Luggen got into Emory University’s Goizueta School of Business and graduated top of class“I wrote 24 applications over two years and was turned down nineteen times in a row before anyone said yes, and all said-and-done I received only two “yesses.” Hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars I spent trying to get in, and was rejected over and over,” shares Ed Luggen.When Luggen signed up with an MBA admissions consulting firm, Stacy Blackman Consulting in 2015, he had received more rejections than almost anyone we had ever worked with.
