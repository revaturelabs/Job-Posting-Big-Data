This seemingly innocent and obvious question sinks more interviews than any other part of the interview. Everyone knows this question is coming, however, very few candidates prepare for this. They assume that they know their background, and so they can just talk about it. However 90% of candidates talk themselves right out of a job just in telling about themselves. Because they have not prepared they:RambleBore the InterviewerSay irrelevant or even damaging thingsDo not demonstrate relevancy to the company or the positionDo not demonstrate track record of successNailing this part of the interview makes the rest of the interview so much easier. If you strike out on this, recovering is almost impossible. Since you know they are going to ask the question, wouldn’t it make sense to prepare? I have heard recommendations to respond by asking the interviewer to first explain what the job entails. If I am interviewing, and a candidate asks this question, I will wonder why they did not read the job description, and assume they are unprepared. So how do you answer this question? Keep in mind, when interviewing, your primary objectives are to:Answer “What is in it for the interviewer”?Demonstrate how your values and culture align with the company values and culture.Articulate what you are known for, and how that is a benefit for the company.Articulate your value proposition.Also you need to be concise and to the point. In preparing for the “Tell Me About Yourself” the following tips will help you nail the shot when the game is on the line.Read and understand the job description.Research the company.Total time should be between 1½ and 3 minutes.Give a BRIEF synopsis of your career. Shape your synopsis to the needs learned from the job description and prior research.Do not list every title and company you have worked for, but give a range.Do not give a laundry list of responsibilities tasks or processes you performed, but give a range.Based on the job description, as well as the required skills and experiences, give 2 or 3 SHORT accomplishment statements to demonstrate your success.Do not go into details.Do not take time to “set the stage”.Give a simple Quantified Result and action statement including key skill or experience.Should be 20 words or less.Summarize skills and experience inferred from the accomplishment statements focusing on skills and experiences required in the job description.Say why you want the job! Why are you interested in the company, and their products or services?Solicit their agreement that your background and experience enable you to meet the objectives of the position and the company.I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on the interview “Tell Me About Yourself” and how you prepare.Like this:LikeBe the first to like this.Feel free to share this informationFacebookLinkedInTwitterRedditPinterestPrintEmailLike this:Like Loading...RelatedThis entry was posted in Job Interviews, Job Search by Rosemary Cardno.
