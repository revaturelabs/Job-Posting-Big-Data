While not all companies have the budget for luxurious office spaces, free meals and other perks, there are some unconventional ways you can change your workspace if you are trying to figure out how to keep a positive work environment for you and your employees. Here are a couple of ideas you can consider.Make Schedules that Fit the WorkloadFor most workers, a 9-to-5 job is common. For many industries, there are 60- and 90-hour weeks on a regular basis. But what if your schedules fit the workload, and not a specific set of hours? Many employees will find more time for productivity and less time for other busy work if they know they can have an afternoon off when a project has been completed. Not all businesses can work this way, but many can try it out.Encourage DistractionsMany bosses want to limit the distractions their employees face, but a new trend in office spaces is providing things such as games, comfortable seating areas to chat and other distractions from work. When utilized properly, employees have a bit of fun to break up the stress of the day, and when they go back to work they can focus better on the task at hand.Consider PetsAnother trend in a wide range of work spaces is bringing dogs or cats to the office. As long as the pets are well-behaved, many employees find the comfort of having pets around help to calm the office and relieve stress. If you own a business where clients visit the office, this can also show them that you are a company that has a bit of fun, even when the work is serious business.If you are interested in learning more about positive work environments and how you can achieve it for your own business, please contact us.Share this:EmailTweetShare on TumblrPocketPrintLike this:Like Loading...RelatedBookmark the permalink.Post navigationPrevious post ← Good News for HVAC Jobs in 2014Next post Three Easy Ways to Attract New Customers →Employer Login:HVAC AgentPlumbing AgentElectrical AgentJob Seeker Login:HVAC AgentPlumbing AgentElectrical AgentFollow Blog via EmailEnter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.Email Address:	FollowLike us on FacebookHVAC AgentPlumbing AgentElectrical AgentFollow us on TwitterHVAC AgentPlumbing AgentElectrical AgentCategoriesElectrical AgentHvac AgentLLCMonthly Housing Starts & Permit StatsMy Open JobsMy Open Jobs, LLCPlumbing AgentRecruiting BytesPhoneDallas, TX1-800-396-4822M-F 8-5Blog at WordPress.com.Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email AddressCancelPost was not sent - check your email addresses!
