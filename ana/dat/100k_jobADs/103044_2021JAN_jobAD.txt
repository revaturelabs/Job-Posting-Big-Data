Hire yourself and start calling the shots.Get Started FreeDifferent Types of Remote Jobs1. DeveloperIf you can do one type of job online, it’s those in the development sphere. Whether you’re an engineer, games developer, app developer, full-stack developer – or anything in between – these can all be remote jobs.Not only are developer roles frequently remote, but there’s also massive demand for these positions making these roles top remote jobs. Because of this, remote jobs in the development realm don’t mean working for lesser-known companies or taking a pay cut. In fact, it might mean the opposite.The tech industry is only going to grow, and there’s only going to be more demand for developers and engineers. If you’re not already a developer, there are a lot of free resources available that will help you build your skills for free. From there, you can jump into an internship or junior developer role and work your way up.2. TranslatorWith the internet connecting us all, the demand for translators has only increased, with businesses eager to bridge the communication gap. A translator can work a variety of different roles, such as working testing websites, translating documents, or proofreading.Obviously, this is a remote job that requires you to have very high language skills in at least two languages. And if you are proficient in multiple languages, this would give you more scope. However, if you do happen to be at least bilingual, then these translation remotes jobs may suit you.3. DesignerAnother job in the tech industry, designers have a sought after skillset that many remote companies want. Remote graphic design jobs, as well as WordPress theme design, UX and UI design roles, are all able to be done while working remotely.Design roles require a lot of knowledge, but much like developers, you can learn many of these skills with the help of free tools. These days, a lot of value is placed on a well-designed website – and deservedly so. What this means is that companies will always need designers, making it a solid career choice. If you’re considering remote jobs, this alone is a strong case for working as a designer.4. Journalist/WriterWorking as a journalist in the internet age isn’t as easy as it once was due to the closure of many papers. But with that said, it is still a popular work from home job.As far as remote jobs are concerned, journalism requires you to have exceptional research skills and be a well-developed writer. However, if you’re not quite at that stage, you could also start writing content for different types of online websites. Doing this would help you improve your writing and enable you to start a portfolio of your work.5. EntrepreneurThis is a slightly different remote job as it requires you to work for yourself, rather than a company. But, if you’ve been searching for remote jobs and nothing seems to fit, perhaps the answer is to start something yourself.Being an entrepreneur is not for the faint of heart. And it’s not one of those 9-5 remote jobs. But it can be massively rewarding. Entrepreneurs are driven to succeed by belief in their business and will grind to make it a success. Starting your own business will teach you a variety of skills you don’t yet have – and sharpen the ones you do have.Remote Marketing Jobs6. Social Media ManagerIf you’re searching for remote marketing jobs that will allow you to utilize all your social media skills (a.k.a endless scrolling on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram), then you should look into social media manager roles.A social media manager position can easily be done from home as you communicate with your team via chat or email, and schedule your posts using online tools. Having an excellent grasp of the different social media platforms and what content does or doesn’t work is a must. However, you can build these skills over time. Start out by helping a small company and then use that experience to gain work with bigger businesses.7. Online MarketerCould you sell ice to a polar bear? If you answered yes, perhaps an online marketer role is the one for you. Online Marketing a catch-all term for many different skills that come under the marketing umbrella. Some of the different areas of expertise include working in search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), affiliate marketing, content marketing, or email marketing.Remote marketing jobs are becoming easier to come by, especially as marketing roles generally require very little specialist equipment. Because there are so many different areas of marketing, there are plenty of opportunities for you to refine your skills in one area and look for remote jobs in that space.Part-time Remote Jobs8. Virtual AssistantReady to help entrepreneurs and businesses get organized? Becoming a virtual assistant is a role that does just that. This is one of those remote jobs that helps alleviate some of the pressures on others by taking on simple but time-consuming tasks.A virtual assistant may perform customer service duties or fulfill orders for online stores. They might also make small updates and changes to websites, or handle calendars. To be a virtual assistant, you need to be responsible, organized and have excellent communication skills. Virtual assistant roles aren’t necessarily full time, which leaves a lot of flexibility. If you have time constraints, being a virtual assistant one of the best part-time remote jobs.9. Customer SupportIf you’ve got a way with people and love working to solve problems, a customer support role is one of the remote jobs that would suit you. Working in this role requires you to use call or chat software to help answer customer questions and solve problems.To excel in this role, you need to have fantastic communication skills and be able to quickly learn about the product or service you will be helping customers with. While some customer support roles are full-time positions, others may be part-time, or weekend or evening work. This makes it easy to work around other commitments you may have.10. TranscriberIf you’re considering part-time remote jobs and have fantastic attention to detail and listening skills, add transcriber to your list. A transcriber works to convert audio files into written text. It’s a service used by many different industries, from medical professionals to podcasters – and lots in between.Transcription work requires you to master the ability to listen and type at the same time simultaneously. Although it sounds straightforward, that doesn’t mean transcription is the easiest of all work from home jobs. However, there is a lot of demand for it. And, over the next few years, there will likely only be more demand for transcribers, making it one of the more stable part-time remote jobs.11. English TeacherTeaching English overseas is already a very common job for travelers, but you may not know that teaching also makes the list of remote jobs. With the help of a stable internet connection and a headset, you can easily become an online tutor and help students with their language skills.English teachers are always in demand, but there’s also a need for many different languages.

Take a look at these five tricks for some easy ways to make your remote working experience an enjoyable one.Have a RoutineA daily routine gets you out of home mode and into work mode. Your routine could be as simple as establishing a hard start and finish times, or a little more elaborate. For example, you could incorporate a morning “commute” around the block for some fresh air and mental preparation before you start your day.Try and Work Regular HoursWe touched on this above, but sticking to regular work hours will help you mentally get in the right mind space for work. For many remote jobs, you may be working a regular eight hour day, so this could be easy to accomplish. However, for jobs with hours that are more freeform, try at least to set up blocks of regular dedicated work time. Don’t fall into the trap of consistently working late – a work/life balance is important.Have Scheduled BreaksYes, amongst all that working, it’s essential to take breaks to recharge as well. It’s hard to do your best work when you’re feeling burnt out, so taking your full scheduled breaks is incredibly important for productivity. Sometimes distracting yourself with something as simple as brewing a cup of coffee will be enough to reset your brain and leave you refreshed to continue your day.Have a Dedicated Work AreaWorking from the couch might seem like a dream, but there’s something to be said for being able to physically leave your work area at the end of the day. If you’re considering a remote job, setting up a dedicated work space will help keep your work and leisure separate. Create an area that’s very clearly for work time – perhaps include a desk, supportive chair, and office supplies – this will make that couch time all the more relaxing.Get Fresh AirIf you’re working a remote job, it can be incredibly easy to get to the end of the day and realize you haven’t been outside at all. But, just because it’s easy to do, doesn’t mean it’s good for you! Making sure you get some fresh air, and a change of scenery will do wonders for your mind. And if it’s sunny, you’ll also get to soak up all that beautiful vitamin D from its rays.Want to Learn More?Work From Home Jobs: A Great Solution for Stay-at-Home ParentsCreating a Home Office Designed for Maximum AchievementHow to Sell Products from Home10 Remote Work Statistics That You Need to Know in 2021RelatedWork From Home Jobs: A Great Solution for Stay-at-Home ParentsAfter having children, priorities change as you figure out how your new addition fits into your life.
