Is it because they follow a secret recipe to retain top talent - or is it because they are aware of different ways to identify quality talent right at the beginning? The answer is tricky. But experts across the world believe that employee-retention is always the second step - first step is to attract the right talent. While companies like these continuously share positive hiring outlook, others complain about recruitment challenges. New-age recruiters or HR specialists across the globe are facing some serious roadblocks in terms of hiring relevant candidates - as a result not been able to retain them for a longer span.One recruitment challenge which stands out is around identifying authentic avenues to tap good quality talent. While a large number of recruiters rely on social media to attract/ engage potential employees, others complain about having a lesser scope of talent assessment on these platforms. \"A lot of things that are portrayed by an individual in a digital space are not true. Profiles/ resumes which come across as a 120% match with the job profile, often turns out to be a 2% match only when the recruiter actually goes ahead and interviews the candidate,\" says Renuka Krishna, AVP-HR, KPIT Cummins.According to industry experts, social media can be used as an 'engagement' tool and not for recruiting or assessment purpose always. Information posted on these forums can be discounted as people tend to put up personal updates without keeping in mind that an employer can actually be going through his profile and assessing him for a given job role.While talking about talent assessment, it will be wise not to fully depend on an individual's recommendation posts or referrals on these platforms. \"Someone who doesn't know you well but recommending you is not relevant for applicant screening purpose. But, if your immediate boss is putting a recommendation then it becomes relevant,\" says Farzana Adenwalla, Head HR, Omnitech InfoSolutions Ltd.Another challenge which is worth mentioning is around creating a healthy talent pipeline. Companies whose HR managers solely rely on unconventional means of recruitment are often overwhelmed when they need to create a steady flow of quality talent throughout the year. A recruitment tool that is dedicated to attracting only industry specific candidates, on the other hand, will go a long way in creating the relevant talent pipeline. Not only will it be able to attract talent for a present job opening, but also create a database for future openings as well.Also, it is important that HR sets up recruitment goals and have a clear understanding of the hiring requirements. Only then will they be able to leverage these options to the fullest. In order to avoid some of the ongoing challenges, following are some of the questions that recruiters need to ask before commencing the recruitment process:- What type of candidates do we need to target?- Kind of recruitment message to be communicated- How can the candidates be reached in an efficient way?- What should a job description entail?- What kind of skill sets are the recruiters looking for?- Are the recruiters reaching out to well-qualified passive candidates?According to experts, while it may be a good idea to engage individuals through social media platforms, recruiters should use tools that give them access to relevant candidates and put them in touch with passive but critical talent in their industry.Add Comment()Comments ()Characters Remaining: 3000SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmailOR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATIONXSort By: NewestOldestDiscussedUp VotedDown VotedBe the first one to comment.We have sent you a verification email.
