This is great news for people who hate working from 9 to 5 in an office cubicle.So, where do you find real legitimate work at home jobs online and how do you actually land a high paying job working from home?Advantages & Disadvantages Of Work From Home JobsHaving been working at home for the past 3 years, I can tell you that there are certainly a lot of advantages of being able to work online from just a laptop at home, but there are some downsides as well.Advantages Of Working At HomeYou don’t need to wake up at 7 am every morning just to rush to work.No more squeezing with so many people on the train during morning peak hours.No more eating the grab-and-go breakfast at your desk.Finally, you can now take your time to make a healthy breakfast for yourself to start your day off.Also, you can say Goodbye to Monday blues.More importantly, you no longer have to end your Sunday night early because you don’t need to rush to the office the next morning.And if you are a parent to young children, you will really appreciate the flexibility in your schedule and the fact that you can work from home.Disadvantages Of Working At HomeWhen you are working from home, you might feel lonely and bored because there isn’t much human interaction at home.If you are an extrovert and love to work around other people, then you would not like the idea of working at home by yourself every single day.Also, there is no one to supervise and manage you at home, so you’ll need to have the self-discipline to stay productive and get work done on time.If you want legit, quick and easy ways to earn extra cash online, you can try the following:Inbox Dollars (Claim your FREE $5 now)Pinecone Research (Minimum $3 per survey)Swagbucks (Over 400 million dollars paid out)Who Work At Home Jobs Are Suitable ForWork from home jobs are most suitable for people who really need the flexibility in schedule.If you find yourself in the following situations, then you probably want to explore working from home online job opportunities:You have children or loved ones whom you need to stay at home to take care ofYou are studying in college and you want to make money in your spare timeYou want to travel and explore the world while still getting paid from your online jobsYou have chronic physical or mental illness and the home work environment helps you manage your conditions betterYou are retired but you still want to work for extra income or just pass time at homeYou are a super commuter and you want to make use of your commute time to earn extra money onlineFurther Reading:A Beginner’s Guide: How You Can Make A Full-Time Income Online (2020)Types of Jobs You Can Do From HomeThere are many different types of home-based jobs, depending on how you categorize them.For example, you can group them by industry or profession or even earning potential.But, I prefer to classify them into three main groups:Type #1: You Get Employed By Companies To Work From HomeType #2: You Can Offer Services From Home As A Freelancer Or Service Business OwnerType #3: You Can Start A Blog & Selling Your Knowledge OnlineWhat Are Best Work From Home Jobs For YOUThere are a few important questions you need to ask yourself when it comes to deciding which work from home jobs are best for you.Question #1: What kind of schedule are you looking for?Are you looking for part-time or full-time work at home jobs?Do you want a flexible schedule or a fixed schedule?Do you want to work only in the short term or you want to do it for the long term?For example, there are customer service jobs that allow you to work from home full-time with a fixed schedule. (See the example below)Also, there are freelance writers who work for different clients remotely and can set their own schedule.(Side note: I highly recommend this freelance writing course Write to 1K if you are interested in exploring freelance writing)(See example below)Further Reading:How To Make An Extra $1,000 Per Month (Consistently)Question #2: What kind of work from home job types are you looking for?Do you want to work as an employee for a company and receive all the employee benefits?Or do you want to employ yourself?Some companies prefer to hire freelancers or agencies to work remotely with them while other companies choose to employ a full-time or part-time worker to work from home.So, which one do you choose?If you choose to work from home for a company as a full-time employee, there are obvious advantages.First of all, you get the company benefits such as insurance and dental.Secondly, your income is stable, and you don’t need to worry about getting work or clients every month.However, the downside is that you cannot choose whom you want to work with or what projects you want to work on.On top of that, you still have a boss you have to answer to.If you choose to work for yourself from home either selling services online or blogging, the good thing is that you are your own boss.And you get to decide who you want to work with, what you want to work on and when you want to work.However, freedom comes with a price.As a business owner, you will need to have the discipline to work hard on your business because no one is going to be there to supervise you.Question #3: Do you have any experience or expertise in any specific field?There are more work from home online job opportunities for certain fields such as IT, Programming, Marketing, Accounting, Project Management, Writing and Customer Service.Below is a screenshot of the job categories for work from home jobs that are hiring now:So, if you have any experience working in any of the job categories, you can check out job sites for any job that matches your skills and experience.And if you want to work online from home as a freelancer, here are the categories from Upwork where businesses want to hire a freelancer to work remotely from home.If you look closely, it is actually very similar to the Flexjobs.com job categories.So, if you have the skill set that falls under either one of the categories, it will be much easier for you to get a work from home job.Free Training: How I Generated A Full-Time Income Online With My Blog In Less Than 12 MonthsGET STARTED NOW

survey)How To Determine If Work At Home Opportunities Are LegitFirst of all, you can do a simple Google search on the company.So, here are some keywords you can use when you do a Google search:Company NameCompany Name + GlassdoorCompany Name ReviewsCompany Name + Job RoleWhen you do a Google search, you can use the following questions to help find the information you need.Is the company an established and reputable company?Are there any reviews online about the company?Are the reviews good or bad?Do they pay on time?Do they pay well?Do they provide great training and support?Secondly, you can go to relevant Facebook groups or online forums to ask if anyone has any experience working for this company.So, how do you find the right Facebook group to join?One way is to enter broad keywords such as “online jobs”, “at home jobs”, ” remote jobs” , “work from home jobs” or use more specific keywords related to the job role you are interested in.Thirdly, you can go to Linkedin and search for people who have worked or are working for the company.Then, you can reach out to them and find out more about the company and the job role you are applying for.It’s always good to talk with past or existing employees before you apply for the job position so that you can make a more informed decision.Here is a list of reputable companies that are hiring right now for work from home job positions:Amazon Virtual Job PositionsZoomZapierHow To Get A Work From Home JobMethod #1: Apply Through Job PortalsYou can go to job portals and search for online job listings.One of the most trusted job portals for work from home jobs is Flexjobs .After trying all the other jobs portals out there, I highly recommend Flexjobs for the following reasons:It has been successfully helping people find jobs for 10 years with tons of success storiesIt’s the largest job website for curated remote work from home and flexible jobs.It hand-screens every single job and company for legitimacy to give you a clean, ad-free and scam-free job search.It has professional job listings in over 50 career categories ranging from entry-level to executive, freelance to full-time, and local to global.It works with all the reputable and well-known companies such as Apple, Dell, PWC, SAP, and SalesforceIt also offers you excellent job searching resources such as one-on-one career coaching, resume review, expert skills tests, video introductions, and more to help you find your dream jobHere are just some of Flexjobs’ customer reviews:“I was hesitant to subscribe considering the cost relative to other job boards, but it worked out well. FlexJobs was well worth the subscription price. It provided the best selection of telecommuting positions, and I ended up getting hired within the first month.” – Paul C, Bainbridge Island, WA“I applied to over 130 jobs online (on other sites) and had given up trying. I honestly had no success despite having what I considered related experience, an accredited course, and a national certification exam. I only applied to approximately 10 to 12 jobs on FlexJobs. It is the best resource for flexible work. I’ve never been happier with my career! ” – Jean B, Jefferson Township, PA“I have found two well-paying freelance editorial positions through FlexJobs. I have been a freelance writer/editor for about 15 years, and there are myriad of job boards out there flooded with people looking for work. Many companies also offer terrible rates for highly skilled work, which undermines the publishing industry. I see very little of that on FlexJobs. I can understand why people are reluctant to pay for job boards, but I think the small fee is well worth it. I highly recommend it.” – Meghan G, Frederick, MDHowever, Flexjobs operates as a paid subscription service compared to other job portals.The main reason is that there is TOO MUCH SCAM out there when it comes to online jobs.To make sure that ONLY legit online job opportunities are listed on Flexjobs website, its employees will personally verify each and every job listing.For me, I would rather pay a small fee to access all the verified legit job listings than having to do my own research on every job listing that I see.The time saved is worth so much more.On top of that, it can help me get hired much faster because I can focus on how to perfect my resume and prepare myself for the job interview instead of worrying about if the company I am applying for is legit or not.So, how much does Flexjobs subscription plan cost?It has four different pricing plans:1-Week Plan at $6.95 or $1/day1-Month Plan at $14.95 (usual price is $27.80) or $0.50/day3-Month Plan at $ 29.95 (usual price is $83.40) or $0.33/day (Most Popular)One-Year Plan at $49.95 (usual price is $361.40) or $0.13/day (Best Value)The Flexjobs’ One-Year Plan priced at $0.13/day is the best value of all while the 3-month plan priced at $0.33/day is the most popular plan for remote job seekers.The best part is that all Flexjobs’ plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee.If you are serious about finding an online job, this might be the best investment you could invest in yourself.Right now, there is a special promotion of 30% OFF just for my audience by applying this discount coupon “FLEXLIFE” at Flexjobs.With this special discount, the 3-month plan is FURTHER DISCOUNTED to just $20.90 while the one year plan to just $34.96.Try out Flexjobs Risk-Free NowBelow is a list of other job portals:Virtual VocationSkip the DriveWeWorkRemotely.comRemote.coJustRemotePangianRemote OKWorking NomadsJobspressoEuropeRemotelyJobscribeWfh.ioOutsourcelySo, how do you increase your chances of getting hired for online jobs?First, you must think from your hiring managers’ point of view.Ultimately, a hiring manager wants to hire someone who can do well in the advertised job position and deliver the results the company wants to see.So, what are they looking for in the job candidate?Any specific skills?Any specific qualifications?Any relevant work experience?In your resume, you should be concise and specific, and only highlight things that can help you convince the hiring manager that you are the right person for the job.Why?According to research carried out by The Ladders.com in 2012, the average time spent reading a CV was just 6.25 seconds.So, don’t make the mistake of thinking the longer the better.Next, it’s expected that many people will be applying for the same home-based job position.So, what can you do to stand out?Be creative and different.For example, when most of the people are sending written resumes, do you think you will catch the hiring manager’s attention by sending a video resume?Lastly, don’t be afraid of getting rejected.Ask them politely for feedback, so you know what you can do to improve your chances the next time.Method #2: Work Online From Home As A Freelancer Or Service Business OwnerYou can choose to work online as a freelancer by turning your skills into services that other businesses or individuals already want and are willing to pay for.Selling services is actually one of the quickest ways to make money. It is all about solving problems and providing value for other people.So, what skills do you have that can be turned into a service that is already in demand?First of all, I want you to write down your skills ( preferably at least 5)If you are struggling to come up with ideas, it helps to take a look at the following:Books you usually readActivities you do in your free timeWebsites you frequently visitTools you often useResults you’ve gotten for yourself or othersCertifications you have obtainedSubjects you have studiedAlso, you can ask your friends and family what they think you are good at.Once you have your top 5 skills, I would like you to think about what problems you can help other people solve with each skill.So, who are you helping with your service?Are you helping other businesses solve their problems?Or are you helping individuals?Ideas For Business Services:Digital Advertising ServiceGraphic Design ServiceSocial Media Marketing ServiceCopywriting ServiceTranslation ServiceWebsite Design ServiceLegal ServiceAccounting ServiceSEO ServiceProject Management ConsultingPR ServiceTax ServiceHR/Payroll ServiceVideo Editing ServiceIdeas For Personal Services:Career Consulting/Help (Resume editing / Interview Prep / Finding job)Give Lessons (Music, Language, Arts, Sports)Fashion ConsultingRelationship ConsultingTravel PlanningTax & Financial PlanningSAT PrepCollege Application ReviewNow, how do you get clients online for your services?One of the best ways is to create an account on freelancing platforms and then you list your services there.For some platforms, they also provide a list of new and open jobs that you can apply for.Freelancing Platforms:FiverrUpworkFreelancer.comEnvato.comCoworksGun.ioAuthentic JobsProbloggerBlogging ProCanadian Freelance WritingAll Freelance Writing Job BoardContenaTextbrokerWriterAccessWhat if you don’t have a sell-able skill?You can also start a service arbitrage business and sell other people’s skills and services at home.This way, you can focus on just getting and serving clients and not worry about doing the work itself.This is how an agency model works.Further Reading:Service Arbitrage Case Study: How I Made $1,000/Month With No ExperienceGenerally, it is easier to sell to businesses because they are always looking for help to solve their business problems and they also have the willingness and the ability to pay for solutions.A few years ago, I started my own service business offering graphic design services to businesses.The interesting part is that I didn’t do the graphic design work myself.What I did was that I found a group of talented freelancers online from platforms such as Fiverr and Upwork and asked them to work with me because I always have projects that I want to outsource.My freelancers need work. And I need talented people to help deliver the work for my clients.It is a win-win situation.So, if you don’t want to sell your own skills or don’t have the time to deliver the services yourself, you can consider Service Arbitrage.Method #3: Start A Blog and Sell Your Knowledge OnlineSo, why do I recommend blogging as a work-at-home job?Reason #1: It’s easy and quick to get started.All you need is a domain name and web hosting.Typically, you can get a decent blog set up with a $3.95 per month web hosting plan from Bluehost (I used it to set up this blog).Read Also: The Ultimate Guide: How To Buy A Website Domain NameHere’s the good news.Even if you are not tech-savvy, you can set everything up with just a few clicks.Reason #2: You can build and grow your blog on the side without quitting your job.It’s extremely flexible.If you have other commitments, you just need to fit your blogging schedule around them.Reason #3: There are many ways to earn money from your blog.Most of them are truly passive income.Let’s take my own blog as an example.I love writing and love to talk about personal finance.When I started my blog, “Earn More Live Freely”, I didn’t expect that it would one day become a full-time business for me.But, as my blog audience gets bigger and bigger, I started to monetize my blog with my own information products and services.Pretty soon, I grew my revenue to a full-time income.And it’s still growing.The best part about my blogging business is that all my products and services are sold on auto-pilot.In other words, the entire sales process from lead generation to closing the sale to product delivery is FULLY automated with an email marketing software called GetResponse.With this tool, that means I can be making sales even when I am sleeping or out having dinner with family and friends.Now, you might be wondering if you can actually do this as well.The short answer is yes.Because I started from scratch just two years ago with no idea and no experience.Here’s another real-life case study of how you can turn your knowledge into a full-time business.Below is a screenshot from a website called “Piano In 21 Days”.When you first saw this website “Piano In 21 Days”, you might think that a pianist or a piano teacher started it.Actually, it’s NOT.The website owner, Jaques, has a hobby – playing the piano.And he started to learn how to play piano at a young age as a hobby and later went on to pursue an engineering career which is totally unrelated to piano.Out of his passion for piano, he started his blog ON THE SIDE, to share his knowledge about piano playing and help beginners learn how to play in a short period of time.So, how does he make money from his blog?There are two obvious ways that he earns an income.But his main income source is from his online course teaching people how to play piano in 21 days.So far, he has had more than 3,500 paying students.His second source of income is affiliate commission from promoting Amazon piano-related products.How he does it is that he writes a very detailed piano buying guide to help his audience make a purchase decision.Inside this guide, he recommends Amazon piano-related products.If anyone clicks his affiliate link in the guide and makes a purchase based on his recommendation, Amazon is going to pay him a small commission at no extra cost to the buyer.By turning his knowledge into a full-time business, he is able to quit his job and support his family with this blog.When it comes monetizing your blog, I recommend that you start with affiliate marketing first because it’s the quickest way to make money from your blog.Right now, more than half of my blog revenue comes from affiliate marketing.The best part about affiliate marketing is that it’s completely passive.So, you could be earning an affiliate commission even while you are sleeping or spending time with your family.That’s also one of the reasons I chose affiliate marketing because it gives me a lot of flexibility to spend more time with my son.Here’s an example of me promoting investment books on my website.Basically, what I did was that I signed up to be an Amazon affiliate.As an Amazon affiliate, I can promote any product that is being sold on Amazon using my unique affiliate link ( yes, that is how they know the sale is referred by you)The investment books above are shown at the end of one of my investing blog posts because I felt that it was relevant and it might even be helpful to some readers who want to read more on the topic.If my readers think that the book is good and decides to buy, then I will be paid a small commission by Amazon at no additional cost to him or her.So, I highly recommend affiliate marketing to anyone who wants to start blogging for the first time.But, to succeed in affiliate marketing, you need to learn how to get started the right way.Here’s a FREE affiliate training that you can sign up to get yourself started.SummaryHere are many work-from-home job opportunities around if you have the right skill set. But, if you don’t have it, you can easily learn a new skill by taking courses or getting a certification.If you want legit, quick, and easy ways to earn extra cash online, you can try the following:Inbox Dollars (Claim your FREE $5 now)Swagbucks (Over 400 million dollars paid out)Pinecone Research (Minimum $3 per survey)Related posts:A Beginner’s Guide: How To Start Your Side Hustle NOW (2020)A Beginner’s Guide: How To Make Money Selling Online CoursesThe Complete Beginner’s Guide: How To Start A Blog (From Scratch)A Beginner’s Guide: How To Find Easy Things To Flip For ProfitWhat Are The Best Online Jobs For College Students?
