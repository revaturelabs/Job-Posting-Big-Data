With a goal of addressing local health and nutritional needs while providing employment and training opportunities for low-income residents, People’s Grocery’s mission is to build a local food system that can improve the health and economy of the West Oakland community. People’s Grocery develops programs in nutrition education, social enterprise, sustainable/urban agriculture and youth development.DESCRIPTIONAs People’s Grocery progresses towards its greatest goal - a community grocery store in West Oakland – we are preparing for the eventual transition of our founding Executive Director as he turns his full-time focus to developing the retail business and becoming a member of its management team. Central to this transition will be the hiring of a new leader aligned with the mission, vision and values of People’s Grocery who is capable of leading the organization into an exciting and productive future. The new Executive Director will receive training and mentorship from the current Executive Director, as well as assistance in establishing relationships with the organization’s staff, clientele, partners and funders prior to the current Executive Director’s departure. The current Executive Director will then assume an interim role on staff as “Enterprise Project Specialist”.HOW TO APPLYPlease email or fax cover letter and résumé to: Carina Wong, Board Secretary, [email protected] or fax to (510) 652-7602.More here and please visit www.peoplesgrocery.org for information.DEADLINEPosition open until filled.Categories:UncategorizedShare this post:↑ Back to topStay in the know!
