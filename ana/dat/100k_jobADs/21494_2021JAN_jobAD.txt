Lauren Graham, who starred in Gilmore Girls, talked about listing all of her jobs in her life time. I decided to take her lead. In the process of making this list, I learned these 5 these things.1. Never be to proud to hustle. We all had to start somewhere2. Never forget where you came from. This keeps you grounded.3. Everyone needs to pay a grocery bill. Even during the unhappy jobs we all still need to eat. Push through the unhappy jobs.4. Be proud to have a history of working hard. Others are jobless. Choose to be thankful.5. Somethings never change. One of those things......you will always need a place to sleep, a roof over your head, and a full tummy.BabysitterChamber MaidPopcorn Sample GiverFrench Fry MakerDance TeacherClinique Sales AssociateBank TellerActress at a Dinner TheatreBirthday Party EntertainerFoster MotherComputer TeacherWriterMarketing StrategistToy DemonstratorWord of Mouth shopping experience influencerEvent coordinator for social goodCivic Recruitment and Social Media Engagement DirectorTv Personality/Guest ExpertFood Network AmbassadorTravel WriterPR and Engagement DirectorPublished AuthorTourism SpokeswomanSocial Media StrategistPresident of a nonprofitDirector of a MusicalRetail salesOrganizer of housePaid bloggerI started working when I was 13.
