September 13, 2010 /in Condors Mailbag /by condorsMailbag Post:From: JoshComments: How do we have to be dressed for the job fair?Mailbag Response:Josh, it’s always a good rule of thumb when going for an interview that you look as presentable as you care to have your prospective employer see you. It’s better to over-dress than under-dress, so I’d leave the jeans with holes in them and your Nirvana t-shirt at home.We won’t say that you need to wear a suit, necessarily, but I’ll put it this way: there will be hundreds of people there looking for a job, and only a few dozen people will be hired. Like it or not, that first impression you make is going to be the long walk from the seating area to your interviewer’s table, so make sure that first impression is a good one!Good luck!-The Mailbag GuyShare this entryShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare on PinterestShare on LinkedInShare on TumblrShare on RedditShare by Mail/_media/logo_1819.png 0 0 condors /_media/logo_1819.png condors2010-09-13 20:22:402010-09-13 20:22:40From Josh: How do we have to be dressed for the job fair?Recent NewsHOLTY’S BLOG: This thing on?January 14, 2021 - 11:50 amCondors Training Camp Driven by Three-Way ChevroletJanuary 11, 2021 - 1:45 pmTeddy Bear Toss Drive-Thru on Nov. 28November 12, 2020 - 7:45 am“Tickets for Tests” initiative designed to help open up more businesses in Kern County and get people back to workOctober 1, 2020 - 9:28 amKIM JOINS MAPLE LEAFS AS VIDEO COORDINATORSeptember 1, 2020 - 9:03 amFrom the BlogHOLTY’S BLOG: This thing on?January 14, 2021 - 11:50 amHOLTY’S BLOG: THE KID LINENovember 8, 2018 - 2:07 pmHOLTY’S BLOG: ONE MONTH INNovember 1, 2018 - 12:40 pmFollowon TwitterSubscribeto RSS Feed© 2019 Bakersfield Condors.
