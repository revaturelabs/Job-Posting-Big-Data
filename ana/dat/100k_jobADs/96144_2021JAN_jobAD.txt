The company will never divulge how they treat their employees, the benefits they don't provide, the essence of equal opportunities for women and minorities, or how stressful the actual job is. Reading reviews about a company before you apply for a job, helps you gain knowledge about the company's culture, management attitude, and leadership style and their stance on benefits to works and equality. What you learn from company reviews Company culture Company policy Salaries and other compensations Company benefits Management style Therefore if you are looking for a job and wondering whats it's like to work for that company, then read the workplace reviews by current and former employees.

You can find important information on the company website, company reviews on job websites and ask people who work at these companies. You can learn a lot about the company from the company`s social media posts and press releases. You will gain a lot about the company `s goals, culture and how it treats its workers. From this information, you will be able to determine how your background and skills make you a great fit for the company. Do some research on the interviewer- Researching the person who is going to conduct the interviews gives you confidence when you walk into the office for the interview. This knowledge will put you ahead of their competition. You can easily find the interviewer's bio on the company website, social media or on Linkedin profile. Look for any connections that you may have with the interviewer. You may come from the same town, maybe attended the same school or university, have common friends or belong to the same professional association. Practice answering questions to the most common interview questions you should be able to answer commonly asked questions easily and eloquently. Practice interview questions such as \" Tell me about yourself?\" or \" Why do you want to work for this company? Start by developing a list of questions that are likely to be asked by the company and then prepare answers to these questions. Look for the company`s commonly asked interview questions from job sites such as Glassdoor and indeed. Practicing these questions helps to reduce stress during the actual interview and boost your confidence when you answer these questions. Read and understand the job description- Each job description typically contains a brief summary of the duties and responsibilities associated with the job, the preferred qualifications and some information about the company. A job description may include whether its part-time, full time or remote job and may mention the salary range the company is expected to pay you. Please take note of the specific skills the employer is looking for and how your skills measure up to them. Look back into your current and past work history to look for examples and skills you learned over the years that align with these skills. Have a list of references ready- Almost all interviews will ask for a list of references of people who can vouch to your character and professional ability. The interviews often ask for this during or after an interview. Therefore prepare a list of references ahead of time. The best source for any reference is your current or former manager or direct supervisor. Other good sources for a reference are current or former workmates, academic advisors or former employers or mentors. Having a reference list ready helps speed the hiring process and gives you an advantage over other job candidates. Always ask people you want to list as referrers if they are comfortable with that before they start getting unexpected calls from recruiters. Get a buddy to practice answering interview questions- Practising answering interview questions by saying them aloud or enlisting a friend or professional career counselor is a very effective way to prepare for an interview. Practicing answering interview questions is especially helpful for people who don't have interview experience or have not done an interview in a long time. The practice allows you to think through what questions you are likely to be asked and how to answer them with confidence. A mock interview helps you answer difficult questions, sharpen your interview answering strategy, improve communication skills and reduce stress during the actual interview. This reduction in stress level helps you concentrate on making connections with the interviewers. Prepare actual examples of your achievements- During the interview, the interviewers are likely to ask for specific examples of work you have achieved or job goals you have met. Review the job description and then list the work you have done or goals you have met that and how these align with the new job. Quantify your achievements, focus on results and any highly positive feedback you received Prepare questions to ask the interviewersRead morePosting your resume to the right job site mixFeb 19, 2020Use the right mix of job websites in your job search methods. Many job seekers focus on big job websites such as indeed.com. But according to experts, unless you're in a high-demand field, this is one of the least effective job search methods, with only about 10% (at best) success rate. So don't spend more than 10% of your time at this activity. Here are guidelines for making good use of your time online: Explore niche, or specialty, job boards. Don't just post on Monster. Also, look at sites like LiveITjobs.com for technology or Ebberhealthjobs.com for health care. Target websites of companies you're interested in. Determine which companies to target and post resume to their sites. Better yet, contact these employers directly. Consider regional job boards. To find these boards, type your state and the words \"job board\" into Google (e.g., Minnesota job board ) or try your local library's website. Try \"aggregator\" sites like indeed.com,. These sites combine search results from job boards, company websites, professional associations, and other sources. Try professional association websites. Professional associations often post jobs for their members. View the Professional Association Finder to explore options. Check out Avacko.com, which includes four job bank sources, including your state job bank. But since experience shows it's not the best way to get noticed, it's helpful to use a few different methods, including networking your resume in person.Read moreView All Career AdviceJobs by CategoryJobs by CitySorry, we don't currently have any jobs for this search.
