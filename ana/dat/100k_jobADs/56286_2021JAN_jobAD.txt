The industry designation is the primary one for the parent's operations overall. The totals are adjusted to account for the fact that each parent's entries may include both agency records and settlement announcements for the same case; or else a penalty covering multiple locations may be listed in the individual records for each of the facilities. They are also adjusted to reflect cases in which federal and state or local agencies cooperated and issued separate announcements of the outcome. Duplicate or overlapping penalty amounts are marked with an asterisk in the individual records list below.Top 10 Parent CompaniesTotal Penalty $Number of RecordsBP $29,155,941,533 236Occidental Petroleum $5,411,970,886 170Exxon Mobil $1,573,347,749 388Marathon Petroleum $1,484,145,191 346Royal Dutch Shell $1,247,600,374 621Valero Energy $1,071,106,343 326Chevron $987,669,120 711Phillips 66 $653,143,969 238Williams Companies $567,866,543 103Total S.A. $482,972,946 148Individual Penalty Records:Click on the company or penalty amount for more information on each case.
