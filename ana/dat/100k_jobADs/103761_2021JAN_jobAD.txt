If the power is disconnected (but not USB), the motors will stop working but you will not get an error message. You might try wiggling the power cord while printing to see if that makes any difference.Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories— Established 2006 —Evil Mad Scientist ForumsProduct Support ForumsAxiDrawEgg-BotWaterColorBotClock KitsLED Matrix KitsAYABLarson Scanner and MenorahOther kits and productsGeneral ForumsAsk an Evil Mad ScientistBlog ProjectsElectronicsMicrocontrollersSoftware ToolsLog InUsername:Password:Keep me signed inLog InRegisterSearch ForumsSearch for:Search for:Explore our ArchivesExplore our Archives Select Category Art (370) Costumes (35) Play with your food (122) Ask an Evil Mad Scientist (1) Education (87) EMSL Projects (774) AxiDraw (14) Eggbot (93) WaterColorBot (48) EMSL Tests & Quizzes (7) Engineering (592) Basics (26) CNC (102) Electronics (319) Microcontrollers (94) Robotics (66) Everything Else (263) Evil Mad Scientist Shop (91) Field Trips (167) General News (83) Site News (22) Mathematics (40) Open Hardware (83) Reviews (18) Science (100) Citizen Science (5) Nature (19) Software (46) Vintage Technology (71)Bookmark usTwitter: @EMSLFacebook pageTumblr LinkblogfeedburnerRSS FeedYouTube ChannelToolsRegisterLog inEntries feedComments feedWordPress.orgCopyright © 2006-2020 Evil Mad Scientist.
