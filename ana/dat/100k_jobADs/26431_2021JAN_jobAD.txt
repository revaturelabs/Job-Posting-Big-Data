I think I may be falling into the biggest trap that Side Hustlers fall into: over thinking things. I feel like I don’t even know my skills and abilities. I feel that I cannot even pinpoint what things I can offer, to solve problems. So I guess I do not want to ask you guys how to come up with ideas, but I guess I want to ask, has anyone had problems with finding out what they are good at? What side hustle are you good at?Reply	Don The Idea GuyAugust 4, 2017 at 12:15 pm	Awesome, awesome, episode!Easily makes it into my top-10 all time SHN podcasts.I really enjoyed Cathy’s energy, creativity, insight, and generosity.I’ve shared this interview with at least a half-dozen individuals who are trying to get a profitable music side hustle going.Reply	Nick LoperAugust 5, 2017 at 2:37 pm	Thanks Don! Cathy’s awesome!Reply	PeterAugust 5, 2017 at 10:09 am	Wow. She is a one of a kind. Not only she has the grit, but she also has the fire and skills that keep people moving where many of us can’t. I can see a lot of jealous haters out there who think she “has it all” because it’s just her personality or some kind of stroke of luck. She is tenacious and I dig it! Thanks for sharing.I do wish we could all be like this. So many factors I think many of us deal with that lead us astray like poor relationship skills, unable to communicate good with others at points of inflection, environmental suffering, chronic pain, mental health, and all the things that make us who we are. It’s not that we can’t get better at these, (this is the whole reason I subscribe :)), but its more that it will vary on how long it will take which could be from 1 month to 10 years. I like Cathy’s story since she had to go through the bad to get to the good, but I also think she used her heart a lot more than we all do because we are afraid to get hurt about something we love by people who matter. I just hope all of us can take what we have, get outside of our little lives, and begin to piece together what needs to happen from the outside to be at least a tiny bit fulfilled rather than slog through an unending life of nonsense and paperwork for a couple more dimes.Reply	Leave a Comment Cancel replyCommentName Email Websiteyou MUST enable javascript to be able to commentUsually Hustling, Occasionally SocialCONTACT BOOKS WRITE FOR US SPONSOR MEDIATerms of Use | Privacy | Disclaimer | CCPA | Do Not Sell My Personal Information© 2021 SideHustleNation.com	We use cookies to to make sure you have the best experience on our website.
