NCTA pres/CEO Michael Powell took a moment before a breakfast speech to ACC members to note Jobs’ incredible influence, joking that people now cradle their iPhones as if they were precious pets. “How did he do that?,” he asked, noting that “our industry needs that kind of edgy spirit” to better connect with consumers and inspire such loyalty. Jobs “will be studied for centuries,” he said.And as Danny Meyer, CEO, Union Square Hospitality Group talked about commitment to brand promise in CTAM’s Thurs general session, he said Jobs’ approach is a keen example of how “as we get more high-tech, people are craving high-touch… Why do people venerate this one man? Think about the products. The stuff works.” But beyond functionality, Jobs created “products that you needed,” and, said Meyer, if you can’t imagine how your life would be without them, that’s success.The DailySubscribeFriday–January 15RMCA Transforms into Media+Tech CollectiveThe Rocky Mountain Cable Association is tearing down all its boundaries.
