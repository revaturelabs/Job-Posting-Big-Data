Worried you won’t find a job? Don’t despair! Just because there’s doom and gloom in the world does not mean businesses are not hiring.It does however mean competition for the job you are searching for is even more competitive than ever.So, how do you get a step ahead of your competition?Just like Nike and Adidas are two of the most recognizable brands in the world, as a graduate you need to think of yourself as a brand you are selling to potential employers. Consider what makes you exclusive — why should an employer give you the job? If you don’t think your special enough to work for a particular organisation, then why are they going to choose you out of all the people applying for the same job?Remember your resume is one of a potential 100 / 200 if not 500 resumes sitting on the employer’s desk. The hiring manager or recruitment agent have limited time in reading your resume so in order to stand out among hundreds of other applicants you have to market yourself effectively.First impressions count so make sure the right one is made about you.The most important rule for a graduate is the message you convey to a potential employer. Everything you say and do should reinforce the idea you are indeed the perfect candidate for the position. You have the required skills to fulfil the role and the organisation which you are applying for is 100% the place where you want to work.If the role demands attention to detail, demonstrate these qualities through your punctuality and error-fee resume, and illustrate them with experiences about previous positions. Don’t waste time on information that doesn’t reflect your suitability for this particular position.In the technological age we live in and the world changing each and every day, employers are likely to seek and be impressed with graduates who demonstrate flexibility and adaptability, showing that they will be able to cope with these future changes.One last thing – stay positive.No one says it’s easy to get a job. These days many industries are increasingly competitive, and the job-hunting period can be difficult and long. It may take a considerable length of time and multiple rejections before you find your first job. Getting a foot in the door is often the hardest part of the whole job process.Photo Credit: ShutterstockRelated articlesJob Search (Marketing) Strategies for New Grads (turbotax.intuit.com)4 Reasons Youre Not Getting Job Offers (postcollegerevelations.wordpress.com)Cant Get A Job?
