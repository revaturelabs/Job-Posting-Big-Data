But often, the topic becomes general, and we begin mixing sports in ways that aren’t useful. At the very least, for those of us that look at threads for multiple sports, it can sometimes make it hard to not go off topic, and an off topic that is already destined for Cleveland.But sports do play a role in our society‘s response. We can credit the NBA with waking us up and making social distancing a thing we actually embraced. And sports returning is going to be a sign of a return to normalcy.But there are competing stakeholders between players, owners, the media, and the fans. And this is about money and industry first, so each stakeholder is cutthroat. How sports resolves this will in all likelihood be how the nation resolves this.karmajayPosted: June 30, 8:03 PMPermalink0 to Zen in under 6 secondsNCThe other issue is how will owners, leagues, fans deal with games they lose because half of a team is composed of backup players? Will they start screaming about unfairness? Asterisks by records?Pro is five years old. Karmajay has won it thrice, including back-to-back as of today.

Seriously, the country is not close to hosting sports leagues.Instead, plan for next season.Pause all contracts and player rights that teams owe. No trades, releases, FA signings. Teams are what they are today.Cancel league play for 2021. When the pandemic is over, contracts and rosters revert to today.Prepare now for 6-12 teams leagues. Keep it small, and look for players willing to play under bubble conditions.Come up with creative ways to pick teams, and play games, not in f*cking Florida, but in an large, open, low populated state with very little spread, like Montana.Reduce the scope so that there is a path to playing games. Let sports show how we sacrifice, how we mitigate, and how we move on. Unless something drastic happens, trying to play with a full league is going to run into the same problems next year.VectorPosted: June 30, 8:34 PMPermalinkMe Love You Long TimeUnfortunately Rainy Valley in BCJayhawker wrote:Pause all contracts and player rights that teams owe.

But it would be bargaining something rep instead of pretending to start up a season to keep fans subscribed to sports cable networks without games coming.*Edit because I misread a headline, thinking ML canceled, when it was just the minors.VectorPosted: June 30, 9:41 PMPermalinkMe Love You Long TimeUnfortunately Rainy Valley in BCDo you mean the minor league season?

Or two whole teams once they start colliding on the field.So that's what I initially thought as well, and when the Bundesliga had a dozen or so players test positive right before they resumed play, I figured, \"Oh, that's the end of that.\" But from what I understand, the frequency of testing (every two days, constant temperature checks, etc.) allows you to isolate current cases quickly enough so that they don't infect a whole team. They pull positive players out, drive on, and keep testing all the time. So it's a model that is supposed to be able to withstand some degree of positive cases.I do think that football would be the most likely to fail, however.Reading some of the remarks by Fauci today, however, makes me wonder if we're quickly heading for another round of shutdowns before these leagues can even test their plans. If we're at 40k per day now of new cases, and potentially heading to 100k cases with a situation \"beyond our control\", I'd think at some point soon the nation will need to shut down again, taking any and all sports plans with it. Things on a national scale seem to be getting out of hand quickly and yet we seem to be planning for things to go on as if there is no problem.YouTube: Zilla Blitz | Steam ID: Godzilla Blitz | Twitter: @gzblitz | CRPG ClubPrederickPosted: July 1, 1:56 AMPermalinkThe Dark KnightBlatantly Stereotypical.James Baldwin wrote:I love America more than any other country in the world, and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.Watch me learn to draw.*Legion*Posted: July 1, 6:13 PMPermalinkHead CoachS4n74 M4r14, CABubbles don't help when the players show up sick to begin with.Texas is so goddamn stupid.

It has the highest likelihood of actually allowing the season to be completed.Final Warrior Quest - Play it for free!Agent of Fate - Play it for free!VectorPosted: July 2, 10:30 PMPermalinkMe Love You Long TimeUnfortunately Rainy Valley in BCRelated to my previous post; Blue Jays have received a federal exemption letter and are now allowed to host spring training in the Skydome (aka Rogers Centre). The Rogers Centre has a fully attached hotel allowing them to quarantine and practice at the same time. The letter only details spring training and does not grant an exemption for the season.Details spoilered:Spoiler:The Blue Jays will be limited to the dome and hotel’s boundaries, essentially fulfilling the quarantine requirements there. But there are several steps beyond that, as well, the club is taking to limit risk to the wider community:• Under MLB’s protocol, every player is required to undergo a diagnostic/PCR and serology/antibody testing, a process currently underway. Blue Jays players and staff will undergo a second PCR test, and only those who have had two negative results will be allowed to travel north;• Once here, the Blue Jays will have additional PCR testing beyond the every-other-day checks mandated by MLB, and anyone who tests positive will remain in isolated quarantine until he produces two negative tests;• Essential Toronto-based staff allowed to interact with players and staff will undergo the same testing and quarantine process;• Their security screening before flying to Toronto via private charter will take place either at TD Ballpark in Dunedin or planeside to limit contact with the general public;• Private buses conforming to physical distancing and cleaning standards set by the Public Health Agency of Canada will be used for transport from Pearson International Airport;• To minimize contact with hotel staff and the general public, the Blue Jays will have contactless check-ins and food delivery, as well as private dining;• The team will create a quarantine zone with a dedicated room block at the hotel that is isolated from the general public;• Access to Rogers Centre will be limited and the building will be divided into tiered areas to further isolate players and staff, while physical distancing will be promoted through staggered outbreaks, with high-touch areas disinfected hourly.Edit: Apparently the Blue Jays will not be playing any exhibition games against other teams. All games will be intra-squad games.Final Warrior Quest - Play it for free!Agent of Fate - Play it for free!TheGameguruPosted: July 2, 9:38 PMPermalinkHere to save you allPistolvaniaAll these bubble plans will fall apart if they don't let players have huge stashes of weed.. since that's the first thing thats going to crack.Aint nothing new about the world order..it's been playing since the day they put George Washington on a quarterDelivering Truth while the 10% deliver lies.StelePosted: July 2, 10:34 PMPermalinkTIE RequiredNorth Carolina9 more NBA players test positive on the news tonight.What Stele said ^ -mortalgrooveSwitch: 6273-9936-5107JayhawkerPosted: July 3, 12:33 AMPermalinkRock ChalkTheGameguru wrote:All these bubble plans will fall apart if they don't let players have huge stashes of weed.. since that's the first thing thats going to crack.Is it legal in FLA?UpToIsomorphismPosted: July 3, 12:42 AMPermalinkLiterally Created EqualThe Hero of CantonAmazingly, everyone in the NBA suffers from glaucoma.PSN: UpToIsomorphismoilypenguin: That is a terrible joke and I'd ask you to be ashamed of yourself but you've been around here long enough that I know you'll be proud of it.DSGamerPosted: July 3, 5:52 AMPermalinkThumbs Up ... ishAmericaMajor pro sports should shut down again for the year. I don’t see how we play with the country like this when we shutdown under less serious conditions earlier.It doesn’t make any sense. The risk is too great.
