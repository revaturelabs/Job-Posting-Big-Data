He played baseball for four years at Ridgewood High School in Ridgewood, New Jersey, then for four more years at Haverford College near Philadelphia, before graduating in 2012.Zoll, a first-team All-Centennial Conference catcher, led Haverford with a .413 batting average. He was second on the team in slugging percentage (.540), on-base percentage (.506) and walks with 24 on the year. He also collected 32 RBIs on the season. Zoll’s 98 RBIs are eighth on the all-time program list and his 148 career hits are tied for eighth-most in program history. Zoll was named to the Jewish Sports Review 2012 College Baseball First-Team All-America squad (Division II, III and NAIA).Zoll and his family – including parents Lori and David Zoll – lived in Worcester and then Holden, before moving to New Jersey when he was a child. He is the grandson of Robert and Joan Perlman of Worcester. “We are all very proud of him,” Robert Perlman told the Ledger.“My family was able to make it back to Worcester a good number of times during my childhood so that we would be able to see all of my relatives,” Zoll recalled. “In particular, I remember several trips to various Red Sox and Patriots games with my family. Whenever we visited my grandparents’ house, there would be some type of sports game or ESPN on the television, so there was certainly no shortage of shared time with sports being the focal point. I also remember going with my grandfather and father to Assumption College many times to use the college’s baseball field to practice while I was still in Little League.”Jeremy Zoll, front, with family members in Worcester: From left, his aunt Lisa, and grandparents Joan and Robert Perlman.Jeremy was named coordinator of advanced scouting for the Angels in November. “As the coordinator of advance scouting for the Angels, my responsibility is to prepare all of the information for our coaching staff and players on upcoming opponents, and the final product is known as the advance scouting report,” Zoll explained. “Inside the report, there is a mix of the scouting information that I have written, as well as many different statistical reports on the various tendencies of our opponents. Once the report is produced, it is then my responsibility to work with Nick Francona (Coordinator of Major League Player Information) and the coaching staff to make sure that all of the important details are being highlighted and can be utilized properly to help our team gain an advantage.“At this point, I certainly am done with my playing career and plan on trying to continue to develop my career as a member of a Major League front office,” he added. “I played at the college level for Haverford College. Upon graduating, I knew that I had reached my ceiling and that playing professionally was not an option, so I decided to pursue a career in baseball operations.”Email this pageShare on FacebookShare on Twitter	SHAREFacebook TwitterRELATED POSTSUMass Hillel students make a difference in IsraelRep.
