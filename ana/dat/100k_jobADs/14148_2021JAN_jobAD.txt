Author: admin 7/25/2012More job seekers applying to the jobs advertised on your recruitment web site is what every recruiter dreams of (and asks me to do for them). Being listed on top of Google search results is important but the referral traffic from the social media sites is growing rapidly. If you manage your presence on the social media sites you have most likely seen something like 100% growth of the referral traffic from the social media sites in the last 12 months. Google is aware of this and have recently introduced a detailed analysis of the referral traffic from the social media web sites in their Google Analytics product.What social media site will bring you the best visitors and the most job applications?The best way to start looking at it is by the number of pages the visitors from each site look at on your site. Here is a chart I have compiled from number of recruitment and job sites that shows very interesting and quite unpredicted data. The visitors to the job site that came from LinkedIn open only 2.13 web pages on the job site on average. The Facebook referral traffic is slightly better with 3.3 web sites opened by the visitors that came from Facebook. Twitter is the largest surprise here. The average visitor from twitter opens 7.74 web pages on a job site!More pages seen on a recruitment site mean more applications for your jobs!Without entering into a deep discussion why do visitors from LinkedIn open almost 4 times less pages than the visitors from Twitter, it is quite likely that you will get an application from a visitor who have seen more pages. Why? Most of the pages on a job site, careers site or a recruitment agency web site are the pages with jobs currently on offer. The more jobs seen the more likely is that the job seeker will find something interesting to apply for.Do not tweet your jobs!If a visitor from twitter opens almost 8 pages on your recruitment site, you can rest assured that he will find the job he is looking for on your site. Tweeting a single job in each tweet has a low rate of matching the interest of any single job seeker. Tweet something that catches the attention of any (relevant) job seeker. Industry news, salary surveys, skills in demand or something funny bordering on provocative in most cases has the highest click trough rate (on Twitter). With on average almost 8 pages viewed from the visitor from Twitter, you can be sure he will find the job to apply for as well on your web site.Remember, a visitor from Twitter will find your positions advertised on your recruitment web site. Tweeting and re-tweeting your jobs is more likely annoy them more than if you fill the twitter stream interesting data (published on your site!). They will find your jobs when they visit your site.Keep reading...Categories: Jobs Board, Online Recruitment, Social RecruitmentTags: Google, Google Analytics, job, job seeker, job seekers, jobs, LinkedIn, recruitment, recruitment agency, recruitment web, referral traffic, social mediaRated 5.00, 1 vote(s).E-mail Comments (0)If you recruit in a ‘Candidate Driven’ market, it’s time to rethink you advertising strategy!Author: superadmin 4/10/2012Candidate driven market is a phrase one hears from the recruiters when their usual sourcing channels dry up. It is happening now in most countries with the job sites. People expect a bit more from a web site but just a directory listing that a job sites mostly are. In the recruitment agency dominated markets like UK and Ireland, it really isn’t that exciting looking at the job descriptions that do their best to hide who the employer is, where exactly the job is, what is the salary offered, and anything else that could actually make the job advertisement attractive to the potential job seeker?Candidate Driven jobs marketNo applications on your jobs advertised on job sites and your own site is a reflection of the different expectations of the visitor of any site on the web today. Why on earth do you think anyone would like a web page with a sterile job description and click the ‘I Like’ button? Why would anyone share it to his friends? “Maybe I know someone?”. Well whoever I know I would never send to a vanilla job spec without any real info about the job or a company itself.No application to your jobs advertised does not mean that there are no candidates around. Even dressing the issue nicely into the lovely phrase ‘Candidate Driven Market’, doesn’t help the fact that your attraction, advertising & sourcing technique is not working.Recruiter Driven jobs marketYou should control your industry as much as you can. Influence, participate, network, communicate, publish, share, lead, innovate, comment, ask, answer, organise, … be active. Be seen. Be Known (Didn’t Monster use that recently as a product name?). Candidate driven jobs market is happening to the recruiters that simply do not follow the candidates. Not all candidates change their behaviour all at once. A recruiter should look at the trends. It might be more worth recruiting from the source (media) where there are less candidates if there is relatively far smaller number of recruiters.The initial success in sourcing candidates via the social media that the early adopters have recorded is a classic sample. It is not easy to recruit on Facebook or twitter. But guess what? No one is recruiting there! Whoever you find is very unlikely to have ever spoken (gen y) to a recruiter ever!Keep reading...Categories: Jobs Board, Online Recruitment, Social RecruitmentTags: Candidate, Candidate Driven, Jobs MarketThis content has not been rated yet.E-mail Comments (0)Candidates From Social Media Get Hired First!Author: superadmin 3/27/2012If you have been monitoring your source of hire in the last couple of years, you have most likely noticed the trend. There is more and more hires and placements made from the candidates sourced from the social media. If you didn’t notice this trend jet you might want to look into the way you are measuring your source of hire, or you are simply non-existent on the social media sites.The social media enables you to attract candidates that would never ever apply for your job advertisements. Those are the Passive Candidates that you can reach only by sourcing. Social media help greatly in that task. It enables you to ‘speak’ to them directly. It gives you an unique chance to ‘sell’ them your vacancy.The way you go about selling your vacancy can be direct and indirect. The less direct you are, the harder to reach candidates you attract. Here is how recruiters approach the social media:Level 1. Publish our jobs in recruiters tweets, LinkedIn status updates and Facebook profile.- This is the closest to the job advertising model so recruiters are comfortable with that straight away. The problem is that it gives nothing for candidate that he cannot see on the job boards. In fact most of the candidates will feel their ‘space’ in the social media is invaded. Hence the results are similar to the job board advertising, just a new set of candidates have been reached.Level 2. Mixed amount of the original content and jobs data is published in recruiters tweets, LinkedIn status updates and Facebook profile.- The original content created by the recruiter gives reason for following, connecting, and responding to the recruiters content. Engagement level grows from the candidates as the amount and the quality of the recruiters content. Recruiters who publish interesting industry data get ‘listened to’. Those that include their personal views get interacted with. Talking to the passive candidates, what else could you have asked for?Level 3. Time to own the conversations – your own blog!- Social media is great. The more relevant quality content you publish the more Passive Candidates you are attracting. More often than not the other recruiters will join in. And poach from your candidate pools. Remember on social media you don’t really own anything. When you build your talent community, by simple providing them with the content they are looking for, it is time to bring them all to the environment you control. On your own blog you control what content gets published and what not. You have the full control of everything! Publishing in the social media and bringing the conversation to your own controlled platform puts you in power. Here you can control that your talent community is not just ‘stolen’ by your competitors.Level 4. Your talent community becomes Alive!- At some stage your talent community will have its own voice. Your role is more on the moderation and support side. The content contribution of the community you have attracted in the social media and brought to your own platform outgrows your own and takes the life of its own. The recruiter needs to step back and provide a platform for the candidates to communicate freely. It can be online in the shape of the Forum, or a blog network or offline in Open Evenings, Breakfast Briefings or any offline networking event. A barbecue or flashmob would do as well!The higher level (on the scale above) of the recruiters social media evolvement enables talking to a larger group of possible candidates. Not all of the people engaged will ever become a candidate. Some people are just happy where they are. The longer it takes you to get to them, the less other recruiters they are talking to. If you talent community grows your main job actually becomes keeping them aware that you actually exist and are actually hiring. Your activity actually gets far less demanding and gets back to where a recruiter starts – just publishing your jobs, in your own pool of candidates on a platform you control.It does take a lot of effort, and it doesn’t happen overnight though…Keep reading...Categories: Jobs Board, Social RecruitmentThis content has not been rated yet.E-mail Comments (0)Are job seekers using social media in their job search?Author: admin 1/24/2012To answer that question, Jobvite commissioned a study of 2,049 adults aged over 18 across the US, asking them for their opinions on using social media when finding a job.Keep reading...Categories: Jobs Board, Irish Jobs, Social RecruitmentThis content has not been rated yet.E-mail Comments (0)NRF Awards 2011 PhotosAuthor: admin 1/13/2012Click on the image above to see the whole album.Keep reading...Categories: Jobs Board, National Recruitment FederationThis content has not been rated yet.E-mail Comments (0)Parc Aviation wins Best in Practice NRF 2011 Award for Technical Engineering & ScienceAuthor: JobsBoard 12/14/2011Best in Practice National Recruitment Federation 2011 Award for Technical Engineering & Science went to Parc Aviation.This award was sponsored by JobsBoard.ie and presented by Jobs Board Managing Director Ivan Stojanovic.The judges said the submission from the winner of this category was a clear Road-map of their success.
