It’s aimed at smaller, local businesses that might be looking for, say, retail assistants or restaurant waiters.Seeking work: People sift through roles in the Jobs marketplace or are notified of them via alerts. Applications can be auto-filled from someone’s profile, or people can edit them before submitting. Facebook says recruiters only see an applicant’s public profile.Finding staff: Recruiters post jobs on the site. This is where Facebook can make money: Gaurav Dosi, its Jobs manager, says that companies can pay to boost ads so that they appear on people’s news feeds.IM interviews: If an employer is interested, prepare for a new twist on the job hunt: chatting via Messenger with a prospective boss to check in about details, arrange interviews, or whatever. Some conversations could result in employment.And … is Facebook using it to find talent? Dosi says it plans to, in the near future.Article metaSharefacebooklink opens in a new windowtwitterlink opens in a new windowredditlink opens in a new windowlinkedinlink opens in a new windowwhatsapplink opens in a new windowemaillink opens in a new windowLinkTaggedFuture of WorkAuthorJamie CondliffePopularWhat are the ingredients of Pfizer’s covid-19 vaccine?Antonio RegaladoDo your neighbors want to get vaccinated?Karen HaoShould a self-driving car kill the baby or the grandma?
