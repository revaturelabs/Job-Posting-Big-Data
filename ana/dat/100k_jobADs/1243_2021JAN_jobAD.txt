Her natural lips shade was quite pale and her favourite colour is a nude brown gloss. This lady didn’t want her lips too dark for everyday so for her permanent colour choice so I suggested we apply a graduated lip colour. Using a mixture of natural pinks in the centre and gradually getting darker at the border of the lip creating an optical illusion of fullness.Lip Border Tweaked To PerfectionThe lip contour has been altered slightly to create symmetry and definition to her already lovely lip shape. Although the lip colour looks very dark immediately after treatment, within 4 or 5 days the colour will soften by around 70% turning translucent and the client can just wear Vaseline to moisturise and add shine. The colour will fade gradually over the years and the client can come back for a colour booster every year or two.See the healed images below:Completed Effect Of A Watercolour Full Lip Tint Permanent Makeup Procedure.The healed result is amazing. Exactly what the client wanted, symmetry, a perfect new lip shape, optical illusion volume and her favourite colour never to be re applied again!If you would like a free, no-obligation permanent makeup consultationwith head trainer Katy Jobbins …… Then Give Us A Call Now on 01444 300157Download the Latest Permanent MakeupTraining Package Options Now & Train 1 on 1With Head Trainer & 2019 Mentor of the Year, Katy JobbinsSimply Enter your name and email in the boxes below and press the download now button...
