(Malachi Barrett | MLive.com)Facebook ShareTwitter ShareBy Malachi Barrett | mbarret1@mlive.comLANSING, MI -- Michigan employers will need to fill half a million skilled trades jobs by 2026, and state officials are investing $3 million to get the word out.Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Lansing-area leaders in business, education and workforce development announced the state’s largest advertising campaign to raise awareness of Michigan’s skilled-labor shortage. Employers gathered at Lansing Community College Center for Manufacturing Excellence Monday said skilled trade jobs are in high demand as Baby Boomers are retiring, but there aren’t enough new workers with the training to replace them.“We want to really invest in this heavily because there is a big gap to fill,” Gilchrist said. “We think that presents an opportunity. There are a lot of talented, hard working people in Michigan and we want to make sure they know that there’s a pathway for them to have a high wage and high quality career here.”Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer identified the gap in skilled workers as a serious economic challenge during her 2019 State of the State address. Part of the problem, she said, is a failure to create paths to job training.Michigan’s Department of Talent and Economic Development expects 545,000 skilled trades jobs will be created through 2026, mostly in the fields of construction, manufacturing, healthcare, automotive and information technology. Finding highly skilled employees is harder than ever for Michigan businesses, according to a 2019 survey by the Associated General Contractors of America.Convincing high school students to pursue careers in professional trades and replace retiring Baby Boomers is critical to the state’s economic recovery, said TED Communications Director Erica Quealy.Advancements in technology, particularly the rise in automation, have changed the face of jobs in professional trades industries. Employers are looking for workers with knowledge of coding and information technology, Quealy said, something graduating high students should know while planning their next steps.Most professional trades careers do not require a four-year degree, but careers in skilled trades pay 45% more than the state’s median income, according to TED research. Only 13% of high school students consider apprenticeships a good career path, while one in three Michigan parents encourage their children to enter professional trades.Job seekers \"can’t be what they can’t see,” said Edythe Copeland, CEO of Capital Area Michigan Works!The state’s Going PRO campaign is intended to inspire Michigan residents to pursue a career in professional trades. A 30-second commercial will be broadcast on television and distributed through social media statewide, coordinated with outdoor advertising and other events and activities to reach 90% of residents between the ages 15 and 64.“We want people to know they can choose lots of different careers in Michigan,” Gilchrist said. “People, especially millennials like me, we understand that we may jump jobs a few times. When you’re making those changes you have to have access to the training so you can quality for the next chapter of your career.”Michigan has no shortage of hardworking, intelligent people, Gilchrist said, but opportunities are not equitably distributed across the state. Gilchrist said that’s why he and Whitmer prioritized making post-secondary education more accessible and removing barriers to economic opportunity.How Gov. Whitmer’s scholarship plan would work for Michigan high school gradsThe MI Opportunity scholarship wouldWhitmer’s administration set a goal to increase the number of working adults with a post-secondary degree to 60% by 2030, up from 45%.The first-term Democrat outlined several proposals to help Michigan workers find careers in professional trades, including the Michigan Reconnect Grant Program and Michigan Opportunity Scholarship. She called on the Republican-led legislature to pass bills funding both programs.Michigan high school graduates would be eligible for two years of tuition-free years of community college or two years of tuition assistance at public universities. Whitmer is also seeking $110 million to provide adults 25 and older with tuition-free community college or technical training.Whitmer’s plan has the backing of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce President, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Small Business Association of Michigan, Detroit Regional Chamber and American Federation of Teachers Michigan.The state’s Going PRO talent fund awarded $29.4 million to Michigan companies to train nearly 24,000 workers, according to a February 2019 report. A total of $23.6 million was awarded in 2018, funding training for 23,000 people.State officials recently applauded the opening of a new $15 million training center for carpenters and millwrights. The Wayland facility offers apprenticeships through the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters and Millwrights union, which plans to open similar training centers in Marquette and Detroit.New $15M carpenter, millwright training building aims to close state’s skills gapThe 67,000-square-foot building is located in WaylandMichigan high school students were encouraged to sign a letter expressing their commitment to pursue an apprenticeship after Whitmer declared May 6-10 Michigan Signing Week.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/21).Cookie Settings© 2021 Advance Local Media LLC.
