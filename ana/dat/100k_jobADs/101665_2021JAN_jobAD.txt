The positions will start on 1st September 2021, or earlier by agreement, and last for two years with a possible renewal for a third year.The positions are hosted by the Computational Field Theory Group, and are funded by the Academy of Finland and the University of Helsinki, under research projects \"Characterising Gravitational Waves from Phase Transitions in the Early Universe\", \"LISA and the Electroweak Phase Transition\", and \"Particle Cosmology and Gravitational Waves\".The Department of Physics is co-located with the Helsinki Institute of Physics, and has a broad community of high energy physics, cosmology and astrophysics researchers. More information about the research areas can be found at: https://www.hip.fi/There are also close connections to the Department of Physics at the University of Sussex, and the possibility to spend extended periods there. Visits to Sussex will be hosted by the Theoretical Particle Physics research group, which in collaboration with the Astronomy Centre has a thriving research environment for early universe cosmology. More information about the Sussex research groups can be found at: http://www.sussex.ac.uk/physics/researchEarly career researchers expecting to finish their PhD studies by the start date and whose research interests include the topics listed above, are encouraged to apply. Preference will be given to candidates with experience in computing, including python for data analysis, high performance computing, or lattice simulations of quantum field theories or the early universe.The Department of Physics and Helsinki Institute of Physics maintain an active programme of outreach and engagement activities, and have links to English-language science communication organisations. Candidates with interests in outreach and science communication will be supported.Applicants should submit a short research statement, a curriculum vitae and a list of publications through AcademicJobsOnline. Applicants should also arrange for at least two letters of recommendation to be supplied on their behalf.Application materials should arrive on or before 13th December 2020 to guarantee equal consideration.For more information please contact:Mark Hindmarsh, mark.hindmarsh@helsinki.fiKari Rummukainen, kari.rummukainen@helsinki.fiDavid Weir, david.weir@helsinki.fiOr visit our group's website at: https://blogs.helsinki.fi/computational-field-theory/Application Materials Required:Submit the following items online at this website to complete your application:Curriculum VitaeResearch statementPublication listThree reference letters (to be submitted online by the reference writers at this site )And anything else requested in the position description.Further Info:https://blogs.helsinki.fi/computational-field-theory/P.O.
