(D)Introduction: Wakefield Cathedral and its contextGod has been worshipped at the heart of Wakefield for over a thousand years, though the present building dates from the middle of the twelfth century. When the Diocese of Wakefield was created in 1888 the Parish Church of All Saints became the Cathedral Church for the new diocese and Wakefield was elevated to city status. Following the establishment of the West Riding County Council in 1889 Wakefield became the county town. Wakefield benefits from some distinguished civic architecture as a result.In common with other post-industrial towns and cities, Wakefield has faced considerable economic and social challenges in recent decades. Alongside these challenges new opportunities have arisen. The city and district are home to two cultural institutions of international significance - the West Yorkshire Sculpture Park and the Hepworth Gallery — and there is a thriving local arts scene.Wakefield College offers an impressive range of courses at all levels up to and including Foundation Degrees, and a new Creative and Performing Arts College is due to open at some point in the next year. The local Business Improvement District has been active in supporting retail and commercial enterprises in the city and there is an active Civic Society which has done a huge amount to raise awareness of, and pride in, local heritage. The cathedral has developed excellent relationships with all these institutions and organisations and we are well respected for our commitment to developing the common good in partnership with all sectors of society. This commitment is beginning to bear particular fruit in discussions about plans for the regeneration of Wakefield City Centre in which the cathedral is seen as a key asset and with which we will have a significant involvement.Wakefield Cathedral is one of three mother churches for the Diocese of Leeds, the other two being at Bradford and Ripon. Although each cathedral sits within one of the five episcopal areas of the diocese, we all serve the mission of the diocese as a whole, working closely and collegially. All three Deans are members of the Bishop’s Senior Staff Team and of Diocesan Synod and each cathedral has its own honorary canons who are all members of the College of Canons of the whole diocese. Because of the contrasting but complementary nature of our contexts we are able to respond to the remarkable diversity of the diocese in a way that allows cathedral ministry to be owned and valued by parishes in urban, suburban, estate, rural and market town settings. Our spread of geographical location has also enabled the three cathedrals to play a major part in enabling and sustaining the momentum and enthusiasm for mission that has characterised the Diocese of Leeds since its creation in 2014.Job documentsCanon MissionerExpiredExpiredPathwaysLegalTerms and ConditionsPrivacy PolicyLets GoCopyright © 2021"
