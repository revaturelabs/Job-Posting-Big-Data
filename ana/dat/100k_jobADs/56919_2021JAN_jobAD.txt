No kidding, I never even received an acknowledgement of my materials being received. Definitely smells like a pseudo-search.Definitely not a pseudo-search - filling a slot of a Europeanist who left.(1/29) I got the inside scoop on this one: they hired from within - a professor who had had a dual appointment with art history and another department. (1/29): Oh, so that explains how we all got rejected so fast without interviews, and how my rejection letter made clear that my materials weren't even read? Look, if you already know who you are going to hire, don't advertise a national search, okay?So, a pseudo-search after all.

I ask because one of my letter-writers made a comment in mid-Jan that made me think hu had been contacted for a letter, but here we are five days before CAA and it seems I am out of luck. All best to those with interviews (2/6)On-Campus Interviews are on going (3.5.10) **Comment: is it just me, or is this position unbelievably vague? anyone have more info?[what follows is only a rumor, take with big grain of salt and please do correct me if what I have heard is wrong] I've heard they have multiple open positions in Western art that they would fill in an ideal world, but given massive budget cuts they can only hire one body this year. rather than choose which position to fill, they are casting a wide net and hoping to find one outstanding junior scholar who is a specialist in any given one among the open fields, and also willing/able to teach as a generalist. I think [I do not know, but I think] the idea is that, as the state economy recovers, they would gradually hire more people in future years, so that whoever takes this job will eventually just be responsible for their own field, though they may still teach surveys etc. as needed. [does that make sense? I'm curious too, if anyone out there knows more.]-- I heard a similar story!-- The idea makes sense. But the ad for the position, as it is written, is terrible. They have not advertised for any intellectual field (\"challenging the canon\" isn't an intellectual field, by the way.)-- It's an open field search (like many searches in non-Western art history). They don't expect people to teach outside of their own fields.-- ok, but if you wish to compare it to many non-Western searches, those hires often *are* expected to teach outside their own fields, just not to publish outside their fields. It will be interesting to see what happens next.Does anyone know what happened with this search at UCLA????Maybe it was not filled due to the budget? Seems possible, right? Other CA jobs were canceled this year. -- I've heard an offer was extended within the past week or two, but don't know whether it has been accepted (5/18)-- I think the above rumors about a desire by the department to open up several Western a.h. searches (due to many retiring faculty) are true, but there is a college-wide hiring freeze with no end in sight. However, there seems to have been one recent, junior appointment in Gothic art: a female scholar. Renaissance and Greek/Roman faculty might be next...(8/2010)University of IdahoArt History/Visual CultureDeadline: March 1, 2010Any news here? (3/19) --I understand they were contacting references mid-March, but I haven't heard anything since (3/29).Email requesting phone interview (3/30). Interview scheduled: Email requesting campus interview (4/6)Offer made and accepted (5/21).University of Louisiana at MonroeDeadline: January 11, 2010- Phone interview (3/3)- Campus interview (2/9) - Any ideas why campus interviews were held before phone interviews?I had a phone interview before the above-mentioned campus interview. They reposted the job the day I flew down for a campus interview.Any further news? (4/2)I had an email response on 3/8 saying that they were still 'in process', but nothing since that time.Rejection letter received: 4/16 (x2)University of Oregon (Clark Honors College)History of Science and/or 'Historian of the Arts' (2 positions)Deadline: October 15, 2009Interview scheduled:question: does anyone else think that this is a strange position? do they want a historian or an art historian? very mysterious. good luck everybody. I think they want both. ack rcvd (x3) 10/22I spoke with a professor at the U of O in the art history department, and he said the Honors College is looking for an art historian (or music person I think) to fill this position, though I suppose they could arguably select two \"historians of science\" if they don't like the applicants for art history. And yes, good luck everyone.Has anyone heard anything? The History of Science wiki say interviews are scheduled for the History of Science position at the Hist Sci Society annual conference, which is next week. Do you think they will do the Art History ones at CAA?I haven't heard anything, and it's hard to say if they'll interview at CAA. Given the deadline, CAA seems too far in the future for interviews if they're already interviewing for the science position(s) next week. Maybe they decided against an art historian, or maybe they're waiting to review the art history applicants after the science interviews are conducted.Email update from History Search Assistant (11/16/09). Search being conducted in two phases. Finalists for science search have already been contacted. Finalists for Art History search to be contacted in first two weeks of January. Wish all searches were conducted with this much consideration for the applicants. (Though I'm sure part of the purpose for notifying us was to turn back the flood of emails they're receiving!) ha! I was thinking they must have sent out the email b/c they read the wiki! (x4)Does anyone think there is the possibility for an inside candidate on this position? It just seems so odd. Ans: well there certainly is a possibility, but what is odd? the job or the extended timeline? I think they just want an interdisciplinary art historian - ie both art history and general cultural history, etc. There are plenty of people like that. It is a bit of an untraditional, interdisciplinary position, but i don't see why that indicates inside candidate. :) Res: I guess I meant odd that the job was as broad as possible. Perhaps odd wasn't the best turn of phrase. Thanks for the response though. Answ: It didn't seem odd to me, more unusual. Keep in mind that they could choose a historian of performing arts, not just an art or architectural historian. Or, of course, someone who can do a bit of all of those. I thought it sounded like an exciting opportunity, myself. ;) Actually, what I'd like to know is how this position will relate to the Art History and/or other depts outside the Honors College. - a good question to ask at the CAA interview if you get it.--CAA interview scheduled. (1/11) x5Was this via email or phone? Thanks!Phone call with email follow up.What field do you specialize in?Rejection form letter email (1/15) x5Update (2/13): Just returned from interview at CAA. Def. looking for someone to teach in a broad, global framework with subjects that appeal to both art history majors and those well outside the field like biology and physics. Certainly a challenging position, esp. since graduate school teaches you to be a specialist in a particular area/time period, and yet these jobs expect you to look well beyond.Invitations for campus visits have gone out.University of TulsaAssistant Professor of Art HistoryDeadline: Dec. 20thNo word, anyone?Interview Scheduled: contacted by email (1/26) to schedule CAA interview x 3Anyone who interviewed at CAA hear back yet? (2/25) Anyone have any follow-up information about this position? (3/16)Does anyone know if an offer has been made and accepted? (4/5) Apparently so. Letter received 4/23.Virginia Military Institute3-year non-TT assistant professor positionDeadline: December 15Interview scheduled: CAA interview schedule (1/20) (x5)received email on 1/15 that they were in the process of reviewing applications to determine interviews (x4)Anyone have a sense of why this is a non-TT position? Also, it doesn't appear to be adjunct since it is teaching 3 courses/semester and offers benefits, I think...Be careful - there are no benefits for this position. Was contacted 1/15 to check whether I would still be interested even though it is an adjunct position. Chairperson clarified that it comes with no benefits whatsoever.That is awful. If the what the above poster says is true and there aren't any benefits, why would anyone want to take this job? Does VMI not have enough money to ensure that its teachers receive health insurance? Are we not better off working at Starbucks? This kind of thing will continue as long as there are underemployed art historians willing to accept these kinds of working conditions. Shame on you, VMI. (grammar edited, snark removed: let's not attack each other, OK? this should be a supportive place...typos happen).- (np) thank you editor. That comment has been bothering me all day. We are all in such a bind this year with the horrible job market, I hope that we can rise above such caustic and unhelpful attacks. (x2) OK, snarker apologizes, I'm sorry...but I get enough comments about Starbucks without seeing it here, so I was bothered too. I also have some sympathy for VMI; they are hardly set up to make our field a priority, so rather than shaming them for not being able to offer much I appreciate that they are at least trying to broaden their offerings in the humanities...so while I will not attack other posters again, let's also not attack schools -- there's a wiki for that elsewhere.I don't understand why they need to conduct a national search for such a position. Who could relocate for a position without benefits? For someone living in the area, it is definitely a step up from adjuncting on semester-long contracts. This is deeply troubling. Even VAPs have health insurance benefits. Are you certain that no benefits are associated with this position? I agree with poster above: why do a national search? It doesn't make sense.Campus interview scheduled for next week (1/25) - BTW, it is depressing that this is technically a full-time position but offers no benefits(there are definitely none - chair clarified this). However, as noted above, my understanding is that there is an attempt to broaden humanities department. The professor who taught Art History is retiring and/or decreasing teaching load. And, there is the potential, based on budgets and the administrative gods that this will turn into a full-time TT position. Position involves only teaching (no committees, etc.)Thanks for the info above -- can I ask, are you local to VMI? It seems odd to host a campus interview prior to speaking with candidates at CAA. Reply: yes, I am local - had choice of interviewing at CAA or in Lexington.Anyone heard anything else since CAA?I was offered the position last week but have not accepted yet.

They are not filling the position. (This doesn't surprise me. They seemed to want a hire who could teach very, very broadly, which suggested to me they might not be sure what they want.)--Make that FOUR candidates (one who was brought in at the last minute, after the initial three campus visits). Definitely seemed to not be sure what they're looking for.--Wow, I didn't know this! Crazy.My sense was that they wanted someone who could replace a retiring Modernist who also taught some American. However, they wanted this new person to be able to teach some contemporary too. But it is silly to speculate, I suppose. There is no way to know what went on with this committee behind closed doors.--It's shocking that this search failed in this (buyer's) market. 007, eh.Design, Decorative Arts[edit | edit source]Parsons, Assistant Professor of Visual StudiesDeadline: January 1Rejected via e-mail 1-25-10Skype interview early Feb; department reports that campus interviews are underway as of early March.I had a skype interview, but haven't heard anything since then. anyone else in the same boat?4/26: received email last week that i was not a finalist for position.[this is also listed in 20th c, below, where more rejections are indicated]Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century[edit | edit source]University of St Andrews School of Art History: Lecturer in Art History (pre-1800) Deadline: June 24Email rejection notice indicating exclusion from the short list for interviews (7/21); I received an email rejection (7/21) as well (am a Ren/Baroque specialist, FYI).Pennsylvania State University: Visiting Assistant ProfessorEmail request for a phone interview (5/25)Rejection letter (6/10)Princeton University : Postdoctoral Fellowship in Nineteenth-Century European Art HistoryDeadline: March 2Rejection letter received (4/1)University of Toronto19th century European artDeadline: November 20In case anybody is going to send their application last minute UPS/Fedex, don't bother.

If you succeed in keeping their names off this wiki, congratulations in adding 30 extra seconds and one Google search to the amount of time that it takes any reader to discover their names through his/her own effort.Dear Arthist030: perhaps you are new to the Wiki, but we don't post names here. It's not cool. If you are one of the 4, by all means reveal yourself and congratulations! If you are not, you should not be posting names. This is, perhaps, the one rule of the Wiki we need to follow. I, for one, do not want my name broadcast on the Wiki; that's why I go by DanMarino. There has been a long history to this problem, if you want to take this conversation over to \"talk\" page, I would be happy to explain some of the pitfalls involved with posting names. XXOODanMarino, thank you for your response; I will observe that it does not address the substance of my point. There is a material difference between revealing a name on the wiki, and copying onto the wiki information that is already published elsewhere on the web. If you refer to earlier wikis, they will confirm that names, once already public, have indeed been recorded on the wiki.Fellowships: Post- and Pre-Doctoral Art History[edit | edit source]Kress Institutional FellowshipDeadline: Nov. 30Anyone hear?

(3/7)Getty InstitutePostdoctoral fellowship, \"The Display of Art.\"Deadline: Nov 1Does anybody know why they chose the same theme two years in a row? Does anybody else find the theme a bit disappointing?Ans: The GRI always carries its theme through two years--the need for it to be broad enough to encompass many individual's research often leads to rather colourless choices.Actually, I'm pretty sure that this is the first time that the theme has been done for two years. The new type of theme and duration of the theme most likely reflects the new director's administrative and research goals for the GRI.Someone on the Humanities Postdoc site said s/he received an offer for a postdoc on 2/5 and again on 2/23 There are two categories of postdoc funding, one for Display, one for PST. The offers are one each on this wiki.Anyone heard about pre-docs? Do they notify by post, email, or phone?- Pre-doc offer received by email.Congrats !

They posted this exact same job last year, to which I applied and never received a response (nor did I get any feedback on last year's wiki when I asked if anyone else had heard from them).Last year's position was offered to someone who declined it. Maybe that was the case all around. So don't despair -- the fact that it is reposted indicates to me that they seriously want to hire someone.Last year's position was filled by modernist.Postcard ackn. received (1/21) x7 Any news post phone interviews?? Nothing yet; they didn't give me a sense of their schedule and I didn't ask---never know if it's appropriate to or not (2/25) (2/26ish) Campus visit scheduled May I ask how you were notified (email, phone, etc.)? (x2, was told that they would be notifying people either way, so I'd also love to hear how the news was passed on if you are willing to share. BTW, thought it was incredibly nice that they would do that, very refreshing) A: I was notified by phone. They ARE incredibly nice. Campus interview (3/1) x 3 In the listing for Manhattan College under Ancient, it states that someone received a letter saying the search was closed. Is this the same position or a different position? Any news here? (3/26) I also received rejection letter this week stating that search is closed (yes, same position) -- they had around 100 applicants (3/26). Does 'closed' mean the position has been filled, or that the search failed? (3/26) Heard that an offer has been made (3/31) Any idea who the new professor is? Do we in fact know that the offer has been accepted? Also wondering what field since the posting was so broad.

Did anyone else notice the department chair changed during the search? This could be why its being run so badly.I hadn't noticed, but that would explain why the requested letters that had already been sentJust had word from them that they've cancelled the search for budget reasons (3/4)received letter stating same... rather a nice one, actually.

I was recently informed that the College has instituted a hiring freeze and that the position will not be filled (4/5/10).University of ChicagoEarly Modern, 1400-1800Deadline:Interview Scheduled:interviews are underwayAny news here? CAA isn't too far off.... Anyone heard anything about this position? I fear it is canceled like their position last year.I know they have asked at least one candidate (not me, I should say) for additional documents, so it seems the search is still on.I think Chicago prefers to have substantial (often multiple) writing samples early in the process, so they may be requesting additional material from people whose writing samples were not substantial enough for them to get a good sense of the whole. I say this because two years ago I was asked for an additional writing sample for a different search and I do not think it was because I had made it to a second round. (My point is that people who have not been asked for additional documents should not necessarily assume they are no longer in contention).Has this position been advertised several times prior to this year? I know I saw it last year as the person above mentioned, but I also seem to remember having seen it one or two years prior to that? Does anyone know if their searches keep getting canceled or is there some other situation going on?Two years ago they searched for an early modernist and they hired someone who works primarily on early modern Africa (Cecile Fromont). I do not think they searched in early modern last year, though they did run two broad searches. It occurs to me also that the posting did technically have a December 15th deadline (review began October 1, full consideration for applications received by December 15), so they may also just be waiting until after then to make decisions.Just a point of clarification on the above post: it's actually not just that \"full consideration\" will be given to applications received by December 15. Only those applications for which ALL materials (including the three letters of recommendation) are RECEIVED by December 15 can be considered AT ALL due to new university rules. And yes, not receiving a request for more materials does not mean you are out of the running. Applications are being considered as they arrive. Often applicants mistakenly believe they should submit published items merely because they are published, even if they are not the most representative samples of their work, so the committee will ask for something else. Or, the committee wants a second dissertation/book chapter to get a better idea of the project as a whole.Given that the CAA conference is just around the corner, one wonders...Well, they may be skipping CAA interviews and going straight to campus interviews. So they may be on a different schedule. Still, it would seem a strange choice, since CAA is in Chicago this year.Any interviews scheduled?The search is underway, but I am not permitted to give further info at this point.pre CAA interviews took place via skype.one campus visit scheduled for next week. three campus visits took place. offer made and accepted.University of San FranciscoRenaissance and Baroque (Early Modern European Art c. 1400-1800)Deadline: 12/1/09Interview Scheduled: via email 1/19 and request for further materials (x3)Any word on on-campuses yet?On-campus requested via phone 2/23Received rejection letter saying position is filled.
