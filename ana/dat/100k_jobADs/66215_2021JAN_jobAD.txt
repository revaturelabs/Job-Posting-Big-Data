You will be laid off. Your position will be eliminated. There will be a RIF (reduction in force). You will have a lousy boss who screws you over. It will not be your fault.You worked hard, you attended all the stupid meetings, and you didn’t steal any pens or paperclips. But, goodbye, sayonara and don’t let the door hit you on the way out – and oh, by the way, severance and accelerated stock – are you kidding me?Welcome to America and the thing we call – a job.I have been CEO or chairman of more than a dozen companies – and I have been fired twice. And recently a very good friend of mine found that “her position has been eliminated.” A large multinational bought a tiny biotech and they consolidated, and my young friend (with a Ph.D.) found herself out on the street, wondering what to do now.So let’s turn to Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, who famously wrote about the seven stages of grief.1. Shock. Are you kidding me, you’re firing me? Huh!2. Denial. Yes, it is actually happening. I know that the HR person is a rat and didn’t tell you the truth and you got no formal exit interview, but there is no denying it.3. Anger. Oh, why me, it’s not fair. I’m going to call a lawyer and sue them. (Do not do this.)4. Bargaining. Maybe I can make a deal, take a lesser position in the company. I will work for a reduced salary. I just don’t want to go back out there.5. Guilt. It is all my fault. I had it coming. I should have worked 90 hours, not just 82.6. Depression. I am 30 and miserable and alone, and have no job and the holidays are coming. What do I say when asked what I do for a living?Or I am 50 and what do I tell my wife and children? Depression is age independent. It does not discriminate.7. Acceptance. Ah, the sun will come up tomorrow – unless it is June in San Diego. Sometimes, this is accompanied by hope. (I am not big on hope; I prefer acceptance and let’s get on with it).Now, let’s get real.1. Do not broadcast your dismissal to the whole world. They don’t care, and it may affect getting the next job.2. Do nothing precipitous. Do not post your resume on 29 job sites that same afternoon. Breathe.3. Don’t panic. In spite of what you currently think about yourself, you are not worthless or unemployable.4. Don’t be arrogant. If offered outplacement assistance, take it.5. Yes, file for unemployment. (Unless you just got a $500,000 severance like the guy from the San Diego pension board.)6. Take a trip. But not two months. A couple of days, decompress, analyze.7. When discussing the next opportunity, don’t be afraid totalk about the elephant in the room. Disclose early and explain to your advantage.8. If there are health issues, take care of themnow. You probably still have coverage until your departure date. After that, welcome to COBRA.9. Network. Now, No. 9 is easy to say and hard to do well. It is a learned skill. You need to do this. There is no other option. A job will not waft in through the window. There are 21 opportunities in a week – seven breakfasts, seven lunches and seven cocktails. Do not sit home alone and eat peanut butter and ice cream.10. I will bet that there is one person at the former company who was a mentor, adviser, boss, friend, ally, etc. That is the first place to start.11. Do not take the next job offer. Take the right job offer. (This is hard because there is a reality to money.)12. Do not go out and get married or divorced.I have to admit that I have suffered through all seven stages more than once. But I have also been liberated by it. My “next” company was always better. I was free – and could make a fresh start. I could re-invent myself. In a way, “they” did me a favor. And I have always been grateful for it.Rule No. 441“The rest of my life begins now.” – from “Jerry Maguire”###Filed Under: Business, EntrepreneurshipPrimary SidebarSearch this websiteFacebookLinkedInTwitterRecent PostsEntrepreneurs, don’t be so darn hard on yourselvesHearing and listening — two things that are quite differentMaybe who you are isn’t who you think you are youIn 2010, it’s time to put forward focus on the winners in workplace, beyondSecuring power all boils down to personality, expert saysBlog ArchiveBlog Archive Select Month January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011CategoriesBusinessCommunicationEntrepreneurshipFinancial crisisUncategorizedCopyright © 2021 · I'm There For You Baby...TM"
