On this fateful day the Twin Towers, the Pentagon and Flight 93 were allegedly destroyed by the terrorist group Al Qaeda. Even though it has been over 13 years since this infamous day, there have been many theories that 911 was an inside job. The 911 inside job theorists have many different angles and stories that they claim back up the truth. While many of these conspiracies are just plain unimaginable, some make sense. The picture to the right is one of Osama Bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Until his death on May 2, 2011, Bin Laden was on the run from the United State Government. During the almost 10 years that he remained at large, he would periodically give his followers instructions via video like the picture shown.America was told that 9/11 was caused by Osama Bin Laden as retaliation against the ideologies and beliefs that America represented as well as their freedoms that was despised overseas. Bin Laden was named as the main perpetrator of the 9/11 attacks and was said to have recruited terrorists to learn to fly a plane in order to carry out the attacks by having the said planes crash into certain structures of their choosing. Many were told that it was the fast-acting of the FAA to ground any and all planes that led to many more lives being saved.September 11, The Twin Towers Hit by PlaneAfter it had been established that Bin Laden had made credible threats against the USA for years, many Americans believed that it was almost impossible for the United States not to know of this attack. Across news publications in America, many were angry and wanted revenge, and many young men said they would sign up to actually go to war and fight for their country. For all of those that wanted to fight, many more questioned the truth about 9/11. Political experts and everyday Americans questioned if it was even possible for such an elaborate event to take place. Below are some of the most common 911 conspiracies that are argued.Sponsored9/11 Conspiracy TheoriesConspiracy Theory 1: President Bush Was Not SurprisedMany believe that 911 was an inside job and that it was planned from start to finish by the leaders of the United States of America as a way to propel the USA into another war that would benefit America. There are many reasons people who believe this theory to be true. Certain facts have gone into supporting this theory, but it has never been proven. President George W. Bush was told, while reading a book to children in school, by a staff member, that the World Trade Center building had been hit by a plane. Videos clearly show his face when he’s being told this devastating news, and because he barely even reacted, it has led people to believe that it was something he not only expected, but knew it was going to happen, and maybe he had even planned to be in that classroom at the time, in order to make himself look less guilty. It further angered people with his slow movements to action after being told about the incident.SponsoredConspiracy Theory 2: Building 7 CollapseOne of the most interesting and confusing incidents to happen during the 9/11 attacks, was the collapse of building seven. The 7 World Trade Center building was a 47 story tall structure that collapsed on September 11, 2001. Though very few news casts reported about this building collapsing, it was said that the building collapsed when the debris from the World Trade Center damaged the building as well as igniting fires that burned throughout the day on the lower floors, finally causing a full collapse. Seeing that this building was far enough away from the World Trade Center, many have the theory that it was a controlled demolition, that was planned by the government with bombs or dynamite planted at the base of the building to help destroy it at the right time. The theory continues that since no plane had hit the building, which there was no real reason for it to collapse even if there was supposed damage from debris.Conspiracy Theory 3: Flight 93 ConspiracyFor many who believe 911 was an inside job, one of the biggest 911 inside job theories is the Flight 93 Conspiracy Theory. Flight 93 was a United Airlines flight that was hijacked and set towards Washington DC, but to this day an intended target has not been established clearly. Instead of making it to its destination, it crashed in a field in rural Pennsylvania, never reaching its intended target. It was suspected that they were aiming to crash the plane into the White House or the Capitol Building. What has been put out in the news and press as fact, is that there were 44 people on board and sometime during the flight, hijackers took over the plane and tried to fly it towards a specific destination to crash it. At a certain point passengers on board the plane banded together and tried to overpower the hijackers, but it was too late to save the plane from its fate, as it is believed the plane crashed while being overtaken again.Many are not convinced of the so-called facts that were put out about Flight 93. With a plane having to autopilot it and several pilots on board, it was hard for many to believe that a plane looking to get to a target so far away would be flying so low in the first place. It’s also believed that even as it was being taken over by passengers who were fighting to take control back from the hijackers; this should not have led to the plane crashing. The conspiracy theory for Flight 93 is that the government, knowing that the plane was hijacked, and may possibly be used as a missile to cause damage and take lives in the Washington DC area, shot down the plane. It has never been proven that the plane was shot down, but this is a very strong belief by many conspiracy theorists, and many are still fighting to prove that the government, not the terrorists, took the lives of those on Flight 93.911 inside job911 was an inside jobflight 93 conspiracyPrevious ArticleBest Conspiracy Movies – Top 5 and moreNext ArticleMH370 Conspiracy Theories: Missing Malaysian FlightConspiracies.netWe are the No.1 site for providing information on a variety of the world’s most famous conspiracies.
