Words can be used to fairly or unfairly frame a discussion to limit and control how the members of that discussion can think about the issues being presented.This can be done without the members ever knowing that their thinking or options to understand or resolve that issue have been invisibly limited or controlled by outside or invisible forces. Unfortunately, this is precisely what has happened in the framing of today's global warming emergency and discussions.The fossil fuel industry and its lobbyists have successfully reframed our real global warming extinction emergency. This has dramatically hindered the public's ability to think accurately about this crisis.They have invisibly reframed the global warming emergency by getting governments, worldwide media, and even many unwitting environmental groups to use or continue to use the innocuous, vague, and relatively calming words \"climate change.\" This is happening in a real crisis when we should be vigorously discussing the real and highly dangerous global warming extinction emergency.Propaganda in part often redefines or confuses the ordinary meaning of words and concepts to control the target of the propaganda's ability to think or hold specific \"undesirable\" concepts that the propaganda source does not want to be thought about.Here is how the fossil fuel industry has successfully redefined the global warming extinction emergency. The fossil fuel industry has redirected the mass public's attention away from the actual real threat and problem, global warming, to something that is not the core threat or problem.The fossil fuel industry vigorously promotes using the term climate change and not global warming. By doing so, it has turned a scary and real truth that needs to be dealt with on an urgent basis into the nebulous and benign concept that \"the climate (weather) is always changing. Exactly the way it has customarily behaved during your whole life.\"Because of this intentional misdirection, people feel falsely safe and nothing much is done to deal with the ever-changing processes of our natural climate. Unfortunately, nothing could be farther from the truth!It's time to do something about this covert theft of our ability to think appropriately about the global warming emergency and its imminent threat to our existence.The pledgeI hereby pledge to stop using the term “climate change” in my daily conversations. Instead, I will use, the global warming extinction emergency, the global warming emergency, escalating global warming, out of control global warming or catastrophic climate destabilization to describe the current escalating increase in the Earth’s average global temperature and the ongoing and escalating destruction to our lives and the environment caused by global warming primarily due to our burning of fossil fuels. (It is ok to add the following AKA [also known as] terms [climate change, climate emergency, climate crisis, climate extinction crisis etc.,] after any of those more effective terms. This way your writing gets searched more widely on the Internet because unfortunately, those are the terms now more widely used.I make this pledge because:“Climate change” is a misleading term employed by the fossil fuel industry and its advocates to lull the media and the public into a false sense of security. This propaganda is intended to make the global warming extinction emergency seem more benign and non-threatening. It suggests the Earth’s climate is always in a natural state of climatic change, rather than global warming’s direct causation being from human-caused carbon and methane pollution now threatening the survival of humanity within our lifetimes.Rising global temperatures are the most serious currently active challenge facing humanity, comparable in scope of impact to global nuclear war if such were to occur.The idea of “natural” climate change diminishes the real seriousness of our human-caused escalating global warming extinction emergency and it does not directly implicate our increasing use of fossil fuels, and the resultant carbon and methane pollution, as the primary cause.I pledge that I will contest fossil fuels corporations and climate deniers misframing and falsely defining the real dangers of global warming by calling it climate change! We are facing an imminent global warming extinction threat and emergency that is already causing devastating losses due to drought, sea-level rise, air pollution, and increasingly severe weather.I choose to stop using the term “climate change.” By my action, I now bring more urgency and clarity to climate discussions by speaking the scientifically proven truth that our Earth is truly now experiencing a global warming extinction emergency caused by human actions.See how this pledge will be usedAlso, sign the declare a global warming extinction emergency petition for our government leaders by clicking here.(Please note: Our organization does use the term climate change on our website, but only for the purpose to guide people to our website through the climate change search term. In our conversations, we only use global warming-related terms and when we mention climate change on our website we always first mention it with global warming as such, climate change and global warming.)188 signaturesAdd signatureKatrina ElliottGet More Info Here Take Action Support Our MissionSign Up To Learn More About Global Warming!Get accurate information, breaking news, & effective actions you can take now.Optional email codeTweetSign in with Facebook, Twitter or email.© 2016 Job One for HumanityHome Donate Volunteer Search Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Use TrademarkCreated with NationBuilder"
