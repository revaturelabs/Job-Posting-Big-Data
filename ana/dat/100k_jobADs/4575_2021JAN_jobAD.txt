We are uncertain whether we will ever get back to being able to compete globally if this situation transpires.”To prevent this situation, BECA is proposing a Business Events Recovery and Rebound Framework, which calls for targeted support for MICE businesses and employees.The Framework focuses on getting support for the areas that are not covered by existing stimulus measures and meeting the needs of the domestic market.“Close engagement with the Australian Government and a coordinated effort across industry stakeholders is essential to ensure the support targets those areas most critical to the industry’s immediate needs, its recovery and its successful rebound,” BECA’s statement reads.“As an industry, we want to emerge from the crisis in a position to help build business confidence across the Australian economy and, when the time is right, grow Australia’s share of global events in what will be a highly competitive and disrupted market,” Dr Findlay said.FacebookLinkedinEmailPrintEvent Organisershttp://www.eventorganserssummitsummit.comEvent Organisers is a trusted source of meetings, events and tourism industry news, analysis and event coverage.RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORFour steps to Events recoveryMCEC host magical creatures to celebrate Royal Children’s 150thAdelaide Convention Bureau announces South Australia’s bid for prestigious 2024 International Astronautical CongressRecent postsFour steps to Events recovery27th January 2021MCEC host magical creatures to celebrate Royal Children’s 150th26th January 2021Adelaide Convention Bureau announces South Australia’s bid for prestigious 2024 International...26th January 2021About usOur Summits are for in-house corporate event managers, agencies, associations, marketing managers, PCOs, and executive assistants organising large events.To participate, email info@eventorganiserssummit.comAdvertiseWe are also a trusted source of news and information for business events industry professionals.To advertise on this website or via our EDM service, email james.brome@executivepa.com© Copyright 2020 | +61 (7) 3839 4911 | PO BOX 10137, QLD, 4000"
