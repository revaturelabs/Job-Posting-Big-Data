PVA adhesive can be used if necessary to stabilise the surface of the wall. Ultrotherm® can be installed with or without removing skirting boards and coving. Radiators should be lifted from their brackets but the brackets themselves do not need to be removed.Step 2: Installing Ultrotherm® TilesApply Ultrotherm® adhesive to the wall surface directly from the container using a 6mm notched trowel. Once sufficient adhesive has been applied, an Ultrotherm® tile is pressed firmly on to the wall. Apply further adhesive and tiles until the wall is completely insulated. Ultrotherm® tiles should be cut around radiator brackets. These can be covered with removable strips of Ultrotherm® once the wall has been plastered. Ultrotherm® is easily cut using decorator’s scissors.Step 3: Installing Ultrotherm® Without Removing Skirting Boards and CovingA 15mm plastic trim bead is bonded to the plaster above the skirting board and beneath the coving using Ultrotherm® detail adhesive. The insulation tiles are then located tightly into the trim bead and pressed firmly into the wall adhesive.Step 4: Installing Ultrotherm® Insulated Trim Beads and Reveal TilesUltrotherm® insulation beads are installed with the insulation strip in contact with the window or door frame using Ultrotherm® detail adhesive. Ultrotherm® adhesive is applied to the window or door reveal using a 6mm notched trowel. Ultotherm® reveal tiles should be cut to the required size, located tightly into the insulated trim beads and pressed firmly into the wall adhesive.Step 5: Plastering Ultrotherm®The joints between the Ultrotherm® tiles must be covered with fibre mesh tape.Ultrotherm® angle beads are used to form external angles. In most cases Ultrotherm® is plastered using Thistle Board finish or Multi-finish. The first step is to apply a base coat of plaster that fills-in the circular holes behind the mesh covering. The plaster should be mixed to a thicker consistency than normal for this coat. It is also possible to build-up layers of plaster in a more traditional style. Applying a coat of ‘Hardwall’ plaster before the skim coat increases impact resistance. Once the filling coat has started to set, two further coats of plaster skim are applied to the wall.Step 6: Re-instatement Stagereinstated. Care should be taken not to over-compress Ultrotherm® when securing skirting boards or other items back to the wall. Before re-hanging radiators, Ultrotherm® should be placed over the brackets to prevent cold spots. This also allows the radiator brackets to be easily removed if necessary. Walls can be decorated after approximately two weeks or once the plaster has fully dried.Pdf GuideTo download a pdf guide of the above step-by-step installation instructions, click here.Nobody's asked us any questions yet, to be the first by contacting us.Here are just some of the ways it does the job:Economic:Reduces energy bills as you need to pump less heat into the room.Better Consumption:Can reduce heat loss through by up to 40%.Feel good:Only 12mm thick so you keep maximum space in your room;No need to alter the aesthetics of you room.Simple:Easy to install: as simple to put up as wallpaper;Plastered using traditional skill avoiding the hassle of other insulations;Can be cut to fit around the windows, coving, radiators etc… in your room;Bends around awkward shapes.Reliable:Class 0 fire rating.DeliveryHere is a guide to delivery and returns.
