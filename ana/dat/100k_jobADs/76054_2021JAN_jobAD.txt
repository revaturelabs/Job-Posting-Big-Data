I will mostly work on different weddings at weekends in Barcelona and a little bit outside the city. I will work together with other hairstylists and makeup artists on the agency. I have met almost everyone on a meeting we had a few weeks ago and they all seemed to be very nice.This weekend I did my first job for the agency at a wedding in Sitges. The location and the view was incredible beautiful. We did hairstyling and makeup on the bride and the guests in a room where it was i big glass door where we could see the pool and the amazing view. On this wedding a worked together with Adrian and Farah who was lovely to work with.In the end of this post I have a very short video where you can see a little part of the location we worked on.Track: Unknown Brain - Why Do I?
