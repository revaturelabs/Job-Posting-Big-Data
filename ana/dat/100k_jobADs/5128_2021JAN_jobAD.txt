Whether you are looking for the trendiest lunch venue in town, have a random trivia question, or are searching for the best-rated hotel halfway across the world – just Google it. And now, for the first time in the Middle East, you can do exactly that if you’re looking for a job.Google has announced the launch of a new jobs portal aimed at those looking for a new opportunity, to simplify the way they search. Job seekers will find a series of results from across the web on the main Google Search results page, after entering a job-related query in Arabic (for example: “marketing jobs in Riyadh”) that meet their specific needs.This new feature will also narrow down the search even further by enabling filters such as salary information, reviews and ratings of the employer, and location. Google Jobs search has also included an ‘alerts’ feature to notify users of potential and relevant opportunities as soon as they become available.“Connecting people with the right job opportunities that match their skills and interests is an extension of Google’s mission to organize the world’s information and make it accessible to everyone,” said Tarek Abdalla, Google’s regional head of marketing in the Middle East and North Africa.Having teamed up with 11 local and regional portals from across the region, the global tech giant will not store the job listings directly – instead, it will redirect the user to the relevant job posting on a partner site. The new portal is also available to users in Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia.Now Read: Ryan Reynolds Will Be Shooting His Next Film in The Regionby Tala LevittVogue RecommendsCULTUREHow to See Lebanon’s Greatest Sights Without Leaving HomeLIFESTYLEElon Musk Poised to Overtake Jeff Bezos as World’s Richest PersonNEWSMo Salah Tests Covid-19 Positive: Here’s What it Means for His Upcoming MatchesNEWSBahrain’s Prime Minister Prince Khalifa Bin Salman Has Died, Aged 84'); var division = document.createElement('div'); division.className=\"next jscroll-next-parent\"; division.innerHTML = ' '; document.getElementById(\"main_youcantblock\").appendChild(division); }else if(indexCounter == 20){ var item_id = postlist[indexCounter-1].ID; //jQuery('[data-set_id=' + item_id + ']').append(''); // loop again indexCounter = 1; jQuery('[data-set_id=' + item_id + ']').append(''); }else{ console.log(indexCounter); var item_id = postlist[indexCounter-1].ID; jQuery('[data-set_id=' + item_id + ']').append(''); } indexCounter++;SuggestionsArticlesView AllVogue CollectionTopicsالعربيةFASHIONLIFESTYLEGROOMINGENTERTAINMENTSign up© 2021 Nervora Fashion, Inc. and Condé Nast International.
