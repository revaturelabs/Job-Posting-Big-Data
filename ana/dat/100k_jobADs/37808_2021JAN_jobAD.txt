I only lead you to think that because of how I write my posts and/or comments. There isn‚Äôt much anyone on WordPress can do to get me remotely close to angry. Because we‚Äôre all strangers on here and if you want to get upset over nothing, then that‚Äôs your choice. I‚Äôll just nap like I always do and forget about it. BUT there is something I‚Äôve seen more frequently in recent weeks than I‚Äôve seen in my previous two years on WordPress, and it‚Äôs getting to the point of almost pissing me off. Almost.You might know a writer who decided to quit their day job after a year or two or 20 to pursue writing full-time. I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs done that, but I know it happens. I have no issue with that, because it‚Äôs their life and they can do as they please. What I do have a problem with is when someone makes the choice to do that (if they were working at all) and then writes a sob story about how they‚Äôve put off their writing for so long and now it‚Äôs time to pursue their dream of becoming an author‚Ä¶.AND would I please donate my money to help them along the way. UH, WHAT?What the hell did I just read? So YOU made the choice to quit YOUR job and now you‚Äôre asking ME to give you money that I worked for so you can get by while you work on your next great novel? I must be on a prank show. This can‚Äôt be real and you can‚Äôt be serious.No reasonable person would outright quit their job if they couldn‚Äôt afford to do so, or didn‚Äôt intend to try finding something better. Think about that. And there are actually people on WordPress who are doing that and then immediately asking for money from strangers. I guess WordPress has turned into GoFundMe.I once launched a Kickstarter campaign to help with my first book. But it was NOT a campaign to fund a ‚Äúwriter‚Äù lifestyle, it was meant to help make my book better. The book was written already. And you see things like that everywhere, but this is different. What people are asking now has nothing to do with their writing. They‚Äôre essentially asking people to be a source of income. And that‚Äôs just ridiculous.Have you come across this kind of thing? I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve seen it maybe 7-10 times in recent weeks. I‚Äôve yet to comment on one of these posts, but I think the next time I find one I‚Äôll just link back to this without anything further.Share this:TwitterFacebookRedditTumblrPinterestLike this:Like Loading...author, blogging, job, kickstarter, money, pursuit, rant, WordPress, writer, writing, writing pursuit	Post navigationPrevious PostCool Dads in LiteratureNext PostGermany is Banning Books48 thoughts on ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Quit Your Day Job‚Äù	Shanan Winters says:	June 22, 2015 at 11:56 amThere are lots of ways to support one‚Äôs self with writing without resorting to Internet panhandling. Kickstarting a novel is one thing‚Ä¶ asking for rent money so the ‚Äúwriter‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have to stoop to paid writing while fulfilling his or her dream of writing a novel‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs something else entirely. So yeah, those irritate me, too. Roll up the sleeves, brush off the keyboard, and WRITE for your living, if that‚Äôs what you choose.LikeLiked by 2 peopleReplyJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 6:50 pmEXACTLY. There no need to be asking for donations on WordPress just so you can write.LikeLikeReplyHuman Interest says:	June 22, 2015 at 12:56 pmReblogged this on Human Interest.LikeLikeReplyaetherhouse says:	June 22, 2015 at 1:45 pmI have an acquaintance from college who started a gofundme to pay for her rent, travel, and food expenses so that she could ‚Äúmove to New York City and live out her dream of being a novelist!‚Äù She didn‚Äôt even have any job prospects at that point *and* she thought asking for $1000 was enough to put a dent in NYC expenses. Ha. I also love how she thought that NYC is the only place one can become a novelist.It‚Äôs terribly entitled. Write a damn good novel and maybe I‚Äôll buy it, promote it, and/or review it ‚Äì that‚Äôs how I‚Äôll support a writer‚Äôs career. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôll invest in a person‚Äôs talent. Kickstartering a specific project is acceptable, if you‚Äôre looking for some extra money to buy a nice cover, editor, or promo package (plus, Kickstartering a book is basically just taking pre-orders, so your donors are actually getting something in return). Asking for starving artist money is not.LikeLiked by 2 peopleReplyJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 1:59 pmWhat in the world? I hope she raised no money at all. I knew when you labeled her an acquaintance that it had to be a ridiculous story. People can be so clueless sometimes.LikeLikeReplyJohn Callaghan says:	June 22, 2015 at 7:05 pmI hae not com across this. Yet. It sounds pretty outrageous though. Even if a person writes a novel and it is relatively successful, how much money do think that book will make? It could take three or four novels before an author can be financially successful. And if you are an independent author it could take much longer. You know who makes Stephen King money? Stephen King.LikeLikeReplyJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 7:16 pmYou‚Äôre exactly right. Even if you sell a couple thousand copies of your first book (which we both know does not happen often) that‚Äôs still not enough money to do much of anything. I think the people who do this are expecting to get rich from their writing.LikeLiked by 1 personReplyJohn Callaghan says:	June 22, 2015 at 7:19 pmThen they need medication, not money.LikeLikeJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 7:21 pmOr a reality check from a successful author.LikeLiked by 1 personphantomwriter143 says:	June 22, 2015 at 8:08 pmI have absolutely no pity for these people and get frustrated every time I see a blogger or wanna-be post anything like this. No, I will NOT donate out of my hard earned pittance of a salary when there is no reason you couldn‚Äôt be out working yourself. From all of us writers working full-time jobs, with another two or three on the side, and still managing to work towards our dream‚Ä¶ shame on you.p.s. I watched Catching Fire twice this weekend. Twice! I couldn‚Äôt help myself.LikeLikeReplyJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 8:37 pmExactly. How many writers started out working on their writing before bed or only on weekends or during breaks AT WORK? These people believe in some misguided notion that says they shouldn‚Äôt have to do something else because they‚Äôd rather be writing. Who wouldn‚Äôt?Why not Mockingjay?LikeLikeReplyphantomwriter143 says:	June 22, 2015 at 8:38 pmBecause only Catching Fire was available for free with Amazon Prime instant video.LikeLikeJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 8:39 pmI have all three on Blu-Ray. Of courseLikeLikephantomwriter143 says:	June 22, 2015 at 8:41 pmNo doubt. I‚Äôm trying not to buy too much while I‚Äôm traveling. I should just rent it on Amazon.LikeLikeJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 8:43 pmIt‚Äôs gotta be coming to Netflix soon. I think Catching Fire came online in August? Something like that.LikeLikephantomwriter143 says:	June 22, 2015 at 8:54 pmI don‚Äôt have Netflix.LikeLikeJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 9:15 pmIt‚Äôll be on Amazon the same time as Netflix.LikeLikephantomwriter143 says:	June 22, 2015 at 9:37 pmSweet!LikeLikeJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 10:00 pmBut you might as well watch Catching Fire again. Until Mockingjay is available.LikeLikephantomwriter143 says:	June 22, 2015 at 10:02 pmI actually am right now. Haha!LikeLikeJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 10:11 pmüò© obsessed, much?LikeLikephantomwriter143 says:	June 22, 2015 at 10:22 pmIt goes in spurts with different movies. I‚Äôll get over it.LikeLikeJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 10:39 pmCan‚Äôt say you picked a bad movie this time around.LikeLikeElizarose Nicolas says:	June 22, 2015 at 9:01 pmFunny enough just before reading this, I had just finished reading a blog that asked for money for their next upcoming novel. This blogger had also wrote on a previous entry that WordPress was taking much of their time that they couldn‚Äôt manage a job. Then to say they chose to pursue their Dream of writing, but that bills are due and wondered if anyone would be willing to donate. I just pressed like as well as 40 other people, but Thankfully it isn‚Äôt linked to PayPal. I personally, would be too embarrassed to ask for money especially from people I don‚Äôt know. I feel it takes people with a certain type of personality trait to be able to ask for money. Call it pride, but I would rather bust my ass and bleed to death while doing it, then ask anyone for money‚Ä¶ unfortunately like everything, it becomes about money.LikeLiked by 1 personReplyJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 9:30 pm41 people Liked that lost you‚Äôre talking about? I have to read this. Can you send me the link? And I think I agree with you. I wouldn‚Äôt ask for money now. And probably wouldn‚Äôt do it again.LikeLikeReplyElizarose Nicolas says:	June 22, 2015 at 9:38 pmhttp://cristianmihai.net/2015/06/22/special-offers-on-reblogs-5/http://cristianmihai.net/2015/06/01/i-need-your-help-3/Am I being to judgmental? Maybe‚Ä¶maybe not‚Ä¶who knows.LikeLikeJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 9:49 pmI actually know him. Not personally, but his blog. I don‚Äôt read anything he writes. And I‚Äôd never give him anything. It seems to me like he‚Äôs not even asking for money to cover expenses while he writes, he‚Äôs asking for money to blog. He can go work for Buzzfeed or Huffington Post or something if he wants to do that and let a company pay him. Not readers on WordPress. That‚Äôs stupid.LikeLiked by 1 personElizarose Nicolas says:	June 22, 2015 at 9:51 pmMaybe I can offer that advice see if he takes it, because a person who truly wants to succeed finds a way and would take any good advice they can get. ‚ò∫LikeLikeJohn Guillen says:	June 22, 2015 at 9:54 pmMaybe. But I bet those types of jobs require a lot more than a nice blog following. It might be good advice but it also might not be practical. Just depends, I guess.LikeLikeLynn Love says:	June 23, 2015 at 5:31 amThis guy charges for reblogs? That‚Äôs terrible ‚Äì that‚Äôs anti the whole point of the blogging/ interracting/ getting to know people ethos.I‚Äôve been following a blogger who I will not mention, but she recently asked people to give her money to support her blogging- ‚ÄòIf you like this blog and want to see it continue‚Ä¶‚Äô Now, she‚Äôs only a teenager, at college and has health problems which means she can‚Äôt hold down full time work, so I see it‚Äôs a different situation. But my gut instinct was ‚Äì ‚ÄòDamn cheek!‚Äô There‚Äôs too much free content out there for any of us to think we‚Äôre that special ‚Äì I can‚Äôt see many people wanting to support someone to blog full time when you can just do a quick search and find the next blogger doing a similar thing.As you say, get some work with Huffpost etc, work your tale off trying to be a freelancer. Don‚Äôt come begging for cash from your followers ‚Äì you won‚Äôt find any here.LikeLiked by 1 personReplyJohn Guillen says:	June 23, 2015 at 10:00 amYou‚Äôre right. But if I‚Äôm not mistaken, he has like 90,000 followers or something. So there‚Äôs a real audience there. But yes, paying someone to blog is crazy unless it‚Äôs a major company doing it.LikeLiked by 1 personReplyLynn Love says:	June 23, 2015 at 10:12 amIsn‚Äôt it possible to ‚Äòbuy‚Äô followers, too? I‚Äôm sure someone told me that, though I don‚Äôt see the point, as if they‚Äôre not real followers, they won‚Äôt view any posts etc. I suppose it looks good on your stats, though.Of course, I‚Äôm not for one second suggesting that this chap has done that- I‚Äôm just saying üôÇLikeLikeJohn Guillen says:	June 23, 2015 at 10:15 amEh. He came from Wattpad and people followed. Pretty sure.LikeLikealexandrastarbuck says:	June 23, 2015 at 12:25 pmOh my gosh, I so totally agree with this post! I had a niece from my ex-husband‚Äôs side who refused to work for ‚Äúthe man‚Äù, but had no problem asking for money and/or a place to stay from those of us who did‚Ä¶.LikeLikeReplyJohn Guillen says:	June 23, 2015 at 12:29 pmHa! Does she also moonlight as a writer? Although this can apply to pretty much anyone.LikeLiked by 1 personReplyalexandrastarbuck says:	June 23, 2015 at 12:32 pmNope, fashion designer wannabe.LikeLikeReplyJohn Guillen says:	June 23, 2015 at 12:32 pmHaha I‚Äôm just a wannabe writer. üòûLikeLiked by 1 personReplyalexandrastarbuck says:	June 23, 2015 at 12:35 pmYou and me both! üò≥LikeLikeJohn Guillen says:	June 23, 2015 at 12:39 pmFinally someone who uses the üò≥ other than me! Haha that‚Äôs my favorite one when poking fun at myself.LikeLiked by 1 personalexandrastarbuck says:	June 23, 2015 at 12:42 pmIt‚Äôs my favorite too!

I think it‚Äôs okay to donate and support a project that you know you will see, enjoy, or be able to use in the near future. But to support someone‚Äôs lifestyle, I disagree. Why don‚Äôt these writers put ads on their website, or better yet, produce a quality book or product that people will want to put their money into?LikeLikeReplyJohn Guillen says:	June 24, 2015 at 10:13 pmYou‚Äôre asking the wrong person. There‚Äôs so much they could do besides asking for money.LikeLiked by 1 personReplyCrystal says:	June 26, 2015 at 7:06 pmThat‚Äôs true. One has to take the time to think of something creative üôÇLikeLikeS.K.A says:	June 24, 2015 at 9:29 pmWow I‚Äôve never heard of this but it sounds crazy.LikeLikeReplyJohn Guillen says:	June 24, 2015 at 10:12 pmLucky.
