These are necessary steps prior to being able to establish, continue or vary a contract of employment.In some special cases your information may have been entered without your having completed a job application. For example, where students are being placed from a training provider (and your information has been received from that training provider) or where employment checks need to be carried out on existing staff.During recruitment, the recruiters consider the information provided on the job application form and that provided for assessments and interviews.As you get further through the process, employment checks may need to be performed such as identity, right-to-work (immigration), criminal records, professional registration, qualifications, references, occupational health and other checks. More information or documentation, such as proof of identity documents, may be needed from you. Only the necessary information is shared with organisations where they assist us with these checks and it is only for the purpose of performing those checks.To get a new recruit started in their work, induction training and some administrative requirements are completed. Some information will be requested from you at that time, such as bank details for your salary payments and emergency contact details in case you have an emergency at work. The information for those who have been recruited is entered into the employee management and records keeping systems that are used by the employer.If you do not provide information as needed, this may hinder or prevent your application or employment.Any information you provide about your ethnic origin, religious beliefs and sexual orientation is used only for equal opportunities statistical monitoring of the recruitment process and workforce.

This is 400 days after the date the application was entered in this recruitment system or 200 days after your proposed/actual start date, whichever is the greater. This period allows obligations relating to lawful employment practices to be fulfilled such as statistical reporting and the defending of potential legal claims.The data controller for this information is the organisation to whom you have applied.The privacy notice pertaining to a job application ispresented prior to starting the application process when applying via your Trac account;sent by email to applicants who details have been added to Trac by the employer; andshown at the end of the stored copy of the application form, visible via your Trac account.It shows the details for the organisation who is the data controller for your application (usually the employer) and any additional information that they wish to provide to you as part of the notice.Disclosure and Barring Service check application form.This service provides an online Disclosure and Barring Service check application form.

If there appear to be problems with your answers then you may be asked to complete the form again. Otherwise it is electronically counter signed and delivered to the DBS via a secure channel.It is important that you complete the DBS form carefully because it cannot be amended once it has been submitted to the DBS for processing.Once the DBS have performed their check, this system is notified that result is ready and that either:the certificate contains no disclosure of criminal records information and therefore the employer does not need to see the certificate, or thatthe certificate does contain a disclosure of criminal records information and therefore the employer should expect you to show your certificate to them.This system will notify the employer accordingly.The DBS do not provide this system, Civica UK Ltd or the employer with information about the contents of a certificate (i.e. not informed of information about criminal records that it may contain).The DBS certificate is sent by the DBS directly to you as the applicant. It is your responsibility to show your certificate to the employer where required.If you believe there is a mistake with your certificate, you should appeal this directly with the DBS. They will investigate and reissue the certificate where appropriate.Completed forms and result information are retained in this system for the time period specified by the DBS for providers who submit electronic checks. After that period they are deleted automatically.The lawfulness of processing is established under the General Data Protection Regulation article 6(1)(b) as necessary in order to provide you with the service described above and, usually, because it is a necessary step for the contract of employment for which the DBS check is being performed.
