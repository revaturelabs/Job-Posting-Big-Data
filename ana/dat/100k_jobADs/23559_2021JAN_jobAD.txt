In Becoming Steve Jobs, the upcoming Steve Jobs biography, Ive recalls the first time the newly reappointed CEO visited him in his workspace. “He thought he was toast.” (via Fast Company)The first time Steve made the long trek over to the Design Lab, Ive was nervous and apprehensive. “That very first time we met, he had already started to talk about reengaging Harmut Esslinger [the founder of Frog Design, who had designed the first Mac],” Ive says. “He came over to the studio, I think, essentially to fire me.”Of course Jobs didn’t fire him, but Ive says he felt like he deserved the axe, “because the products we were shipping at the time… weren’t very good at all”. But Steve took an immediate liking to the “introverted designer who, like him, had a knack for clearly explaining complex ideas”.“You know Jony. He’s kind of a cherub,” Jobs would later tell Schlender. “I liked him right away. And I could tell after that first meeting that [former Apple CEO Gil Amelio] had wasted his talent.”If you haven’t already, you can pre-order Becoming Steve Jobs right now at this link.Share & commentShare: Tweet ShareRead nextKate Bock Wears the Apple Watch on Fitness Magazine Cover [PIC]Usman QureshiFri, March 20, 2015Comments: 1Most ViewedCanadians Can Now Sign Up for Starlink Internet Beta Without an Invite, If EligibleWed, January 20, 2021If Apple Kills the Lightning Port, an Environmental Disaster AwaitsSat, January 23, 2021You Can Now Buy the PlayStation 5 in Canada OnlineThu, November 12, 2020Rogers Releases Android 11 for Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ CustomersFri, January 22, 2021Rogers Store Robbed and Employees Tied Up by Thieves Say PoliceThu, January 21, 2021How to Close the Stand Ring on Apple Watch Every Single TimeThu, February 2, 2017SpaceX Starlink Beta Invites Launch in Canada, Revealing PricingSat, November 14, 2020Related ContentSubscribe to our mailing listYes, send me daily emails with Apple news!I consent!Search iPhoneinCanada.caAboutAdvertiseContact UsAndroidinCanada.caCanadian Cellphone Plan Comparison ToolCopyright © iPhone in Canada Blog"
