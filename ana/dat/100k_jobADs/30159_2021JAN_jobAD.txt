I had to send a letter into medical indicating why I use the medication Lunesta (sleeping pill). My doctors note cleared it and my medical states completed as of today. My BI has been in the security office since December and I was wondering would the BI wait until i was cleared medically as I had to send additional information?FLCPCBP0 (FL OTHER LOC)TEST - 7/21/08 (89)TO - 9/12/08VBT - 9/25/08: PASSEDFIT TEST - 10/5/08: PASSEDGS-7 11/14/08DT - 10/29/08 PASSEDMet with BI in November 2008.MEDICAL - 4/1/09 CLEAREDBACKGROUND - IN SECURITY OFFICEIEATEST - 5/26/09 (TAMPA)CommentPostCancelmerlin436Forum MemberJoin Date: Mar 2005Posts: 3197ShareTweet#1008504-01-2009, 04:45 PMOriginally posted by AlmostDone View PostHarsh generalization, you know i've been reading your posts for a long time now.

I had to send a letter into medical indicating why I use the medication LunestaI have a friend who recently applied for CBP and had gotten divorced a few years ago. At th time he used a certain anti-depression med which he reported on both his med exam and BI. They cleared roughly 3 mos. apart, but was then dropped from the hiring pool because the meds were not prescribed to him. It seems that the BI process is completely seperate but they do go over your completed med examCommentPostCancelsoto2635Forum MemberJoin Date: Feb 2009Posts: 239ShareTweet#1008704-01-2009, 06:00 PMjudt finish my medical , one more check in the book\"Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference.

Some people here on base brush off physical fitness and by the time they get here, they can't pass the physical battery. Personally, there should be no reason what so ever that any new student can't pass a 16:30 1.5 mile run. It's a joke to be quite honest, there I said it. All new hires are strongly encouraged to stay in top shape prior to arrival. Other agencies here on base have way stricter standards. If you can't make staying fit one of your top priority, I have nothing left to say....CommentPostCancelaudi0xpl0deForum MemberJoin Date: Jan 2002Posts: 1073ShareTweet#1009404-01-2009, 08:35 PMOriginally posted by DLA View Postyo so how is that verizon card for your laptop working out? my roommate is in your class and bought a macbook before he left and asked me to ask you how well it's working. any other updates while you're there will also be appreciated.. such as rooming situations, food, so on..Wireless card actually works great, although it's expensive.
