I am happy that someone took a chance on mebecause before that I had taken 15 years off to raise kids as afull-time mom. However, I am feeling that my job has turned into a bitof a grind. I am not nearly enthusiastic about the work as I expectedto be. However, I am working with fun colleagues. It is also close tomy home and they have given me flexible hours. My question to you isshould I make a jump to a more fulfilling role or is it too early?A: Congrats on re-entering the workforce successfully. Somecompanies realize the value and talent of women who have taken some timeoff to raise kids, but then want to return to work once their childrenbecome a bit more self-sufficient.It sounds like there are a lot of positives about your current job –they probably provided some training early on when you first startedworking there six months ago, they have offered you flexible work hours(which is sometimes as valuable as how they compensate you) and thecommute seems reasonable (a perk especially during the winter months).However, the work doesn’t seem as challenging or as interesting as youexpected. Six months is not a long time to stay in one job.However, Ido have a possible solution. You had mentioned it is a large company.Larger companies often post internal opportunities to encourageemployees to move within the organization. Is there an internal jobposting system that you could check periodically? The job postingsystem may require that you remain in your current role for 6, 9 or even12 months. It may be a good option because your commute would continueto be reasonable and your benefits would remain intact. However, youshould check whether any new role offers a flexible work schedule. Thatbenefit may not continue with your next role. The company wouldprobably view the transfer favorably because they have retained you insome capacity.Check out internal opportunities first. If internal opportunitiesare not available, you can start exploring opportunities elsewhere buttry to continue with your current employer for one year.Pattie Hunt Sinacole is a human resources expert and works for First Beacon Group in Hopkinton, an HR consulting firm.
