I had interview yesterday and the position was a bit different than what was explained to me on phone. I'm not 100% sure it's the right fit, but still want to send a proper thank-you note, without taking myself out of the running completely. How much do you sell yourself in the thank you if you're questioning the fit of the job? Our Twitter Advice Project (T.A.P.) is no longer an active campaign.
