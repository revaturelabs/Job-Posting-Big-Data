Isn’t a job at an institution or private sector better at that stage?They did interview few seasoned peoplewill they hire this year?Being a wage slave in the private sector and having your actual work hours monitored is never better than pulling in $250-300k for 10 hours of work per week. Also, at least UMD is near an actual city instead of the desolate wastelands such as Illinois, Penn State, Florida, Iowa, Wisconsin (just thinking of some other state schools that I'd rather be dead than live near). Of course you could pick the fabulous cities of Chicago or Baltimore and get shot on your way to evening classes.3 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economistccb8hmmm3 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economistc13aIs UMD really a sinking ship?3 months ago # QUOTE 4 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist1823What is wrong at UMD?

Based on their own rules, had SK started at UMD he would have been demoted tenure after going up in the Fall 2018. And instead they hired him. So they hired somebody who by their own rules would have not been promoted and should have left by 2018.

I have only heard of two people on that list looking actively to move, one for personal reasons and one to get a reset. In fairness, others getting offers means the department is active, visible, and doing well, if anything.Send Post »Markup: a blockquote code em strong ul ol li.Economics Job Market Rumors | Job Market | Conferences | Employers | Journal Submissions | Links | Privacy | Contact | Night ModeDefault Personality Textbook In the Club Rouge Mod Old Krug New Krug Kentucky NuSchool UKAP Sturmy Weather Not Brogues The Real Cambridge Lee Kuan Blue Beethoven Honkers Tokyo Drift Concert Hall Don't Pluck with the Chuck Troll Farm"
