If so then we want you!”“You roll, we’ll time you. If you’re the fastest and make the prettiest spliff, then we’ll keep you.”Again, the company stress that it “discourages anyone from attempting to bring any prohibited substances on to our premises”.“Our aim as a company is to promote holistic health, utilising the benefits of legal hemp and cannabinoid derived products,” a spokesperson said.Smoking is more unhealthy than vaping, they go on to say, but “we feel that if someone has to smoke, combusting and inhaling pure healing herbs rather than tobacco is an advantageous choice.”If your eyes are lighting up at the prospect of professionally rolling joints, don’t quit the day job quite yet – it’ll only be a few hours every week at £10 an hour.But if you’ve got the skills, it could be a nice little money making joint in more ways than one.Image: UnsplashLatestTechHands on: Honor MagicBook 14 review - 5 things to knowFind out what we thought of Honor’s latest laptop.TechHonor MagicWatch 2 review - 7 things to knowEverything you need to know about Honor’s new smartwatch.TechHands on: Honor 9X review - 7 things to know before you buyEverything you need to know about Honor’s latest phoneRelated Reviews and ShortlistsLaptopsBest MacBook alternatives for 2021: great Mac replacementsReady to ditch Apple?
