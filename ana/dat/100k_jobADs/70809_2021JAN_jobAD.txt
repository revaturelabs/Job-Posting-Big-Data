This project is in collaboration with the Mandel Lab (Computer and Information Science) at CUNY Brooklyn, the Brinkman Lab (Human Dimensions of Wildlife) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Liston Lab (Hydrology and Atmospheric Science) at Colorado State University.The overall goal of the project is to understand the influence of both environmental dynamics and increasing anthropogenic activity on the behavior and phenology of migratory caribou, waterfowl, and songbird communities in Arctic-boreal Alaska and northwestern Canada. The Postdoc will focus on exploring multi-scale drivers of spatial and temporal dynamics in avian migration timing (spring and fall) and pan-breeding season habitat use. This will entail working to mesh and co-analyze the avian acoustic metrics produced by the Mandel Lab, environmental data generated by the Liston Lab, and datasets on a suite of habitat characteristics and disturbance recovery from remote sensing and field observations. Applicants with experience in spatial ecology and strong analytical skills are encouraged to apply.Internal Number: 3911Create a Job Alert for Similar JobsAbout Columbia UniversityColumbia University is one of the world's most important centers of research and at the same time a distinctive and distinguished learning environment for undergraduates and graduate students in many scholarly and professional fields.
