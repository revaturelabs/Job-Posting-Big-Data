Okay, not a board room table, it was a bar room table. There was water. Okay, that’s a lie, but it was a clear liquid in the glass. And two awesome guys (100% accurate) were talking about their industry and how they could do things differently.Welltraxx was the brainchild of two small-town Saskatchewan boys, Casey Ziegler and Kris Bower. The two were professional land agents that saw an opportunity to help make life simpler for those managing oil and gas development. They wanted to assist farmers, ranchers and rural municipalities with their oil and gas holdings to ensure they got organized and stayed organized.Fast forward ten years later and Welltraxx now has two offices, one in Eastend, Saskatchewan and the other in Medicine Hat, Alberta. Every year they help hundreds of landowners across Western Canada manage their oil and gas holdings in a clear and organized manner. Over 30 Saskatchewan rural municipalities rely on their innovative software and administrative support to better connect with their energy company partners. And they work closely with several Alberta Metis settlements to help meet their specialized needs when it comes to surface lease management, oil and gas administration, consultation and more.Welltraxx is here to help you stay well connected.Read MoreBC Jobs Online Inc.Suite 101 - 887 Great Northern WayVancouver, British Columbia V5T 4T5CanadaJobs by CityCalgary JobsEdmonton JobsLethbridge JobsRed Deer JobsFort Mcmurray JobsGrande Prairie JobsLegal JobsSexsmith JobsAirdrie JobsSt. Albert JobsView allJobs by CategoryRestaurants and Food Service JobsRetail JobsBanking, Finance and Insurance JobsSales and Marketing JobsCustomer Service and Support JobsLaw Enforcement and Security JobsManagement and Executive JobsAccounting JobsInformation Technology JobsManufacturing and Production JobsView allJobs by TypeFull Time JobsPart Time JobsContract JobsView allEmployer Directory | About Us | Contact Us | Terms of Service | Employer FAQ | Site Map | API | PodcastCopyright © 2021 BC Jobs Online Inc.Partner Sites: Canadian Job Bank | BCjobs.ca"
