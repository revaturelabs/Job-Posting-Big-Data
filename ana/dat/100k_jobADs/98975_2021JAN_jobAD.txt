He is on medication that makes him have to urinate often, so he cannot be left alone while I'm at work. He is potty trained, and needs to go out every 2 hours. He is a very mellow dog, who loves other dogs and children. I am a teacher, so you would not have to watch him on major holidays and any times schools are closed. I am looking for someone to care for him in their own home, between the hours of 7 am- 4:30 pm, so you'd have to be located close or be willing to pick him up from my house.Sitter Needed For 1 Dog In WaynePart TimeWayne family needs a part-time sitter for 1 dog.
