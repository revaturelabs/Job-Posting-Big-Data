In hearing from a wide range of people ‚Äì from the established to those just finding their feet ‚Äì we‚Äôre hoping to create open discussion around money, including learnings, failures and successes. For the first in the series, we hear from a London-based illustrator who graduated in 2016. Their journey is a reminder to ensure that a supporting job doesn‚Äôt totally take over from your creative practice. After leaving a full-time position last year, we find out how they‚Äôre rebuilding confidence, laying new foundations and the realities of earning when you‚Äôre starting over.My annual income from commissions in 2018 was about ¬£5k. This was from a mixture of jobs that were primarily music or film-focused, and in-house work, mainly in children‚Äôs edutainment. This is the least I‚Äôve earned since graduating in 2016 ‚Äì but because I decided to quit my side job at the beginning of that year, to take a step back and concentrate of personal projects, I expected this. It is definitely not nearly enough to live on in London, so my savings helped a bit and to be honest, I don‚Äôt really spend a lot of money on myself.I‚Äôm yet to reach a level of freelancing where I could give an average of how much I earn, due to the inconsistency of jobs. A low month could literally be nothing because recently I have been trying to build on my personal projects so that I can add to my portfolio. A good month when I‚Äôm working in-house could be around ¬£2,400, depending on what company I‚Äôm working with, and how much my daily rate is for that particular place.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a crime to ask for more money or negotiate rates.‚ÄùMy earnings continue to evolve as I gain knowledge and confidence in my work, so that I can charge without feeling undeserving. The biggest learnings so far have been starting to identify my worth, so when it comes to pricing, I‚Äôm not confused or hesitant. Also, I now know that it‚Äôs not a crime to ask for more money or negotiate rates. I was scared the first time I did this, but the worst thing that can happen is that they say no. My first attempt at asking for more actually successful, so it encouraged me to take more risks.I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad thing to have a side job to supplement your creative work, but it‚Äôs important not to get lost. My side job was working as a specialist at an Apple store, but I ended up doing a lot of overtime and it sapped any energy I had to create. Physically and mentally I became exhausted. When I first got the job, I told myself that if I was there for more than a year, it would mean I wasn‚Äôt trying hard enough as an illustrator, so I should quit. Many months later it didn‚Äôt feel like a side job anymore, and I was barely freelancing.After a trip to Sweden with some friends, I came back to work and asked myself, ‚ÄúWhat am I actually doing?‚Äù The money was decent but the job itself wasn‚Äôt helping me. I wasn‚Äôt making a plan and it worried me how little I was drawing. So when it got to one year exactly of working there, I handed in my notice. It was a big risk but I knew it had to be done, and it pushed me to get serious with illustration again.I think the stage I‚Äôm at right now is preparation and laying down foundations. I am still working on a few commissions and consistently creating but I‚Äôm also in the process of building a new brand. My goal is to reassess and make sure my visual language is professional but still embodies my personal aesthetic, so that I can re-emerge and get the jobs I want.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a bad thing to have a side job to supplement your creative work, but it‚Äôs important not to get lost.‚ÄùSomething I‚Äôm learning is that it‚Äôs a bad idea to take on a job when your heart isn‚Äôt in it. If you know this in yourself, and know you won‚Äôt be comfortable boldly including it in your portfolio, it‚Äôs often not worth it. Now all my ventures are illustration and storytelling-related. I try to make sure I do not accept any and every job just because of the money; I have to be genuinely interested in a project.I think it‚Äôs important for freelancers and those starting out to invest in their business whenever possible. Don‚Äôt be too scared to pay out for things, because money comes, and money goes. When you have the mentality of investing in yourself, it also motivates you to do better; the positive and proactive behaviour will bring about growth....With our Money Talks series, we‚Äôre sharing experiences from creatives on the topic of earning and finances ‚Äì from successes to failures and everything in between.
