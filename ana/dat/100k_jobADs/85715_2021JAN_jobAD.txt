"New Job, Different Place – Richard Seroter's Architecture MusingsSearchRichard Seroter's Architecture MusingsBlog Featuring Code, Thoughts, and Experiences with Software and ServicesMenuSkip to contentAboutMy Pluralsight CoursesContact MeNew Job, Different Placeby Richard SeroterPosted on May 30, 2012 May 31, 2012Time to mix it up. I’ve been in enterprise IT for 5+ years, and while I’ve enjoyed it immensely and been fortunate to work at a great company, there are other things that I want to be able to do.So, I’ve decided to quit my job, and accept an offer with Tier 3. I’ll be a Product Manager and contribute to product strategy while writing/speaking about cloud computing and how to take advantage of IaaS and PaaS platforms. I’m excited to focus all my attention on cloud computing and get the opportunity work at a place that will compete and collaborate with some of the leading companies in this exploding space.Tier 3, included in Gartner’s recent Magic Quadrant for Public Cloud Infrastructure as a Service, has an excellent enterprise cloud infrastructure platform and a fascinating Cloud Foundry-based platform-as-a-service offering called Web Fabric. I’ve written about Iron Foundry (the open source technology beneath Web Fabric) a few times in the past, and really think that Tier 3 made a smart move bringing .NET developers into the popular Cloud Foundry ecosystem. Besides working with cool technology, I’m most excited about working with Adam, Jared, Wendy, Adron and all the supremely talented people at this up-and-coming company.I’ll stay in Southern California and travel up to Tier 3’s headquarters in Bellevue, WA every month or so. Tier 3 is completely supportive of my blogging, writing, InfoQ contribution, MS MVP activities, Pluralsight training, speaking engagements, and other random community activities. So, expect more of the same from me!Share this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookRedditEmailLike this:Like Loading...RelatedPosted in Cloud, Cloud Foundry	Author: Richard SeroterRichard Seroter is Director of Outbound Product Management at Google Cloud, with a master’s degree in Engineering from the University of Colorado.
