Every year, about 80 untoward incidents are reported every year by the United States Coast Guard, Australia, and other countries in the region.Some sharks are harmless to humans. The great white shark is one example. Many sharks attack and then retreat when they are attacked. Although most sharks have no problem with humans (aside from being afraid of humans), there are some species that do have a problem with them.There are two types of shark that attack humans. One is the “killer shark” (which is the most deadly variety of shark) and the other is the “non-lethal” shark, which is the least fatal variety of shark. Both varieties are deadly to humans.A “killer shark” is a large shark with sharp teeth and a venomous bite. It is often mistaken for a common octopus because it is so closely related to that fish and can reach more than twelve feet long. They are extremely aggressive and have been known to be responsible for hundreds of fatal attacks worldwide.A “non-lethal” shark, also known as a “killer shark,” is a shark that does not cause any injury or death to humans. Most non-lethal shark attacks occur because the shark accidentally strikes the swimmer, causing minor damage, such as bruises or minor cuts, which the swimmer can recover from with proper medical treatment.A “non-lethal” shark can cause death if it bites a swimmer in the head, but even the shark itself is unlikely to do this. The reason is that most sharks have a special layer of fat under their skin, which prevents them from having any type of muscle in the area to pinch into when they bite. The human skull contains more muscle than the skin of any other part of the body, making the chances of the shark being able to pinch into this area extremely slim.The best way to protect yourself from a “non-lethal” shark is to avoid swimming near them. Although most attacks occur when swimmers are not near a swimming pool, sharks do occasionally attack swimmers if they swim into deep waters. This type of shark attacks are not fatal but can cause serious injury and should be avoided.One other thing you can do to prevent a shark attack is to swim in groups of at least three people when you are near sharks. Although it may seem a bit silly, swimmers are much more likely to be bitten if there are too many sharks around.The “killer” shark is a slightly larger shark, often over twenty feet long, but not as large as the octopus or the bull shark. They do not cause any harm to humans but can inflict severe pain on a swimmer when provoked. Their primary prey is people who are swimming close to their mouths. Attacks by the killer shark can cause sever injuries and sometimes death.The “non-lethal” shark is not a threat to humans but is still dangerous if a swimmer becomes stuck underwater with it. These sharks will attack swimmers who come into proximity to their prey without provocation. Because these sharks are rarely aggressive, they are rarely involved in attacks in the water.Sharks are more likely to bite swimmers in shallow waters where their prey is hard to spot. They can hide in the shadows of rocks or reefs. Because they cannot see their prey very well, they tend to take their chances in areas where they can hide.If you see a shark close to your swimmer, the best thing to do is to swim away and leave it alone, and if it is too close to land, try to swim away while it is not attacking your swimmer. Swimming too far away can cause the shark to return to the area to seek revenge, which is why swimming away should always be a last resort.Although sharks may appear frightening to some, they are really very harmless and will not hurt a person unless provoked. While swimming close to a shark can be scary, if you are attacked by one, never try to fight back.about shark attackslearn about shark attacksshark attacks	Share FacebookTwitterGoogle+ReddItWhatsAppPinterestEmailPrev Post	Getting Started With WordPress TrainingNext PostAbout Eye ContactYou might also like More from authorEntertainmentOriginal Mobile Suit Gundam anime series now streaming on Crunchyroll	EntertainmentGTA Online publisher smacks down another cheat seller	EntertainmentSteve Harvey has his eye on daughter’s boyfriend, Michael B.
