You recall the attack on Chick-Fil-A because of statements that Dan Cathy, president and COO of Chick-Fil-A, made about homosexual marriage:“It has been just over a year since Chicago Alderman Proco “Joe” Moreno and Mayor Rahm Emanuel first took a stand against the privately owned food chain Chick-Fil-A, due to the owner Dan Cathy’s Christian faith and unfavorable view of same-sex marriage.”Moreno is trying to hold up a $57 million car dealership development because he wants the dealership to be Hispanic-owned. It just so happens that the proposed dealership would be owned by conservative Republicans.As a result, a store that was going to be built in the Chicago area never happened. A number of colleges also refused to allow the restaurant to open on campus. The result? Lost jobs and income.Trending: Why Michele Bachmann is Wrong about Her Claim that “Jesus is Coming Soon”The site where a Chick-Fil-A restaurant was going to be built remains a vacant lot “with no more than a pile of rubble and overgrown weeds, bordered by a dilapidated and incomplete chain link fence. It is estimated that as many as 200 temporary and permanent, full and part-time jobs could have been affected by Alderman Moreno’s actions.” A typical restaurant employees “more than 60 team members.”This doesn’t count the service industries that work with the restaurant chain.Let’s not forget the Oregon bakery that closed its doors because of harassment from homosexuals because the owners refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. Any other cake would have been fine. Can you imagine if the KKK had gone to a bakery owned by a black couple and requested a Ku Klux Klan-themed cake?Peter Vidmar, a double gold-medal winner in the 1984 Olympics in gymnastics, was forced to resign as Chairman of USA Gymnastics. Why? Because in 2008 he donated $2000 to support Proposition 8. The homosexual defamation machine went into action and put pressure on the Olympic Committee and its sponsors. The blacklist lives!A letter writer to the San Francisco Chronicle who supported Prop 8 was intimidated when Internet search engines were used “to find the letter writer’s small business, his Web site (which included the names of his children and dog), his phone number and his clients. And they posted that information in the ‘Comments’ section of SFGate.com — urging, in ugly language, retribution against the author’s business and its identified clients.”A San Antonio, Texas, same-sex ordinance will have the effect of discriminating against job applicants because of their views on same-sex sex.Senior Master Sergeant Phillip Monk, who served as a First Sergeant at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, and is a 19-year veteran, was punished by his commander for declining to affirm homosexual marriage.Homosexuals are calling for a boycott of Orson Scott Card’s film version of Ender’s Game because of Card’s anti-same-sex views.Gay organization Geeks Out wants people to skip the Summit film [that will be released in November 2013]. “Do not buy a ticket at the theater, do not purchase the DVD, do not watch it on-demand. Ignore all merchandise and toys. However much you may have admired his books, keep your money out of Orson Scott Card’s pockets,” the organization writes on its “Skip Ender’s Game” website.There you have it. The more same-sex sexual ethic move through society, the more jobs and freedoms are lost. Remember when people said that homosexual marriage is an issue that doesn’t affect them?0shareShareTweetFlipboardPrevious postBloomberg Pulls Race Card on Candidate Who’s Married to a Black WomanNext postGestapo-Like Initiative Becomes Law in San AntonioLatest ArticlesOpinionWhere to View Gary DeMar’s Daily ArticlesOpinion‘Socialism for Thee but not for Me’OpinionDoes the Bible Teach that the World Will End?OpinionThe State’s Goal is to Control the FamilyOpinionRuled by God’s Laws or Ruled by the Dictates of the StateOpinionThe ‘What Ifs’ of History and What Might Have BeenOpinionJohn Piper, the Coronavirus, and the End TimesGary DeMarCopyright ©, All Rights Reserved.SHARE‘Gay’ Rights Initiatives Mean a Loss of Jobs and Freedoms"
