Whether you have a large backyard or one that is simple, small and enclosed, we’re willing to bet that it is under-used, so what can be done to make it more usable?We have taken a look at three excellent ideas that will encourage you to make more use of the outdoors, and what could be better than enjoying the sun in your own personal outdoor living space? So, here are our ideas – start with these, and you’ll soon have a great outdoor living space that you can enjoy to the fullest.Lay a DeckAll the rage at the moment – and with good reason – decking should be the first thing you consider if you want to transform your outdoor space into a viable living area. You might think it expensive, but in fact it is one of the most cost-effective methods of bringing alive an outdoor area. Whether you have a simple courtyard-type space or a larger garden area, a decking space either attached to the house or in a separate part of the yard has many advantages: it is easy to keep clean, rainwater drains from it, and will be a great place with heaters installed for use in even the winter evenings.You can install decking yourself – there are many videos online that tell you how – but we strongly recommend that you check out local providers as a professional job will give you better results, and you may be surprised how affordable it will be.Add a GazeboThe sun is beautiful, warm – and dangerous! Even with ultra-levels of sun screen on your skin, it’s still possible to get too much sun, and if you’re one of those people who suffer from the heat, some shade is always welcome. So, in addition to your beautiful new deck, why not add a gazebo?These affordable and very practical items take the form of an open-sided tent – although there are many you can buy with optional side screens for protection against the wind – and are easy to set up and take down. So, you can choose whether you want to have a permanent gazebo or one that can be used only when necessary, and there are some surprisingly attractive models on the market, too. It’s worth having a look around at the different sizes, and perhaps picking one that covers a portion of your deck and leaves the rest open to the sun.Build a Fire PitGreat for those evenings in the fall when the nights become a little cooler, a fire pit is an excellent addition to your back yard. It’s one for the adults, of course, but keep the kids at a safe distance and they can enjoy it too. It’s easy to do: clear a nice flat area – preferably close to your decking so you get the full effect – and build a circular wall with bricks. It’s best to cement them in place if you want it to be a decent one.Leave a few holes in the wall for the air to get through and build it to a sensible height so that you can drop wood in – and you have a great fire pit for added warmth on cooler nights, meaning your outdoor space is more usable than ever!These are just a few of the ideas we came up with for making your outdoor space more usable, and we reckon there are many more, so make up a list and you’ll soon enjoy the backyard more than you ever thought you could.Tia, and TipsfromTia.com is trying to keep you looking good andfeeling good, from the inside out.

As a homeowner, you should know that you’re more than capable of completing a whole host of jobs by yourself. Still, this doesn’t mean you should dismiss the benefits of using experts at various stages during your homeownership. Sometimes, those smart investments can make all the difference.Here are just four incidents where going it alone could backfire spectacularly. Find out more about the best services available, and you will reap a whole host of benefits.Moving InMoving home is one of the most exciting experiences that you’ll ever enjoy. However, there’s no doubt that it can be extremely stressful too. Especially if you don’t support yourself in style.Even if this isn’t your first move, your experiences of this task are very limited. Therefore, finding a professional removalist can be one the smartest steps of all. Their help reduces the stress, offers a practical solution to transporting big items, and can be financially sensible. Perfect.Given that you’ll have already used agents and property surveyors to great effect, missing out on this service would be very foolish indeed.Upgrading Home TechnologyBy now, most homeowners can appreciate the influence that tech gadgets can bring to the home. Furthermore, the vast majority will want to embrace a variety of those features.While many people are capable of installing modern TVs and utilizing appliances, some items are best left to the pros. Creating a smarter home will enhance your life greatly, but only if the facilities are installed in the right fashion. Get it wrong, and things will become worse than before.In most situations, the work completed will be one-time investments. So, there needn’t be any thoughts of wasted money.Source: With a little support, you home can be dragged into 2018Repairing DamageThere’s no escaping the fact that things go wrong inside the modern home. These can range from the seemingly small items to severe problems. Either way, restoring normality is key.When there’s a serious leak in the home, an emergency plumber is your best bet. This simply isn’t an aspect of homeownership where you can afford to take risks. For similar reasons, electricians and builders are crucial contacts to possess.The longer you leave the damage untreated, the worse it will become. For the sake of your comfort, finances, and emotions, the expert touch is best.Improving RoomsSome homeowners will use the professionals for all decorating and interior design upgrades. Even if you aren’t one of them, the bigger projects require a pro.Converting the garage or guest room to a home gym or office may be within your capabilities.
