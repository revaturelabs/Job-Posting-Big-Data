We have opportunities for relief, part-time and full-time veterinarian positions.SpayToday Healthy Pet Center is a registered Colorado 501c3 non-profit organization located in Lakewood, just outside of Denver, and has been in operation since 2009, providing low-cost spay/neuter services to the community, including pet owners and rescue organizations. We do approximately 8,000 surgeries per year in addition to vaccines, microchips, heartworm and combo testing. Our days and hours of operation are Tuesday-Saturday, 7 am-5 pm, though the veterinarian is typically able to leave between 3-3:30 each day scheduled. No evenings or emergency on-call.For relief, the ideal candidate(s) will be those with experience in high quality, high-volume spay/neuter, though if there is a consideration for part/full time, we are willing to train the right person who has some current spay/neuter experience. Experience with other surgical procedures helpful, as we remove deciduous teeth and rear dewclaws and repair umbilical hernias, in addition to occasional other minor soft tissue surgeries. There is minimal client interaction, although there are times when you will need to talk directly to clients regarding risks of surgery for their pets, etc. and see patients for occasional rechecks if there are any client post-op concerns with surgery. We also offer appointment based basic vaccination and testing appointments several afternoons a week and there may be opportunities to help expand our wellness services, providing low-cost exams and preventative care for animals in our community.We have a very strong team, performing 25-50 surgeries per day (dogs, cats and rabbits) with 1-2 doctors in surgery each day and a staff of 5-7 veterinary technicians and assistants. We have very specific safety protocols in place to make sure that the pets we serve are cared for in the best way possible. We want each owner to know that their pet is important and will receive the safest and most competent care with us. We have a surgery suite with three surgery tables, each one supplied with its own anesthetic unit (O2 and Isoflurane), monitoring devices including pulse-oximeter, CO2 readings, HR and RR. There are two prep tables and there is a surgery technician monitoring surgery patients at all times and a specifically trained technician responsible for monitoring all patients in recovery each day.SpayToday’s Medical Director serves on the Colorado State Board of Veterinary Medicine and makes sure that our veterinary care and paperwork meet the State Board requirements for record-keeping and standard of care, as required by the Colorado Veterinary Practice Act. This is critical to patient care and also helps protect our veterinarians when it comes to appropriate medical record requirements. We are very proud of our extremely high standard of care in this industry!While we are growing and reaching more people in our community for low cost spay/neuter and quality wellness care, we need a veterinarian who wants to join a team of professionals committed to helping people and animals---this is our mission!
