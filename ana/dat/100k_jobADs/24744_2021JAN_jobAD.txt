Their remarks greatly upset my friend.Society at large seems very unforgiving and lacks empathy and compassion.Instead of giving jobseekers a helping hand, some gloat at their misfortune and failures.This adds to the despair and disillusionment these professionals, managers, engineers and technicians in their 40s and 50s feel, as they struggle to raise their families without employment and stable incomes.I have encountered a fair number who have contemplated suicide.Employers should endeavour to give a second chance to jobseekers who have suffered countless setbacks in their careers, if circumstances permit.Adding insult to injury or rubbing salt into their wounds simply does not alter the situation, and benefits no one.Joe Teo Kok SeahJoin ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.Topics:TODAY'S LETTERSPME/PMETMoreWhatsapp Linkedin FB Messenger Telegram Reddit WeChat Pinterest Print Purchase Article Copy permalinkhttp://str.sg/4xUSThe Straits TimesAvailable foriPhones and iPadsAvailable inGoogle PlayBack to the topE-paperFacebookInstagramTwitterPodcastsRSS FeedTelegramYoutubeSingaporeAsiaWorldOpinionLifeBusinessTechSportVideosPodcastsMultimediaTerms & ConditionsData Protection PolicyNeed help?
