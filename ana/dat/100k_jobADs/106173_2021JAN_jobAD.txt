Dental assistants are typically responsible for directly supporting dentists to ensure that procedures run smoothly. They manage equipment such as suction hoses to keep the patient’s mouth dry and workable during treatment, sterilize instruments, and develop X-rays/perform other lab tasks under dentist oversight. Additionally, they coordinate with clients to deliver information on effective hygiene techniques, schedule appointments, and arrange billing/payment. Because many of their tasks involve interaction with dentists and patients, they need to have strong interpersonal skills.Depending on state regulations, dental assistants may perform coronal polishing to eliminate soft deposits, protect teeth from cavities with sealant or fluoride, and/or prepare patients for procedures by applying topical anesthetic. Some are also expected to prepare materials for temporary crowns and casts of teeth.Search Dental Assistant JobsAll Dental Assistant Dental Hygienist Dental Lab Technician Dental Sales Representative Dentist - General Practitioner Endodontist Office Manager / Practice Administrator/Receptionist Oral / Maxillofacial Surgeon Oral Surgery Assistant Orthodontist Pediatric Dentist Periodontist Prosthodontist Treatment Coordinator1-15 of 41 JobsCertified Orthodontic AssistantOGDEN ORTHODONTICS - Windermere, FL 34786, FL (12 miles from Apopka, FL)We have an immediate opening for a Certified Orthodontic Assistant in our Mount Dora and Windermere locations.
