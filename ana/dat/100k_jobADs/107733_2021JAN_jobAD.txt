From the initial enquiry to the supply of three dedicated hard working and adaptable staff your dedication has been second to none. All of the staff supplied were excellent from day one – well done to them and your company.Commercial Gas EngineerAs an heating engineer looking for employment I contacted a number of employment agencies to help me find work. Multitask stood out from the rest, the staff were very helpful and friendly they showed an interest in finding me work and always kept me informed about all the job leads and vacancies. I was surprised at the level of service they provided me and it didnt take long before multitask found me the job i was looking for.That was late 2010 and im still working for the same company in a permenant position that i enjoy. Thanks Claire and all the staff at Multitask.Contract ManagerI found the big difference between Multitask and other agencies was the fact that Multitask actually wanted to match me with the role rather than just fill the position.Utilities CompanyOperationsI have worked with Claire and the team at Multitask for the last 6 months, and although I have asked her to complete some highly challenging recruitment the team at Multitask has delivered time and again. Over the years I have worked with a number of agencies with similar offerings and I would rate the services at Multitask as some of the most flexible and consistent experienced to date …Our CompanyWe believe that because we are an independent recruitment business and are not a large national recruitment provider, we can provide a far more flexible service for our customers, tailoring our services and prices to suit your needs.More about MultitaskRegister hereRegister hereMultitask RegistrationWhy not register your details and join our database of experienced candidates.
