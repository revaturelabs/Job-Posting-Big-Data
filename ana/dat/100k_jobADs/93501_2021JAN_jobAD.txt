Specific responsibilities include research in neural engineering, teaching, and service. Appointments are available in any department in the School appropriate to the candidate’s research and teaching interests, and joint appointments with the School of Medicine will be considered if appropriate. Applicants must hold a doctoral degree in Engineering or related fields (Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or Biology) and have previous research experience in neuroengineering; a proven track record of competitive funding as PI is preferred. To be competitive for a tenured position, candidates must have an outstanding vision for independent research and be nationally recognized for their scholarship and commitment to education.The School of EngineeringThe UAB School of Engineering is dedicated to research excellence and providing the highest quality education to a diverse population of future engineers. It consists of five departments: Biomedical Engineering (joint with the UAB School of Medicine), Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering with approximately 70 faculty members and enrolls about 900 undergraduate and 500 graduate students. The School of Engineering includes six undergraduate majors in five academic departments, as well as more than 15 graduate degree programs. UAB Engineering offers highly adaptable programs that range from traditional M.S./Ph.D. pathways to online master of engineering degree tracks for working professionals. UAB Engineering offers unique opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration—not only within engineering but with other academic departments across campus and local industry.Neuroengineering and Neuroscience at UABThe Schools of Engineering and Medicine are located on the same physical campus in the heart of Birmingham, just a few minutes’ walk apart. Engineering and Medicine recently launched a joint Ph.D. program in Neuroengineering, and engineering undergraduates have the opportunity to pursue a minor in neuroengineering. Research in neuroengineering is supported by collaboration with the Departments of Neurology, Neurobiology, and Neurosurgery in the School of Medicine and with the Comprehensive Neuroscience Center, which has more than 350 members. Neuroscience research at UAB is currently supported by more than $128M in active grants. The centerpiece of the UAB Health System is the 1150-bed University Hospital, among the largest in the United States. The health care facility spans 5 city blocks, occupies 13 major buildings, and covers 2.1 million square feet of space. For outpatient care, the primary facility is The Kirklin Clinic, a five-story 454,000 square foot building that supports more than 700 physicians. Clinical neuroscience areas of strength include stroke and vascular disease, movement disorders, memory disorders, epilepsy, neuroimmunology, neuroimaging, neuromuscular disease and neuro-oncology. There are active programs in deep brain stimulation and epilepsy surgery; the functional neurosurgery group performs 250 awake craniotomies per year, providing excellent opportunities for in vivo human recording. There are also active programs in functional and molecular neuroimaging. Key NIH Center and infrastructure awards include a Morris K. Udall Center of Excellence in Parkinson’s Research, an NIA funded Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and an NIH Brain Initiative UH3 award. UAB is a site for both NeuroNEXT, the NIH network for phase II trials, and StrokeNet, which supports NIH clinical trials in stroke.The University of Alabama at BirminghamThe University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is a research university and academic health center that discovers, teaches, and applies knowledge for the intellectual, cultural, social, and economic benefit of Birmingham, the state, and beyond.
