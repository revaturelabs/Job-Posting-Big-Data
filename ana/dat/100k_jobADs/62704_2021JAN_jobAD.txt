"On the job injury – David Walker AttorneyDavid Walker AttorneyMenuSkip to contentAboutPractice AreasReviewsMediationContactOn the job injury	New Workman’s Comp LawsEffective January 1, 2017, all employers MUST report the cost of all claims for which any medical care is provided and medical costs incurred. This will now include those involving first aid treatment, even if the insurer did not make the payment. All in-force workers’ compensation policyholders will be affected by this new law beginning January 1, 2017, regardless of the policy’s effective date. This means if you cut your finger at work and require peroxide and a band aid or bang your leg and grab an ice pack and ace bandage, it will need to be reported.A recent memo from the California Department of Insurance and State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF) was sent to SCIF policyholders and Doctors. The memo said:“The definition of First Aid is ‘any one time treatment of minor scratches, cuts, burns, splinters, or other minor industrial injury.’ This definition is found in Section 5401 of the Labor Code.The law requires all physicians to complete and submit the Doctor’s First Report (Form 5021) within five (5) working days to the workers’ compensation carrier or directly to the claims administrator for the self-insured employer. This law applies to all workers’ compensation injuries, including first aid, whether or not an Employee Claim Form (DWC-1) has been filed. The Doctor’s First Report should not be sent first to the employer. To assist in this process, the employer should promptly respond to every physician’s request to identify their claims administrator.The Department of Insurance announcement, which we have enclosed, states that offending physicians and employers are subject to fraud prosecution. Therefore, State Fund urges all physicians and employers to comply with these requirements.Upon receipt of the Doctor’s First Report, State Fund will send a copy to the Department of Industrial Relations as required. At that point, State Fund will determine whether the injury/illness meets the Labor Code definition of first aid. If it does, the Doctor’s First Report will be sent to the employer along with related bills upon confirmation that the employer wishes to make payments for the first aid treatment.”As an employer, if you don’t report these to your Workers Comp carrier and you’re caught you face fines of $50 to $200 per incident. When you do report them you’ll be facing an increase in Worker’s Comp premiums as your ex-mod increases.”As an employee beware, the accident prone person may be targeted for release. And don’t try and do your employer a favor by not reporting on the job minor cuts and bruises, as you can see, there’s trouble for you both in that case.For more information, visit: https://www.workcompcentral.com/columns/show/id/g269v04o694792gh12j17eJanuary 2, 2017 December 30, 2016 David Walker Attorney Tagged Attorney, David Walker Attorney, Doctor's, First Aid, injury, Lawyer, New Laws, On the job injury, Workman's Comp	Leave a commentWidgetsSearch for:Recent PostsMutt’s DayA Tribute to My Father-In-Law DeckThe Science of Micro Facial Expressions Meets Emoji’sfamilyArnold Palmer Remains My Favorite DrinkRecent CommentsBrenna on Add a Little Wine to Your Dinn…Lucio on Add a Little Wine to Your Dinn…MakeItUltra™ on GET REAL!David Walker Attorne… on Let’s Get Plantingcarolee on Let’s Get PlantingArchivesJuly 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016November 2016October 2016September 2016August 2016July 2016June 2016May 2016April 2016March 2016February 2016January 2016December 2015CategoriesUncategorizedMetaRegisterLog inEntries feedComments feedWordPress.comStay ConnectedAboutPractice AreasReviewsContactBlog at WordPress.com.Add your thoughts here...
