We exist to support the many, not the few. In many social change contexts, people assume that if one is provided with business advice and investment, social entrepreneurship will emerge. We believe that there is a third element – equally important - the provision of transformational learning and development. Our learning programmes focus on the development of practice: the practice of leadership and the practice of entrepreneurship. We support people to turn up as their best selves. With a 16 year track record of successful delivery in Scotland, the Social Enterprise Academy has been sharing its business and learning delivery models for the past 7 years with international partners through a social licence approach.Glasgow Office24 George SquareGlasgowG2 1EGmail@senscot.net0141 280 2570Edinburgh Office21 Walker StreetEdinburghEH3 7HXmail@senscot.net0131 220 4104Latest TweetsCalling all social enterprises.
