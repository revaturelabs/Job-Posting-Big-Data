Front (from left) Dean Hyland, Chris Kettle, Amber Lutter and Rebecca Egan.Amber said it was interesting that many of the students in attendance already held a variety of part-time positions including hospitality, field work, retail and hardware attendant.“The outcome they all wanted to achieve was to ensure they had an attention-grabbing resume with all relevant skills addressed,” she said.“Quite often basic things like qualifications including being a licence holder, having attained a first aid certificate or their involvement with voluntary organisations are points missed from their resume.”Rebecca Egan, Queensland Education’s Link and Launch Officer based at Bundaberg State High School, told students she was available to receive their draft resumes to ensure the accuracy of the documents and to offer advice on possible improvements.The presenters highlighted to students the dangers of having a public Facebook page which may contain inappropriate material or images.Rebecca said it was one of the first places employers looked for information regarding a potential employee.“If you have a Facebook page you really need to ensure it is appropriate,” Rebecca said.Isis High student Kurt Mackay said he had found the information from the panellists very useful.“I’m looking at some form of part-time work initially because I would like to buy a car. Then perhaps I may be looking for a trade based apprenticeship like an electrician.”He said he understood that employers received multiple applications for advertised jobs and having a resume that concisely showcased his abilities was one way of gaining the attention of a potential employer.Chris Kettle said applicants should never feel discouraged if they receive a “no” when making a job application. “Look at ‘no’ as simply meaning ‘next opportunity’,” he said.Other news: Discover the universe in VR at Bundaberg LibraryMigrant hostel memories displayed at Hinkler HallBurnett Heads residents connect through coffeeTagsChilderseducationjobsMore community newsCommunityChilders kids slide into active summer fun20 January 2021There will be plenty of healthy fun for kids on Thursday at a Keep Kids Active session at the Childers Showgrounds from 9.30am to 11.30am.Read moreNewsFirst stage of Isis Highway safety upgrade to start14 January 2021Work will start this week on the first stage of a $42.5 million Isis Highway safety upgrade that will deliver wider centre lines and audio-tactile linemarking.Read moreAgricultureAgProspects program open to enter farm jobs8 January 2021The successful AgProspects program to help Bundaberg Region residents into farm jobs has been extended after positive early results.Read moreCommunity newsVeteran cricketers batting on a good wicket22 January 2021Rising Reds mix with BUSHKids in Bundaberg22 January 2021Indoor Plant Drop craze blossoms in Bundaberg21 January 2021Spotted Dog and Federal fire response recognised20 January 2021Childers kids slide into active summer fun20 January 2021Recent CommentsAnya Aventante on Dockside on Quay draws local and interstate interestRodney Jones on Dockside on Quay draws local and interstate interestBrian on Shopping complex proposed for Rifle Range RoadCONNECT27,701FansLike4,005FollowersFollow136FollowersFollow61SubscribersSubscribeAbout usBundaberg Now is a free community website delivering good news online — an initiative of Bundaberg Regional Council.Contact us: here.Follow usFacebookInstagramLinkedinTwitterYoutubeThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.AboutAuthorsComments policyContactPrivacy policy>MORE STORIESVIP Defence Academy experience for Jack Brophy4 September 2019Bargara Carols by Candlelight delights for 19 years14 December 2019"
