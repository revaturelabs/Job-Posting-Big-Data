"Why I Fucking Hate the Corporate Job | Anand Giani LifestyleHomeFree VideosGet StartedAboutBlogMy YouTube ChannelContactSearchMenuMindset, MoneyWhy I Fu*&king Hate The Corporate JobAFTER WORKING IN THE CORPORATE FINANCE WORLD for 13 years, I wanted to list out those pain points which has drove me mad and encouraged me to look for an alternative way of working. I’m sure some or all of these will resonate with you!The Daily GrindHaving to conform to working hours just doesn’t stick with me. You have to arrange your life around the 9am-5pm workday and sometimes longer. Each day feels like groundhog day with your only respite being a vacation or a sick day. Even after that you’re back into the usual grove – or should I say rut!Don’t get me wrong, it’s good to have a schedule and a certain amount of predictability in your life, but wouldn’t you rather work flexibly, waking up as you choose and during hours that suit you?No winning with bossesI’ve had my fair share of bosses during my time! Some are complete assholes, some are smiley but assholes and others are just a drip. I’ve had bosses that say one thing, but then change tack later and expect you to have known what they’re thinking and adapt. You can either speak out and get ear-marked for no progression, or stay silent and suffer.Don’t get me wrong – I’ve had some wonderful bosses too. Men and women that see your value and let you run with projects, and let you work your own way in your own style. The key is that they trust me and know that i’ll keep them informed of my progress.But. Wouldn’t you rather be your own boss? Making your own decisions for the direction of your enterprise and not answer to anyone but you?Don’t see the value in my workThis is a particular pain point for me. I feel that it is very important that your work has an end goal, i.e. to provide value to a client, assist a colleague or to represent the progress your company has made. When I can’t make the connection between my work and how it benefits the business, clients and wider community – then I am very demotivated to perform that piece of work.Of course there will always be administrative tasks that you can’t avoid, but my gripe is with the core purpose of your job.An example of this was when I worked an Internal Auditor at a big 4 accountancy firm when I first graduated. We used to produce report after report for banks, investment firms, asset managers concluding on their risks and business controls. However we hardly scratched the surface of their business, and the recommendations we provided were just laughable! I felt so embarrassed during the closing meetings when my seniors were sharing our findings and recommendations with the client.The way I saw it was that this client has paid the firm thousands for a recommendation that says ‘must sign this document’. I couldn’t see the value we (the accountancy firm) was providing!This is why it is so important for me to be working on projects that I find fulfilling and will add value. For me, clean water is a problem for many countries around the world. I hope to one day provide a solution or product that can allow people to drink and wash with clean water.Long ass commuteAnother thing that sucks the life out of me is a long commute. Especially on the London tube network! It just eats up alot of time, not to mention rude people with no concept of personal space. I now make sure that when commuting (2 hrs door to door), that I’m making use of that time either by listening to developmental podcasts, jotting my thoughts, reading useful articles.But there’s so much more to be achieved in those 4 hours. This is another core reason why I’ve sought an online business where I can work from home and avoid that dreaded commute. The commute just takes away time from what is important to me, i.e. family, friends, fitness and my business.Lack of learning and developingWorking in a traditional economy as I have teaches you many things. What is doesn’t teach you is the skills needed for the digital economy. More and more products and services are marketed and sold on the internet, and there are so many tools and skills that I feel I was missing out on by working as a Auditor/Risk Manager/Trader/Consultant.With the digital economy surpassing the traditional economy for some sectors, it’s a matter of time before most business will be facilitated online.AND some of the skills to be learned are;Website buildingMarketingVideo creationE-commerceDeveloping and servicing leadsSEO (search engine optimization)Social media platforms for businessHaving joined the online community – SFM (Six Figure Mentors), I have already developed so many of the above skills and am still learning. I was taken through a step-by-step process to set up my online business and I am excited by the possibilities ahead, one which will include quitting my job for the reasons given above!And by the way, as an Entrepreneur you learn so much about yourself and your mindset, like how you react to adversity, pressure, what motivates you, etc. Stuff that you wouldn’t identify as an employee.If you’re also struggling with the mundane corporate world and resonate with my reasons above, I highly recommend that you join me on the path I have taken – by clicking here.I will gladly introduce you to my mentors who provide a free video series to get you up and running with your own online, profitable business.It’s an opportunity you CANNOT afford to miss out on.BestMarch 20, 2019 /0 Comments/by AnandTags: boss, commute, corporate job, corporate world, dissatisfied, employee, job, long, online business, valueShare this entryShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Google+Share on PinterestShare on LinkedinShare by Mailhttps://anandgiani.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/stressed-office-worker2.jpg 270 480 Anand https://anandgiani.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/signature5c8ad5e3853c1-1.png Anand2019-03-20 22:14:222019-08-02 14:50:50Why I Fu*&king Hate The Corporate JobYou might also likeFinding Time To Build Your Online Business8 Reasons Why You Should Use Convertri To Build Your Funnel Pages5 Online Business Models4 Realistic Ways To Make Money Online\"Why I Didn't Start My Internet Business Sooner\" - Common Excuses (And Solutions)Focus Your Thoughts (And Shift Your Outcomes)0 repliesLeave a ReplyWant to join the discussion?Feel free to contribute!Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
