He referred to RBA figures showing that construction activities in the mining sector only contributed to a 0.25% rise in employment over the last year.\"Furthermore, the income effect which was so important in the previous mining boom has not been apparent in this cycle as government, households and firms have been saving any income boost,\" he said.Evans expressed concern over the RBA's future moves, and said the RBA's tone could indicate they were ignoring current economic indicators.\"Our biggest concern is that the authorities, as implied in the Governor's statement, dismiss short-term economic weakness and continue to emphasise medium-term concerns about tight labour markets and a wealth-creating mining bonanza,\" Evans said.Follow us on Twitter for more news, tips and inspiration.Like us on Facebook and Google+ explore our Pinterest boards.Like this article or found it helpful?
