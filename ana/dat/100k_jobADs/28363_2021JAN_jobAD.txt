As robustly and intelligently produced, it deceives the viewer, as it looks like a part of the table frame when the desk is closed. The golden nose serves the function of a drawer handle embodying the surrealistic elements characterized through a fascination with the incongruous, the irrational and the bizarre. The nose is created from an aluminum injection-mold that is then coated with gold chrome plate.Contact for more informationDo you have a question about this specific product?
