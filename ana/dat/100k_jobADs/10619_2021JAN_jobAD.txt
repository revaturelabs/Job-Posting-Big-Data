Surviving the Golden Age is excited to premiere the album’s lead single, “Infinity Appetite.”“We’ve all got two wolves in us: a good one and a bad one and they both want to eat,” says the vocal sample of Matthew McConaughey that replays through “Infinity Appetite.” Besides that sample, the song is instrumental mixing elements of math rock and jazz. With the prevailing feature being strummed bass and driving drums, it is easy to draw comparisons to bands like Hella or Fucking Champs but there are quieter moments as well that sound like anything from Primus to the Law and Order theme song.Share this:RedditTwitterFacebookMoreLinkedInTumblrBioLatest PostsAdam MorganDied Tragically Rescuing His Family From The Wreckage Of A Destroyed Sinking Battleship.WebsiteTwitterLatest Posts By Adam MorganPremiere: Cass Miller “Temporary”Freedom Fry “Le Point Zéro”Sofi Gev “You’re the Star”Keep StGA Ad Free#TRENDINGVideo Rewind 02.07.2014#TuesdayTop10: Records Released on 9/11/2001Postmodernism and Hip-HopMilkblood “Sick of Being Honest”Blood Orchid “Nightshade”SHIMA featuring Miyachi “Machine”Terrell Carter & eMMber “Hero”Kishi Bashi: OmoiyariAdam Jensen “Inmate 8576”YG featuring Young Jeezy & Rich Homie Quan…BlogrollAcid StagAcid TedAudra May PhotographyCustom ButtonsFuzzy LogicGimme Tinnituship hop isn't dead.Kastor's KornerKeep the Coffee ComingNeuFutur MagazineOne ChordPost to WirePowerpopulistScranton Image MakingThe Metaphorical BoatBack to top"
