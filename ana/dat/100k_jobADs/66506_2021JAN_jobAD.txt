A former Marine, who has published many articles here, was slammed by Gordon Duff and by Jim Dean for perpetrating “a hoax” by raising concerns about this mysterious “training op” called JADE HELM. I admire VT and like Gordon personally, although from time to time we have a divergence in our point of view. I have never felt as positive about Jim Dean because, as an old-time reporter and editor, he has come across to me as having an anti-academic prejudice, which I as a former professor have sensed from our initial encounters. But that doesn’t mean he’s wrong. But let’s consider the case of this article and its author, Robert O’Dowd. Although I had not read any of his work at VT before, I thought it was raising a perfectly appropriate issue as to whether or not JADE HELM, which is an operation that covers at least seven states (and now seems to have expanded to five or six more) could possibly be the cover for imposing martial law under the pretext of conducting operations in urban settings, which are meant to train personnel “for foreign operations”, where nothing about this has struck me as right from the beginning. As a consequence, I was glad to see he had published about it: But I could hardly believe the response from Gordon and Jim. Not only did they “tag team” Robert and imply that he had been played for a sap but asserted that, “We have checked our sources who would be in a position to know if something like this were going on, and it categorically is not.” The problem with this approach is that we ordinary readers are not in the position to verify “their sources”. This is a classic appeal to authority, where we are supposed to take their word for it. And while I might be disposed to accept those assurances on routine matters, in this instance, the case of JADE HELM is anything but “routine”.Jim Dean piles onIt further astonished me that Jim Dean would reiterate his and Gordon’s position in both the facebook and ordinary comments sections on O’Dowd’s article, which you can easily confirm for yourself. This left some readers, such as Bonny Amey, at a loss as to exactly what was going on. And, indeed, others expressed concern, even in the ordinary comments section, where O’Dowd (in my view, with complete justification) submitted his resignation as a journalist for VT on facebook, explaining that he did not appreciate being used as a whipping boy for having published “a bogus story”, especially when the facts are still in doubt:So is this “a bogus story”?The fellow who seems to be arranging this op and speaking about it in public is one Tony Mead, where his characterization of “JADE HELM” is reasonably elaborate, involving the use of Army Green Berets, Navy SEALS and representatives of the other branches of the US military, which suggests that those who have asserted that this only involves “the national guard” appear to be wrong. Indeed, if what he is telling us in this video presentation is correct, then the appeal to “the national guard” is a bogus story, which troubles me because I heard it from Gordon Duff. But perhaps he had not looked into the situation deeply enough.Contractor’s story about JADE HELM: click here to view the videoIf Gordon had not looked into the situation “deeply enough”, however, then it makes no sense for him to have attacked Robert’s article and assailed him as a dupe who was pushing “a bogus story”. I was troubled enough by all of this that I brought together a group of four guests, including Terri from Nebraska (who had sent me many links), Robert O’Dowd himself (as the one who had raised this issue on VT), Preston James (whom I regard as one of the most astute intellects I have ever known), and last but not least (as a late arrival), Dennis Cimino (with whom I have co-authored multiple articles here) to try to sort all this out:“The Real Deal” (Ep #44): What’s going on with JADE HELM?While I think we made progress in sorting this out, none of our considerations supported the idea that this was “a bogus story” and that no one should be concerned. It came as news to me when my producer, Chance, observed that a parallel operation is taking place in Canada under the name of “Maple Resolve”, which includes closing some 133 Target Stores, not merely for the two months the operation is officially supposed to run but for nine months at the cost of some 17,000 jobs, where their former employees are even being encouraged to find other lines of work. In my opinion, this alters the equation and leaves no doubt:133 Target Stores close in Canada: click here to view the videoWhat conclusion should we draw?Several features of “the big picture” strike me as enormously important. Walmart and Target are stores with mass appeal for the middle and lower class of both Canadian and American society. That some 15 Walmarts should be taken over in the United States alone and now another 133 Targets in Canada is alarming! There is nothing “bogus” about this story. And other sources, such as David Hodges’ “Common Sense Show” have made equally telling observations about the redistribution of resources for a purported “training op” when it entails the dismissal of 17,000 employees, who no doubt are being left in desperate straits:So what conclusions do I draw from my investigations to this date? Gordon Duff and Jim Dean were wrong to censor Robert O’Dowd, whose article was entirely appropriate for a journal devoted to “clandestine activities”. JADE HELM is not a “training op” but something far more serious. When you calculate the profits per store to Walmart and to Target, they are taking an enormous hit, which can only be for some transcendent purpose that override “the conduct of business as usual”. (We are talking about billions of dollars in lost profits, not to mention the loss of highly qualified, experienced personnel to stock products, to resupply those facilities and to process check outs and deliveries.) As an investigative journalist for Veterans Today, I am committed to doing my best to expose the truth, even when it conflicts with the views of Gordon Duff and Jim Dean, who are at liberty to deal with me as severely as they dealt with Robert O’Dowd. I am committed to serve my nation and its best interests, which I do, come what may.Share this on del.icio.usDigg this!Stumble upon something good?

What is being perpetrated on the American people is virtually a complete dissembling of everything they supposedly hold dear and will only lead to their ultimate destruction. A nationwide massacre of their infrastructure, personal rights and protection, and even livelihoods and food security is not only at stake, but now in progress.Here are the key points about JADE HELM:1. Jade Helm is a military exercise endorsed by the American government and perpetrated on its own people in complete violation of not just the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 but is a total affront on every civil liberty the US Constitution and Bill of Rights is supposed to espouse and maintain.2. Occupying sovereign territory with a nation’s own armies indicates the very people for which a government was established to help provide for and protect are their declared enemy.3. The fabricated external threat of terrorism has been deftly translated into meaning that anyone challenging the status quo, be it political, economic or psycho-spiritual, is the enemy. Not external enemies but domestic, as has always been the case, but openly declared since the first so-called Patriot Act. Dissent has become illegal and they’ve virtually declared any thinking American an enemy of the State with a litany of laws, rules and regulations at their disposal while mechanisms set in place long ago to protect personal rights have been eviscerated.4. The very massive size of this operation and the vast amounts of military hardware pouring into distribution locations around the country indicates this is not just an exercise, but a stealth occupation, at the very least designed to intimidate and acclimatize the American mindset to living in virtual martial law conditions, while they step up their preparations for worse social conditions to come.5. As wars rage on against supposed terrorists abroad, targeting a nation’s own citizens in such draconian measures makes absolutely zero sense, when hardly a non-government induced “terror” incident has transpired. Many more have died from medical and pharmaceutical abuse, police killings and even strikes by lightning, along with a host of other causes. Where’s the big brave justice league on the real problems?6. The inherent doctrines of personal freedom and individual sovereignty are being violated with abject impunity, a repugnant affront on human dignity.7. The question haunts: Who’s even noticing? Besides those that fall for the supposed need for such a massive operation, how many are totally ignorant that it is even happening?The Potential Outcome of this Maneuver?a. Anything could trigger this operation to go “live”, as has happened repeatedly with such staged government sponsored operations.b. One resisting individual, real, or more plausibly planted, could cause a chain reaction of events that would be devastating.c. A typical false flag attack on these infiltrating government deployed forces would easily justify a strong armed response, be the incident a lone personal reaction, staged sniper fire, a planted bomb on a military vehicle, or something or things much worse. Such triggers within a staged drill or exercise have proven to work time and again.d. Problem-reaction-solution. Since they’ve created the problem of imposing military control and its intrusions on personal freedoms, so-called practiced or otherwise, the reaction would no doubt be begged. Once the reaction appears from whatever quarter, real or simply reported to have happened, the justification for full on mobilization against the American people, designed from the outset, goes into play. Confiscation of guns and all potential weapons is clearly on the agenda as they’ve been practicing for years following natural and unnatural disasters. Precious metals, large amounts of cash, and even stockpiled food could easily be on the list as well.ConclusionThis Jade Helm 15 operation is no simple exercise. At the very least it is conditioning Americans for more control, even less personal freedom in the metastasizing surveillance state, and something worse in the near future. The bare fact remains that too many will fall for it and continue to stand back in fear and obedience to false, illegitimately imposed fascist controls backed by brute force.The time is now to withdraw your consent and participation in such fear and obeisance mongering.See what is happening for what it is. And sound the alarm. Our full awareness of the nature of these staged operations and broadcasting it far and wide has pushed them back before, and we can do it again. Let your awareness, indignation and refusal to accept this be known far and wide.And be prepared. They’re up to no good and it’s all completely staged for specific reasons. Don’t give them the response they want.Stay lit with truth.Spread the word, disengage from their systems, and keep your peace.Love, ZenShare this on del.icio.usDigg this!Stumble upon something good?

After he lost his case in City Court on August 16, 2013, he appealed to the Danish High Court.The High Court set a court date of March 12, 2015, for the case to be tried. Last month, Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth informed Harrit’s supporters of the impending appeal and helped raise funds from those supporters to pay his legal expenses.Below, we will describe how Dr. Harrit’s appeal fared.The High Court session had it all — persuasive forensic evidence, courtroom drama, and the strong voice of a reputable scientist who expertly defended the basic laws of physics as well as the evidence of nano-thermite in the WTC dust. Though the verdict will not be known until April 9, it is clear to this observer that Dr. Harrit did an excellent job, not only solidifying his integrity and expertise in the eyes of the public, but also advancing the cause of the 9/11 Truth Movement in the process.Though the High Court case was to convene at 9:30 AM, the court room was already 80% full by 9:00 AM. The 16 seats on the court benches quickly became 20 as people moved closer together. Four more chairs were brought in, but after they, too, were quickly occupied, other would-be onlookers were turned away. By the time the three judges entered the court room, it was filled to capacity.The trial started with Dr. Harrit, who represented himself, asking the court to indulge him as he reviewed the City Court trial and verdict. He also requested the judges’ guidance in case he made any mistakes during the proceedings. In fact, the legal counsel he had received in advance from Danish attorney Mads Krøger Pramming, chairman of the Danish whistleblower organization Veron, made Harrit’s presentation mistake-free. This observer got the impression that, had he not chosen to study and teach chemistry, Dr. Harrit would have made a formidable lawyer.On display was not only the intellect of a professor who inspires students but the prowess of a music and theater performer who impresses audiences — the latter talent developed in Harrit’s after-hours during many of his 70 years. Combining his classroom and stage skills, he proved himself a masterful speaker as he read the “Madness in the Royal Library” article aloud to the judges.In it, Villemoes had written about a 2012 art exhibition at the Royal Library of Denmark that portrayed “The Armenian Genocide.” Calling it “madness” for the library’s director to have allowed the Turkish government to also tell its side of the genocide story, Villemoes went on to cite other examples of “madness”: the beliefs of creationists, Holocaust deniers, and 9/11 skeptics such as Dr. Harrit. Indeed, while Dr. Harrit’s reading was as compelling as listening to a great musician performing, it was his sincerity that caught everyone’s attention.Finally, it was time for Dr. Harrit to present the first piece of new evidence. He projected a video of World Trade Center Building 7’s collapse onto the wall of the High Court. As the video played the 6.5-second collapse of the 600-foot, 47-story building over and over, the professor described what was happening, and in so doing showed himself to be a logical scientist who naturally had questions about a phenomenon that was identical in appearance to a controlled demolition. From the expression on one judge’s face — a look of disbelief that 9/11 skeptics know quite well — it was obvious he had never before seen the video. Whether the other two judges had watched the collapse of WTC 7 before is hard to say; their faces were inscrutable. Making the judges watch WTC 7 fall again and again was what Dr. Harrit later called his biggest achievement of the day.Dr. Harrit also presented various documents he had submitted as attachments to the case, including the Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth petition (currently signed by 2,332 credentialed architects and engineers and 20,100 other supporters), the 2009 nano-thermite report he co-wrote with a team of scientists (“Active Thermitic Material Found In The Dust From The 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe”), the AE911Truth-sponsored polls taken by professional pollsters in the USA and Canada (in both countries, roughly half of those surveyed believed, after being shown the collapse of WTC 7, that it either definitely was or most likely was a controlled demolition).Next, the plaintiff quoted from the 2005 report published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which purportedly explained the collapse of The Twin Towers. He homed in on what he considers to be the most important footnote written since WWII — namely, footnote 13 on page 82.First Dr. Harrit read it to the judges in English:The focus of the investigation was the sequence of events from the instant of aircraft impact to the initiation of collapse for each tower. For brevity in this report, this sequence is referred to as the “probable collapse sequence,” although it does not actually include the structural behavior of the towers after conditions for the collapse initiation were reached and collapse became inevitable.Then he translated it into Danish. He went on to explain that the footnote was a prime example of “academic terror” in the NIST report. That is, not even a reader trained in physics and familiar with physics reports would be able to understand what this footnote said when reading it for the first time. The professor’s point was proved when the judge in charge of keeping the court protocols asked Dr. Harrit to translate the last sentence again.Dr. Harrit pointed out that between the lines in this footnote NIST was actually admitting that there is no public theory on how the North Tower and South Tower were destroyed, nor is there an explanation of the collapse sequence, as the report stops at the moment the towers were about to go down. Upon hearing this explanation, the accused Søren Villemoes raised his eyebrows in seeming surprise and leaned back in his chair.The day of 9/11 Truth evidence schooling for Villemoes and the judges had hardly begun. The plaintiff proceeded with the next bit of evidence: A screenshot from a Facebook update Villemoes had written the day after the City Court trial in 2013 showed him admitting that he had not been fair to Dr. Harrit.After Dr. Harrit had presented his case to the High Court, it was time for the four witnesses to take the stand, one by one.A young lawyer representing Villemoes (substituting for lawyer Søren Juul, who had handled the case in City Court) rose from his chair and started speaking. Acting nervous and seeming unprepared, he started asking Niels Harrit questions in a barely audible voice. He tried to make a case to the court that Dr. Harrit was saying the United States itself was behind the 9/11 attacks. To that charge, Harrit replied that he was a natural scientist and that he has conducted science-based presentations on the collapse of WTC 7 more than 230 times without ever pointing fingers at any suspects. “I believe in the rule of law,” Dr. Harrit said, “and there has never been any a legal investigation of 9/11 in court, making it impossible for a person like me, who believes in the law, to name anyone who should have committed the crime.”Villemoes then took the stand. Harrit first asked the journalist about the 2013 Facebook comment he had made about not having treated the chemist with fairness. Villemoes answered that he had felt pity on Dr. Harrit after the City Court case. Next, Harrit brought up a statement Villemoes had made in City Court, in which he claimed to have seen Harrit’s lecture about WTC 7 but couldn’t remember where he had seen it. Villemoes answered that he now recalled the lecture had been on the Danish island of Bornholm. Harrit pointed out that he had given that lecture in June 2013, just two months before the City Court date. He remarked how odd it was that Villamoes couldn’t remember (in City Court) where he had seen it two months earlier but could now remember it (in High Court) one and a half years later. “For how long did you watch my lecture?” Dr. Harrit then asked. Villemoes replied that he had seen only five minutes of the 2½-hour long lecture — an answer that revealed his factual basis for criticizing Dr. Harrit to be exceedingly weak.In City Court, Villemoes had claimed that the WTC dust in the nano-thermite report could have been unauthentic. That charge gave Dr. Harrit a reason to submit the WTC dust as evidence to the High Court. In so doing, Dr. Harrit verified the authenticity of his dust samples by pointing to two photographs on page 24 in the nano-thermite report, which showed the same kind of iron microspheres found in the dust by RJ Lee Group in 2003 and by the US Geological Survey in 2005. He then held before Villemoes a plastic bag with his own sample of WTC dust, dragging a strong magnet along the side of the plastic, trying to make a little rim of black particles gather near the edges of the magnet. On the first attempt, Villemoes failed to see the black rim. But on the second try, he said he could see it, and Dr. Harrit told him that, since we all know that magnets attract iron, this was the iron microspheres being separated from the dust particles not containing iron. This was proof that a thermitic reaction had taken place on 9/11, Dr. Harrit told Villemoes.After a short break, the court reassembled to carry on with the two last witnesses. One witness was architect Jan Utzon, who had worked on recent projects for the Sydney Opera House in Australia, which his father Jørn had designed nearly 50 years earlier. The other witness was a former colleague of Dr. Harrit, Per Hedegaard, who taught physics at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen. Utzon had already taken the stand as a witness in City Court, where he represented AE911Truth and its signatories. Dr. Hedegaard was a new witness who purportedly had changed his position from being against the theories presented by Dr. Harrit to admitting that the official explanation of what happened to WTC 7 was in violation of Newton’s laws of physics.Jan Utzon reiterated the testimony he had already given at City Court, telling the judges that no steel-framed high-rise has ever collapsed due to fire and that he had no doubts about the collapse of WTC 7 being a controlled demolition.When Per Hedegaard finally entered the court room, he looked nervous and confused. Asked specific questions by Dr. Harrit, he was unable to give direct answers. For example, even though the looping video of the collapse of WTC 7 was shown a second time during the testimony of Utzon and a third time when he took the stand, Dr. Hedegaard said he could not see any violation of physical laws. While agreeing that the collapse of WTC 7 looked close to free-fall acceleration, he noted that it was too complicated for him to say for sure.“But what does it mean when a building is falling 9.8 metres per second squared, Per?” Harrit asked. The professor of physics said he did not know. “This means the building is in free fall, Per,” Harrit elaborated. “And when a building is in free fall, is there then energy left to destroy the supporting structure?” Hedegaard’s answer was confusing. He talked about how energy moved faster than free-fall and suggested that WTC 7 could have fallen even faster than free-fall.“But Per, you told me you had looked at the data, and that you supported it,” Harrit responded. Again, Hedegaard gave a confusing answer. The judge in charge of court protocols asked the witness what data it was that he actually supported. “Only the report,” he replied, referring to the nano-thermite report. “I read some of it, and it looked good.”Hedegaard had earlier calculated, on his own, that at least 60 tons of thermite would have been needed to take down the Twin Towers, and on that basis he found it difficult to believe that controlled demolition had been used to level those two buildings.Though Hedegaard did say he found the nano-thermite report “good,” his other answers were clearly not what Harrit had been expecting. An obviously disappointed Harrit told the judges he had no more questions for the witness.Villemoes’ lawyer asked Hedegaard if he could support statements he had made about Harrit quoted in an article used in City Court — statements substantiating that Dr. Harrit was a “crackpot”. Hedegaard replied that he still agreed with his statements in the article, in which he had called Harrit’s theories “nuts.” That became the final answer from the last witness of the day.After a lunch break, the High Court reconvened and gave both Niels Harrit and the lawyer for the accused Villemoes each 30 minutes to give their final statement, called a procedure.Those who had seen the outstanding procedure Harrit gave in City Court 1 ½ years earlier now witnessed a procedure that was even more brilliant, displaying the skills of a top-drawer attorney. He named paragraph 267 of the Danish Criminal Code and Article 10, Sections 1 and 2, of the European Human Rights Convention, pointing out that should Villemoes be found not guilty, then the Danish criminal code is obsolete. All other libel cases tried in Danish courts, he said, have been decided based upon the occurrence of a factual basis for the utterance. Yet in this case, Harrit declared, “We have seen no facts from Villemoes showing any kind of factual basis for his claims. And this is why the court must find him guilty in libel, according to the law.”Harrit referred to the historical court case against Galileo Galilei in 1633, where the accused was brought in front of the inquisition of the Roman Catholic Church and tortured until he renounced his belief that the earth rotated around the sun and acknowledged that the earth was the center of the universe.When he concluded his procedure, there was no doubt that Dr. Harrit had made an impact upon the High Court. The three judges looked as if they approved the legal points he made, and both Villemoes and his lawyer appeared a bit shaken.Villemoes’ lawyer, in his procedure, said there was no reason to put forward a factual basis for the statements his client made in the article, as it could be read in all the official 9/11 reports. His statement seemed weak compared to all the evidence brought forward during the day — evidence showing that it is more than reasonable to question the official 9/11 story about Osama bin Laden and the 19 alleged hijackers who, armed with box cutters, managed to carry out a highly coordinated attack on the world’s most advanced military power.The judgment from the three High Court judges runs for four weeks from the court date, meaning the verdict will be announced on April 9, 2015, at 10 AM Denmark time. Coincidentally, this date is precisely 75 years after the 1940 German occupation of Denmark during WWII. On April 9, 2015, we will see whether the system of justice in Denmark protects the free speech of the common man or continues the deception that has plunged the world into an endless “War on Terror.” Hopefully, we will one day look back on this date as the occasion when the Danish High Court acknowledged that skepticism about the official story of 9/11 is a legitimate way of thinking and ordered that it be protected within the Danish laws of free speech.Less than an hour after the trial ended, Dr. Harrit did this interview with www.911truth.dk, in which he gives his view of the High Court meeting.Besides listening to that interview, you can visit Niels Harrit’s Facebook page, which details his contributions to the 9/11 Truth Movement.Support from all over the world for this High Court case has been overwhelming to both Dr. Harrit and the 9/11 activists who helped raise awareness for this historical event. Thank you to all who have followed and supported his case.

While Stan was walking on the Mall, he met people from DC911Truth, signed their petition, and proudly held up one of their placards. Shortly thereafter, he watched AE911Truth’s two-hour Blueprint for Truth. Since then, he has become both an active member of AE’s Presenter Team and a financial contributor.Stan also supports Firefighters for 9/11 Truth. In fact, he has visited fire stations in Farmington Hills, near Detroit, and in Brooklyn, New York, and talked with the firefighters about 9/11. One of the people who came up to thank him after his presentation in Brighton, Michigan, said that his son had been to a firefighters’ gathering, where the general feeling was that “controlled demolitions brought the buildings down.”WTC Building #7, a 47-story high-rise not hit by an airplane, exhibited all the characteristics of classic controlled demolition with explosives:Rapid onset of collapseSounds of explosionsSymmetrical structural failureFree-fall acceleration through the path of what was greatest resistanceImploded, collapsing completely, landing almost in its own footprintMassive volume of expanding pyroclastic-like cloudsExpert corroboration from the top European controlled demolition professionalForeknowledge of “collapse” by media, NYPD, FDNYIn the aftermath of WTC7’s destruction, strong evidence of demolition using incendiary devices was discovered:FEMA finds rapid oxidation and intergranular melting on structural steel samplesSeveral tons of molten metal reported by numerous highly qualified witnessesChemical signature of the incendiary thermite found in solidified molten metal, and dust samplesWTC7 exhibited none of the characteristics of destruction by fire:Slow onset with large visible deformationsAsymmetrical collapse which follows the path of least resistance (laws of conservation of momentum would cause a falling, to the side most damaged by the fires)Evidence of fire temperatures capable of softening steelHigh-rise buildings with much larger, hotter, and longer lasting fires have never collapsedAs seen in this revealing photo, the Twin Towers’ destruction exhibited all of the characteristics of destruction by explosives:Destruction proceeds through the path of greatest resistance at nearly free-fall accelerationImprobable symmetry of debris distributionExtremely rapid onset of destructionOver 100 first responders reported explosions and flashesMulti-ton steel sections ejected laterallyMid-air pulverization of 90,000 tons of concrete & metal deckingMassive volume of expanding pyroclastic-like clouds1200-foot-diameter debris field: no “pancaked” floors foundIsolated explosive ejections 20–40 stories below demolition frontTotal building destruction: dismemberment of steel frameSeveral tons of molten metal found under all 3 high-risesEvidence of thermite incendiaries found by FEMA in steel samplesEvidence of explosives found in dust samplesThe three high-rises exhibited none of the characteristics of destruction by fire:Slow onset with large visible deformationsAsymmetrical collapse which follows the path of least resistance (laws of conservation of momentum would cause a falling, intact, from the point of plane impact, to the side most damaged by the fires)Evidence of fire temperatures capable of softening steelHigh-rise buildings with much larger, hotter, and longer-lasting fires have never collapsedWhoWhatWhy.com informs readers of NYC ballot initiativeEditor’s Note: Investigative reporter Russ Baker launched the online publication WhoWhatWhy.com five years ago to do what he calls “forensic journalism”—that is, reporting that is “rigorous, relentless, and scientific.” Sounds like a description of AE911Truth’s research, doesn’t it? In mid-August, Baker wrote an article about the NYC Coalition for Accountability NOW (NYC CAN), and interviewed its founder, Ted Walter. You can read the piece here:Putting a 9/11 Mystery on the BallotI was standing blocks from Building 7 of the World Trade Center complex and staring directly at it when it collapsed.Working for the Los Angeles Times, I had arrived at the World Trade Center as the South and North Tower were making their rapid and deadly descents in the morning. That afternoon, I called in a series of reports to a staffer in the New York bureau.I was literally on the phone with the office at 5:21 p.m., describing the fires burning in the structure as the building began—and completed—its remarkably fast, smooth descent to the ground. I described the building neatly pancaking, and the Pulitzer Prize winner on the other end taking my dictation declared: “That sounds like a controlled demolition.”It’s likely that no one has given more presentations on this subject than Stan other than AE911Truth founder Richard Gage, AIA, according to Daniel Noel, AE911Truth’s Presenter Team leader. Noel is especially impressed with how many ways Stan finds to get the word out both in his own community (where he calls upon his broad range of contacts in the non-profit world, leaflets in various neighborhoods, and reaches out to people he doesn’t know) and beyond his community. “Stan travels far away from home just to present AE911Truth to the public, and he systematically looks for presentation opportunities wherever he goes,” recounts Noel.Between when he joined the Presenter Team in 2010 and the end of 2012, Stan gave 12 presentations about 9/11 Truth. In the 18 months since then, he’s made another 15 presentations in Michigan, Florida, and Washington, D.C. The wide variety of groups he has spoken to include Rotary Clubs, the Destroyer Escort Sailors Association, Mid-Michigan Atheists and Humanists, the Southeast Michigan Mensa organization, Grey Panthers, and Ann Arbor Science and Skeptics. Most recently, he was invited to give a presentation on July 25 at the Veterans for Peace Convention, which was held at the University of North Carolina in Asheville.One time Stan presented the evidence to a group of 16 at a friend’s home. Later his friend called and told him that several people who attended the gathering said they’d had trouble sleeping that night and wished there had been a follow-up meeting to discuss the 9/11 events.Sometimes Stan isn’t the presenter but organizes presentations for others. For example, in 2011 he secured a venue for Richard Gage to speak at Lawrence Technological University in Detroit. At the event was a Fox News reporter, who invited Richard to the studio to be interviewed on that night’s 10 PM local news broadcast.Stan’s reward for all this volunteer work is simply the “satisfaction I get from fulfilling a mission,” as he puts it. “I’m motivated by a quest for justice.”If you would like to help introduce the truth of 9/11 to fellow Americans — or citizens of any country — consider joining the AE911Truth Presenter Team. Simply fill out a volunteer form. Just think: You will have the opportunity of showing the evidence to people who have never been exposed to it before. This could well advance the cause of securing a real investigation. Stan Beattie, for one, is sure you won’t have any regrets.Anatomy of a Great Deception || Times Square Digital Billboard || Actions in New York CityUpdated Details & Lineup here.Streaming video from AE911Truth eventsMany of our New York City Events will be carried live by Jeff Durkin of WeAreChange Connecticut!
