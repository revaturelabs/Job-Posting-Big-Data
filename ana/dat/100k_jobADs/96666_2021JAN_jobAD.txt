But before we do, there are few things we must consider:Are we ready to give up our weekends?Is working late hours something we are comfortable with?Are we what we call a “people person”?Can we take orders and remain calm under pressure?Do we deal with patrons that could become rude and rowdy?Bartending can be a very lucrative and reward career. For others, it can be a simple sideline job while in school. Whatever it may be, bartending does require certain skills that can be taught in bartending schools and experienced in the line of fire.A professional bartender understands both the needs of the clients and what is required to become effective during service. A bartender’s quick check list:Is my liquor inventory up to par?Is my beer inventory properly stocked?Are my fruits and condiments prepared?Do I have enough ice?Does my till have enough change?A bartender knows what can be called the “golden hours” at which point all they do is take orders and serve drinks. To maximize the full potential, preparation is key.Topics: Bar inventory, Bar staff, bartending schools, Bar Management, Liquor cost, hospitality jobs, ControlBenifits of Bartending SchoolsPosted by Rob Scanga on Tue, Aug, 24, 2010 @ 14:08 PMTweetBartending SchoolAn important part of any hospitality environment is the personnel they hire.

If you are considering a bar consultant for your business, it is a good idea to understand what they can bring to your company in terms of information.A bar consultant normally has a background in the nightclub, restaurant and hotel industry. They understand the various facets of the business from the sales, controls, marketing and human resource sides of the business. Before hiring a bar consultant, it is always a good idea to ask them where their strengths lie and of course who they have consulted for.If you are a large nightclub with multiple pouring stations, a consultant from the hotel or restaurant field might not be suited for the job. Bar consulting must help you take decisions that will have a positive impact on your operations. There are some bar consultants that focus on controls and how to implement liquor, beer and wine inventory procedures. Others are more front of the house bar consultants and focus on service and personnel.There are bar consultants that will help you with the image of your bar and give you marketing ideas and promotions to help increases sales. When you are in the process of hiring a bar consult, it is maybe a good idea to ask if they work alone or have a team that can cover specific or maybe all areas of the operation that need attention. In the end, proper bar consulting can bring you the added knowledge you may need to improve the overall performance and profitability of your bar.Topics: inventory managers, Bar staff, alcohol cost, hospitality jobsAlcohol inventory systems: Are they right for your business?Posted by Nick Kaoukis on Thu, May, 27, 2010 @ 14:05 PMTweetAn alcohol inventory system can cover many facets of your business and secure the profitability of each. Are you a high volume liquor bar?Than your liquor inventory should be a priority and your focus should be on accuracy, speed and strong data that will create accountability. Maybe you sell more beer, both bottled and draft. If so, there are alcohol inventory systems that not only make counting bottled beer simple, but also help you track draft beer consumption.If you can start counting how much draft beer is lost to spillage, foaming, waste...you will be in a better position to take the corrective actions needed to raise the profit margin bars. Wine is another component your alcohol inventory system must be able to manage. In today's hospitality industry, wine can be served by the bottle, but also by the glass and in certain concepts, wine tasting are offered as a means to increase interest and sales.The system you choose to implement must be able to give you the information you need to take decision that have an effect on purchasing, human resources and ultimately sales. A good alcohol inventory system puts everything into perspective and gives you the tools to better manage your business today but also long into the future.Topics: inventory, liquor inventory, inventory managers, hospitality jobsHospitality JobsPosted by Nick Kaoukis on Wed, May, 19, 2010 @ 09:05 AMTweetProfile of the week: The Beverage Director/Beverage ManagerDoes your hotel, high volume restaurant, nightclub or country club have a beverage director or beverage manager? If the answer is yes, do they know what their job description is?The beverage director/manager is put in place to oversee the entire beverage operation. As a member of the management team, they are in charge of hiring all beverage related personnel, negotiating and purchasing all of the beverages and beverage equipment needed by the business, creating and maintaining the standards in regards to the beverage operation.Another key area is establishing proper inventory levels and the controls required to keep the company's profit objectives in line. In most cases, the modern beverage director/manager will work with the technology the industry has now come to embrace. Liquor, beer and wine inventory software programs help the collection and analysis of information to make the sound decisions the company needs to stay in line with their profit goals.A beverage director will normally report to the director of operations or chief financial officer of the establishment. The prior experience a beverage manager has is typically experience in the industry. At some point in their careers, they have worked as bartenders, servers or even been responsible for the actual inventory taking of a hospitality establishment. A management background or experience is a great asset as they will have to position themselves between the beverage staff (waitresses, liquor runners' bartenders...) and upper management. They must be able to take or report certain delicate situations which may arise with the beverage personnel with the ultimate goal of keeping the liquor, beer and wine pour cost percentages in line with the budgets created by the management team.Topics: inventory managers, Bar staff, hospitality jobsAll postsSubscribe by Email and Receive Valuable InformationFollow MePromotionsMost Popular PostsPosts by MonthFebruary 2011 (4)October 2010 (1)September 2010 (5)August 2010 (6)July 2010 (3)June 2010 (7)May 2010 (7)Browse by Tagalcohol (1)alcohol cost (3)banquet events (1)bar (3)bar control (2)Bar inventory (7)bar inventory levels (3)Bar Management (5)Bar products (1)Bar staff (5)Bar trends (1)bartending schools (3)beer (2)beer inventory (4)beer system (1)blends (1)bourbon (2)Control (2)controling costs (1)corperate events (1)drink recipe (1)facebook (1)free pour (4)Hospitality (2)hospitality industry show (2)hospitality jobs (6)Hospitality show (2)Hotel Inventory (2)hotel parties (1)inventory (2)inventory counting (2)inventory managers (4)inventory schedule (1)Latin America (1)Lineup control (1)liquor (5)Liquor cost (3)liquor inventory (6)Liquor Inventory savings (4)liquor inventory timing (1)liquor purchasing (1)managing liquor inventory cost (2)Maslow's Hierrarchy (1)NightClub Management (1)Nightclub trends (1)nightclubs (1)pricing drinks (1)profit (4)Referal program (1)restaurant trends (1)Scannabar Inventory system (1)scotch (2)single malt (1)Single malt whisky (1)social media (1)Software (1)South America (1)spirits (1)tell a friend (1)trade show (2)Tradeshow (1)twitter (1)weddings (1)whiskey (1)wine (3)Wine Celler (1)Wine Control (2)wine inventory (5)About UsOverviewProductsSupportKnowledge BaseSite Map© 2018 SCANNABAR INC.
