An IP address is typically written in decimal digits, formatted as four 8-bit fields separated by periods. Each 8-bit field represents a byte of the IP address.Every time you’re online, your IP address lets web servers know where to reach you. It’s how you can visit websites, for example.However, your IP address includes a lot of details, like:Your countryYour regionYour cityYour ZIP codeYour longitudeYour latitudeYou probably wouldn’t share such info with strangers, yet you’re doing it online all the time.One of the biggest trackers of your digital life is your Internet Service Provider, ISP for short. Since your IP address is uniquely assigned to you, they can easily keep tabs on everything you do.In most countries, ISPs are legally required to store logs on your digital activity and browsing history. They can even be forced to monitor traffic and throttle speeds when you’re on file-sharing or streaming platforms.When dealing with ISPs, authorities and law enforcement agencies can generally access everything without a hitch, and your consent as a user is not needed. And because of how browsing databases work, the information is often handed over in bulk.This way, even if you’re not under investigation, your data can still get to the authorities if another ISP client does something shady.And if you’re not already worried about your privacy, let me add one more thing: many ISPs dabble in selling your data to advertisers.Switch to CyberGhost VPNA VPN is a secure way of accessing the internet and keeping your connection private.
