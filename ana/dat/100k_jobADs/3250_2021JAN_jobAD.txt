Active Life Member Thomas L. Graves, “Tommy,” was taken from us on Box 18-2, at 9923 Good Luck Road. Tommy was working at Glendale Station 18 as the Tower Driver when he responded on the call. While battling the fire at the garden apartment, an explosion occurred causing part of the building to collapse burying Tommy under the front brick wall. Thomas Graves paid the ultimate sacrifice by giving his life in service to his fellow man. He was the first career Firefighter of Prince George’s County Fire Department to be killed in the line of duty. Tommy laid in state at Station 28 before being laid to rest. God Bless Tommy and his family. ...
