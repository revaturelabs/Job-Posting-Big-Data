The technology company offers inbound-patient management software for PT practices and publishes a blog covering industry issues.The aging American population, our sedentary lifestyles, population growth and early specialization in youth sports all have contributed to an annual growth rate of 6.2% for the PT industry since 2007, according to BetterPT. But new innovations and technology have the potential to change the industry in meaningful ways in both the short and long term.Here are six trends to look out for in the PT industry in 2020, according to BetterPT.1) Merit-based incentive payment systems (MIPS) for PT billing – Physical therapists became eligible to enroll in MIPS last year, and they figure to see increased usage this year with clinics also eligible, according to BetterPT. MIPS are among the new innovations in PT that will replace PQRS data reporting, with the goal of lowering the cost of care while improving the quality.The MIPS payment adjustment score for PT may be different for each provider because it is based on the following four metrics: quality (replacing PQRS), improvement activities, advancing care information and cost. A PT’s score according to the MIPS determines the payment adjustment applied to that PT’s Medicare B payments two years later, according to BetterPT.2) More mergers and acquisitions in health care – Back in 2017, the 50 largest health-care companies represented only 25% of the total market, illustrating the highly fragmented nature of the industry. But mergers-and-acquisitions activity was especially strong in health care over the past two years, and 2020 likely will continue that trend, BetterPT reported.Large corporations will continue to purchase smaller hospital systems to enlarge their established networks and gain market share, BetterPT said.3) Using technology to boost referrals – Independent PT practices likely won’t be able to rely on physicians as their primary sources of referrals because hospitals and doctors are trying to keep patients within their network and are less willing to refer them out. That will lead privately owned PT practices to rely on tech advancements to help them maintain or increase their patient caseload, BetterPT said. Those advancements include direct access, social-media marketing and digital patient engagement tools.4) Having more out-of-network providers impacts PT reimbursement – Lower reimbursement rates and stricter Medicare guidelines for PT billing will cause private practices to shift toward being considered out-of-network providers, according to BetterPT. As more patients seek out other options for care, that could result in Medicare changes for PT, the website said.Clinics will have to maintain strong relationships with their patients, instead of with insurance carriers, since patients will be paying more for PT. Many patients will have to pay PT clinics out of pocket and await partial reimbursement from their insurance providers, or rely on their health-care flexible-spending accounts to pay for PT.By leveraging their patient volume and clinics, corporately run PT practices will be able to retain in-network benefits with their PT billing. But smaller practices won’t thrive with this model for PT insurance reimbursement and will aim to become part of a PT network such as PTPN, according to BetterPT.5) Advanced APMs expand upon Medicare guidelines for PT billing – Like MIMS, advanced alternative payment models (APMs) were established as quality payment program options for PT under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act. Both options involve PTs earning a score based on their job performance to determine Medicare guidelines for PT billing, according to BetterPT.With advanced APMs, however, PTs take on additional risks in an effort to collect higher incentive payments based on patient outcomes. Advanced APMs will be a major part of a broader transformation of PT billing, BetterPT reported. With their emphasis on providing affordable, effective care, advanced APMs and MIPS are likely to help shape PT Medicare guidelines for many years to come, providing additional benefits and changes for all industry stakeholders, the website said.6) Telehealth services will see increased use for initial evaluations and overall PT plans – PT practices seek to build meaningful relationships with patients to keep them connected to the clinic and encourage them to show up for their next visit, and technology will play an increased role in this effort, according to BetterPT. The expanded use of telehealth services can make PT practices more efficient and improve the patient experience.<< Back to career adviceSearch JobsZip CodewithinRadius Distance 20 miles 50 miles 100 miles 200 milesORCityState All States/Provinces Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District Of Columbia Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming Puerto Rico U.S. Virgin IslandsJob Type All Types Full-time Part-time PRN Temporary TravelingDesired Setting All Settings Academic-Education Acute Care Hospital Health & Wellness Facility Home Health Hospital-Outpatient Clinic Independent Contractor Long Term Care/Skilled Nursing Facility Private Practice-Clinic Private Practice-Pediatrics Research School System-Pediatrics Sub Acute/Rehab Hospital Traveling PT OtherJob Source: Any Direct Employer Recruiting/Staffing FirmSearch JobsLatest Career Advice​Simple Tips for Acing Your Virtual Job InterviewFemale runners get more stress fractures than men, and new research points to risk factorsInsurers Will Have a Big Say in the Future of Telehealth ServicesEmailSubscribe to PTCareerClinic to stay up to date on job search trends and PT news!Email addressHPSubmitJob SeekersSearch JobsPost a ResumeResourcesSite MapEmployersRates & ServicesPost JobsResourcesAbout UsContact Us2620 SE Maricamp RDOcala, FL 344711-866-785-6271Info@PTJobs.comCopyright ©2021 PTJobs.com - Terms Of Use"
