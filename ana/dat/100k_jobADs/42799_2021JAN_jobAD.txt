It’s the perfect all-rounder, particularly loved by families, honeymooners and groups. There’s also accommodation to suit every budget and type of traveller. Mauritius may be a ‘fly-and-flop’ holiday favourite, but don’t think that’s all there is to it. Check out the many unique and natural attractions across the island, sample local Creole cuisine, swim, paddle or SUP in the warm turquoise water or check into any spa to recharge.Experience ZanzibarHop on a plane to sultry Zanzibar for an unforgettable honeymoon or romantic getaway.
