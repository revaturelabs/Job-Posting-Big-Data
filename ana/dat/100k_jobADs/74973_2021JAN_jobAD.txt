After my second co-op with them, they offered me a permanent position starting February 2020,” said Buchele, who accepted the position. “I would never have received a job offer from Marathon at another university.”ConnectEd IssuesVol. 1, No. 1ConnectED | Summer 2013Vol. 1, No. 2ConnectED | Fall 2013Vol. 2, No. 1ConnectED | Winter 2014Vol. 2, No. 2ConnectED | Spring 2014Vol. 2, No. 3ConnectED | Summer 2014Vol. 2, No. 4ConnectED | Fall 2014Vol. 3, No. 1ConnectED | Winter 2015Vol. 3, No. 2ConnectED | Spring 2015Vol. 3, No. 3ConnectED | Summer 2015Vol. 3, No. 4ConnectED | Fall 2015Vol. 4, No. 1ConnectED | Winter 2016Vol. 4, No. 2ConnectED | Spring 2016Vol. 4, No. 3ConnectED | Summer 2016Vol. 4, No. 4ConnectED | Fall 2016Vol. 5, No. 1ConnectED | Winter 2017Vol. 5, No. 2ConnectED | Spring 2017Vol. 5, No. 3ConnectED | Summer 2017Vol. 5, No. 4ConnectED | Fall 2017Vol. 6, No. 1ConnectED | Winter 2018Vol. 6, No. 2ConnectED | Spring 2018Vol. 6, No. 3ConnectED | Summer 2018Vol. 6, No. 4ConnectED | Fall 2018Vol. 7, No. 1ConnectED | Winter 2019Vol. 7, No. 2ConnectED | Spring 2019Vol. 7, No. 3ConnectED | Summer 2019Vol. 7, No. 4ConnectED | Fall 2019Vol. 8, No. 1ConnectED | Winter 2020Vol. 8, No. 2ConnectED | Spring 2020Vol. 8, No. 3ConnectED | Summer 2020Vol. 8, No. 4ConnectED | Fall 2020ConnectED | Fall 2019Northeast Ohio business community supports student developmentTweets by OhioHigherEdOhio Department of Higher Education25 South Front Street, Columbus, OH, 43215, US · (614) 466-6000 · fax: (614) 466-5866 · hotline@highered.ohio.govCopyright © 2021 by the Ohio Department of Higher Education.
