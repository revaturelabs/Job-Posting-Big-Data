Inspired by Suiseki - also called Scholar's Rocks or Viewing Stones. They are interesting rocks that I could look at for hours and hours and find inspiration and beauty. I will be making prints available shortly of my favorites. If you see something you like, let me know.A Boss!1/17/20210 CommentsToday was a really great art day and unexpected too. I just decided I was going to see what happens again and pulled out a really old canvas I had gessoed over ages ago. This whole piece is a conservators nightmare as I gessoed over an old oil piece, that I think also had some collage and I have no idea how many years the acrylic over top will stay on for but hey, I am not the only artist whose work turned became ephemera over time because they didn't have the money to buy new canvases. SPEAKING OF!!! you can really help support me over on Patreon.com/JoBlakely or at ko-fi.com/joblakely and I will be buying canvases and brushes and some proper photography to make prints too.So here's the latest piece and I think I am going to do a few more, maybe many more, fashion inspired pieces since I love drawing patterns, fabrics - this sort of thing is my thing. Or one of them! I have lots of 'things' that aren't actually things. lol.The name of the piece that kept coming to mind was Paid The Cost To Be The Boss which is the title of an old B.B, King tune and I am a massive B.B. King fan too.It's Acrylic on 8 x 16 cradled canvas0 CommentsBack to traditional media...1/9/20210 CommentsGetting back to working in traditional materials and chose acrylics because they are non-toxic and fast drying and I like to work fast. I also knew they'd be a challenge to make work as they are very unforgiving and it will really force me to get better at color mixing, form, & tones to help make the piece work without blending much. I hope to simplify the forms more and more as I improve. Doing studies in acrylic on A5 natural 210gsm paper right now.
