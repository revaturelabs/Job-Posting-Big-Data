She also voted for a budget that includes an $8 million deficit; “balancing” the deficit by drawing down reserves; and increasing the city’s $1.2 billion debt.“Council election” is NOT about “business growth and job creation.” It is about representing the residents first and foremost. It’s about stewardship of taxpayer money and resources. It’s about efficiently providing public services.Business growth and job creation (to the extent that any city council member has EVER “created” even one job) are important considerations, but not the primary consideration. Council election is NOT about enriching your political allies and campaign contributors at the expense of taxpayers.As Henry Ford said,It is not the employer who pays wages — he only handles the money. It is the product who pays the wages.In Scottsdale the product is hospitality, along with a healthy dose of healthcare services and research. Suzanne Klapp seems to have forgotten that, and her unbridled growth will kill that goose.Previous Post Next PostYou may also likeApril 12, 2013The Gift of GolfNovember 13, 2013Bond Despondent 3January 29, 2014TPC Makeover2 CommentsNorm Seeley Jr. says:	October 12, 2012 at 8:54 AM	Where in Scottsdale can one find “a healthy dose of healthcare services ‘?ReplySteven says:	October 12, 2012 at 10:03 AM	Great piece. Klapp is doing a great job of painting Copper, Guy, and Chris into a corner. Those candidates need to stress, as you point out, they owe their livelihood to businesses in Scottsdale. But they also understand what PUBLIC SERVICE means, and to that end believe they owe the citizens an engaged and thoughtful Council. Engaged and thoughtful are two things that you see very rarely on Tuesdays in the Kiva.ReplyLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
