Which is why, all across the nation, malls are being re-developed, re-purposed, whatever you want to call it, into mixed-use and housing projects. Projects in Phoenix, Cincinnati, and St. Petersburg are all moving forward.

I try to group things to provide context but sometimes there are things from such a wide variety of sources impacting so many segments of our industry I just have to blurt them out. In no particular order…Congrats to anyone who owned stock at the beginning of the week of Ellie Mae. Thoma Bravo, LLC, a private equity investment firm, announced an all-cash purchase transaction of Ellie that values it at an aggregate equity value of approximately $3.7 billion. Thoma Bravo is no stranger to this: MeridianLink, the parent of LendingQB, an LOS, was purchased last year.Recall that in the summer of 2017 Binh Dang, the co-founder and former president of LendingQB sought a court to force MeridianLink, the loan origination system’s parent company, to dissolve. At that point Dang owned 249,999 shares of MeridianLink while QBSolutions Group, which Dang is listed as the president, owned one share. I mention this because, regarding the announced acquisition of Ellie Mae by Thoma Bravo, Tim Nguyen, CEO and Co-Founder of MeridianLink, sent a note out to clients saying, “Firstly, I wanted to say congratulations to the team at Thoma Bravo and the team at Ellie Mae on the transaction… I want to state that we remain 100% committed to growing and investing in our LendingQB product line and (this news) does nothing to change that perspective… We will continue to fiercely compete and acquire market share as we have for the past 10+ years!”Ellie’s fortunes, given its size, rise and fall with the fortunes of the residential lending industry. They also rise and fall with Ellie’s market share, estimated to be roughly 40%. All Ellie Mae shareholders will receive $99.00 in cash per share from the $17 billion fund. Meridian Link has a notable footing in credit union and bank software, and of course a smaller presence in mortgage with LQB. Thoma Bravo also has interests in McAfee, Barracuda, Compuware and other big software companies. Bloomberg reports that, “The deal includes a 35-day ‘go-shop’ period when Ellie Mae can seek other offers. The acquisition is expected to close in the second or third quarter of this year.”To nearly no one’s surprise, ditech, aka Ditech, announced that it has entered into a restructuring support agreement (RSA) through a Chapter 11 reorganization to reduce its corporate gross debt by $800 million and continue to “explore strategic alternatives including a whole company sale, an asset sale, and outsourcing to a subservicer.”Analysts were quick to point out possible ramifications for the servicing biz given its servicing of $187 billion of total UPB (unpaid principal balance), $83 billion related to the NRZ agreement leaving $104 billion that could be sold. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW) has some thoughts pulled directly from the note, which can be viewed in full here: Ditech Files Chapter 11; MSR Sale Could Impact Servicers and Black Knight. Ditech issued an 8-K a couple weeks ago noting NRZ planned to pull subservicing. In that note KBW analysts highlighted that that the NRZ subservicing portfolio is likely to move to Shellpoint, COOP, and potentially others.Who could buy the free $104 billion of ditech servicing? New Res, Two Harbor, Mr. Cooper (ex-Nationstar), or Ocwen jump to mind. KBW points out that Black Knight could suffer a possible setback since some potential MSR acquirers don’t use it. “While most large servicers use Black Knight’s MSP, two notable servicers that do not are Mr. Cooper and Shellpoint. KBW analysts had originally estimated that NRZ pulling its subservicing would amount to servicing revenue headwinds for BKI of less than 1%. However, because the average loan size in that portfolio is below average, KBW analysts would revise that estimate up slightly to about 1.4% (assuming the entire NRZ portfolio leaves MSP which we continue to think is unlikely) … From conversations with NRZ’s management, we would expect NRZ to allocate that UPB among several servicers possibly including Shellpoint and COOP (neither on BKI’s MSP), as well as to some servicers on MSP.”Switching gears to wholesale, brokers learned from United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) that, “Being in business for yourself doesn’t mean you have to go it alone when it comes to health insurance.

Five federal regulatory agencies issued a joint final rule to implement provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 requiring regulated institutions to accept certain private flood insurance policies in addition to National Flood Insurance Program policies. The OCC, NCUA, FDIC, FCA, and the Federal Reserve Board let us know that the rule, which takes effect July 1, 2019, implements the Biggert-Waters Act requirement that regulated lending institutions accept private flood insurance policies that satisfy criteria specified in the Act, allows institutions to rely on an insurer’s written assurances in a private flood insurance policy stating the criteria are met, clarifies that institutions may, under certain conditions, accept private flood insurance policies that do not meet the Biggert-Waters Act criteria, and allows institutions to accept certain flood coverage plans provided by mutual aid societies, subject to agency approval. Regulations implementing the federal flood insurance statutes prohibit regulated lending institutions from making loans secured by improved real property located in special flood hazard areas unless the property has adequate flood insurance coverage.Final RuleYesterday, Optimal Blue launched a compelling new resource for lenders, loan officers, and consumers. Optimal Blue Mortgage Market Indices, or OBMMI, provides unparalleled transparency into mortgage rates by utilizing observed, real-time lock data from approximately 30% of the market. The data is aggregated daily into multiple national mortgage market indices and engaging visualizations for popular conforming, jumbo, and government loan products as well as unique loan scenarios based on standard LTV and FICO ranges. It will be interesting to see how this new national benchmark for mortgage pricing will help to streamline the mortgage shopping process and connect consumers with their lenders more quickly.Legal and regulatory changesAttorney Phil Stein with Bilzin Sumberg Baena Price & Axelrod LLP writes, “Here’s a case development that will likely be of interest to your readers. The case deals with the statute of limitations for many of the lawsuits facing lenders and LOs. The case should send some light on how an “indemnification” claim is in reality indistinguishable from a “breach of contract” claim.The CFPB posted new compliance tool on its website specific to the TRID Rule. Its Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) provides clarification to the following questions:a financial institutions obligation to provide a new three-day waiting period along with a corrected Closing Disclosure (CD) when a term previously disclosed has changed. How creditors may use model forms that do not reflect the CFPB’s 2017 amendments to the Rule. The impact of a recent TILA amendment to the requirement for corrected disclosures.Capital marketsRates are gradually trudging higher, because they’re tired of going down? The U.S. 10-year closed Tuesday yielding 2.68% amid reports that partisan negotiators in Congress have reached an agreement to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year while providing $1.3 billion, well short of the $5.7 billion requested by the White House, for border security. President Trump said later in the day that he was not happy with the deal but conceded that another shutdown is unlikely to take place. Separately, there was continued speculation that the March 1 deadline for increasing the tariff level on $200 billion worth of imports from China to 25% from 10% could be delayed. There is said to be much optimism surrounding the U.S. trade delegation in Beijing this week. Finally, British Prime Minister Theresa May reportedly plans to step down after Brexit and hopes to have a say in naming a successor.We began today with the usual mortgage applications from the MBA for the week ending February 8 (which dropped nearly 4%, purchases down 6%), the January CPI report (unchanged as expected, +.2% ex-food & energy).

Atlanta’s Bostic, Cleveland’s Mester, and Philadelphia’s Harker will all take the stage. We begin today with Agency MBS worse/lower a few ticks and the 10-year at 2.69%.A successful marriage depends on communication & shared chores. A retired capital markets guy sits around the house in Missouri all day so one day his wife says, “John, could you do something useful like vacuum the house once a week?”The guy gives it a moment’s thought and replies, “Sure, why not. Where’s the vacuum?”Half an hour later, John walks into the kitchen to get some coffee.His wife says, “I didn’t hear the vacuum running; I thought you were going to use it.”Exasperated, John counters, “The stupid thing is broken and won’t start. We should buy a new one!”“Really?” she asks. “Show me – it worked fine the last time I used it.”So, he showed her: https://videos.files.wordpress.com/Xblfe4qf/retired-vacum-cleaner_dvd.mp4Visit www.robchrisman.com for more information on our industry partners, access archived commentaries, or to subscribe to the Daily Mortgage News and Commentary.
