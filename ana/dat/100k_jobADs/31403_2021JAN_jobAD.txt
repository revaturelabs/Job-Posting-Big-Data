How about writing a report from home, getting to work early because you don’t have to deal with a morning commute, or even saving money on transport?These are just a few of the benefits of having a fulltime virtual job—in other words, a job that rarely - or never - requires you to go into an office. The latest trend in recruitment, virtual workers are embracing the rise in technology worldwide and committing to a role that allows flexibility, a certain amount of freedom, and the chance to be productive without even leaving bed. Indeed, 86% of workers say that working from home, and alone, allows them to be even more productive than they would be otherwise. But while an increasing number of companies are offering fulltime remote employment, not all virtual jobs are created equal. In order to find remote employment where you’re supported by your employer and can advance your career, we recommend you look for the following four things in a virtual - or remote - job ad:1. Company-provided equipment. In order to work effectively from home, you need high-quality tech which will let you do everything that the role requires from you. It also needs to have robust security software. Doing your virtual job successfully relies on having good equipment that supports the platforms and software your employer uses. At the very minimum, this should include a laptop and smartphone, as well as pre-installed cybersecurity software.2. Technical support. Though you’re working from home, it’s important to know that you have support, should you require it. Even the best equipment can develop issues, and as a virtual worker, you don’t want to be left high and dry if your laptop crashes. Always make sure the company offers dedicated technical support: it’ll save you a headache later on, and give you peace of mind that will let you tackle your job effectively.3. A supportive manager who’s focused on team building. Having a virtual job has the potential to be lonely: some virtual workers can feel isolated because they never interact with coworkers. However, many employers looking to support remote workers will use programmes that allow you to communicate with your team in a virtual space. In addition, your manager should include you in team events, for example by holding weekly face-time meetings, and cultivate a good team spirit and company culture. Pick somewhere that holds regular nights out; apart from getting out of the house, it’s an excellent chance to build relationships with your co-workers that you will find harder to do online.4. Clear career paths. Many remote workers are afraid they’ll miss out on promotions and other opportunities as they don’t have the chance to build face-to-face relationships with their superiors. Fortunately, many employers do provide career paths for virtual workers. If there’s no mention of this in the job advert, ask your recruiter or the employer directly what room there is for progression.Virtual work can be rewarding, and with the right employer, it can offer you a bright future in a world where more than 50% of people want to increase their remote hours. Make sure that you have the tools and support you need to do your job well, and there will be nothing stopping you from being an efficient, productive employee who will be able to advance quickly within the company.Managing Your CareerShare blogContinue reading​How Do You Lead Multigenerational Workforces?Read-more10 ways your PhD helps you to stand out in the jobs marketRead-moreLife after PhD: Where do you go from here?Read-moreView allKelly ServicesConnecting people to jobs in ways that enrich lives.CONTACT​KellyTalk to us about finding a new job:Tel Phone +44 (0) 115 941 0100Email Email info@kellyservices.co.ukTalk to us about finding talent for your team:Tel Phone + 44 (0) 203 040 1902Email Email info@kellyservices.co.ukKelly UK Tax StrategyPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyUK Modern Slavery Transparency Act StatementHuman Trafficking PolicyCorporate Sustainability PolicyCode of ConductPension Plan Statement of Investment PrinciplesCopyright 2019 Kelly Services ©website byVolcanic"
