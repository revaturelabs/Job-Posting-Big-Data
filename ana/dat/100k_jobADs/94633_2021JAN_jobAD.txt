There is a wide range of dishes that nannies can make using ingredients commonly attributed to the fall season, such as apple, cinnamon, pumpkin, and squash.If you are wondering what dish you could serve the children to celebrate autumn, we put together a simple list of food ideas you could try. Some of the items on this list will be familiar while others will be a modern take to a classic dish. Give them a try and see if you and the children can find one that appeals to your taste buds.Sweet:Apple Pecan Cinnamon MuffinsCinnamon rolls are pretty standard during the autumn season, but have you ever tried making them into cupcakes? This approach gives the dish a new appeal by adding a splash of tartness with apples and a whole lot of crunch from pecans. There is no better way to have breakfast in the autumn than to have a bite of a warm cupcake.Peach CobblerApple isn’t the only star of the season. Peach is another fruit that strongly tastes like the fall, especially when it’s combined with other fall flavours like cinnamon and nutmeg.Peach Cobbler is a classic favourite that takes less than ten minutes to throw together. This dish is best enjoyed warm, but you can store leftovers in the fridge for up to five days. You can also put a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream on top for a sweeter flavour.Apple Pie Ice CreamThe good thing about making ice cream is it gives you a big room for combining a wide range of flavours. A scoop of Autumn ice cream is great for days where the temperature’s cooler but hasn’t gone that cold yet.Apple pie ice cream features all the ingredients you’d see in traditional apple pie: brown sugar, cinnamon, tart apples, and crushed oatmeal cookies. Top it off with yummy caramel sauce!Savoury:Butternut Squash SoupThe butternut squash soup is perfect for keeping the children warm as the weather starts to become colder. Soup has always proven to be an excellent comfort food, especially in the autumn. This recipe is incredibly easy to make and packed full of vitamins. Butternut squash also has the right amount of sweet and savoury for that cosy fall vibe.Butternut Squash and Goat Cheese SaladButternut Squash gives salads a wonderful splash of colour and a unique taste. This ingredient stands out very well against the salad greens, while its creaminess works well against the crispy bites of almonds, and the tartness of cranberries. Nannies can also make a home-made honey mustard dressing to give the salad that smokey flavour.Roasted PumpkinPumpkin is one of the key ingredients of the autumn season. Roasted pumpkin is an easy and versatile recipe that could be eaten as a snack of a delicious side dish. Perfectly roasted pumpkins are crispy on the outside and tender in the middle.This dish only needs seven ingredients: pumpkin, olive oil, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, and salt. Smaller pumpkins tend to come out better than other varieties, but you can also use Japanese pumpkin or kabocha for the recipe.Register as a job seeker with Jobs in Childcare to access the latest governess, nanny, and tutor vacancies across the world.If you are an agency then sign up to post on Jobs in Childcare to connect with the best candidates worldwide!Share:Follow us on:FacebookTwitterLinkedIninstagramHomeContactAbout UsTerms & ConditionsEmployerPost a JobSearch ResumesSign inJob SeekerFind JobsCreate ResumeSign in"
