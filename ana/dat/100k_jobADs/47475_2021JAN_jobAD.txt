But we must keep the momentum going,” Barklamb said.“… we have this week begun inducting a group of Indigenous jobseekers on a fully-fundedCertificate II in Hospitality with the view to work at one of Western Australia’s mineaccommodation villages.“This follows another program where unemployed Indigenous people were trained andemployed in mine site security. These are real-life examples of what can be achieved whenindustry and government collaborate to support Indigenous employment.”In a submission to the Australian Government’s Review of Indigenous Training andEmployment, headed by FMG chairman Andrew Forrest, AMMA outlined opportunities forgovernment to expand on the resource industry’s track record of Indigenous participation.“As we manage the industry’s transition to greater levels of production and prepare for newprojects, the resource industry will continue to play a lead role in delivering jobs andeconomic growth,” Barklamb says.“Andrew Forrest’s review could also address the existing ambiguity around anti-discriminationlaws that can prevent employers from targeting job advertisements to Indigenous people.”AMMA’s submission also recommends better equipping Indigenous businesses to tender forresource industry work and preparing more Indigenous people to take up FIFO/DIDO roles.“An opportunity exists to research, promote and expand on successful resource industryinitiatives to further Indigenous employment prospects throughout our nation,” Barklambsaid.Share this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)TagsAMMA Andrew Forrest Australia DIDO Executive Director FIFO FMG Scott BarklambYou may also likeEntry level workers sought for multiple mine sites5 hours ago2 Min ReadCoal mine workers should transition to steel says resources mogul2 days ago2 Min ReadMining contractor starts hiring spree after winning tenders5 days ago2 Min ReadAdd CommentClick here to post a commentCancel replyCommentName *Email *WebsiteNotify me of follow-up comments by email.Notify me of new posts by email.Abbot Point coal terminal expansion to go ahead200 scientists join forces to oppose Abbot Point port expansionCommentShare This!FacebookTwitterLinkedInLooking for something?QMEB Latest EditionGold/Silver IndexRecent PostsEntry level workers sought for multiple mine sites2 Min ReadCoal mine workers should transition to steel says resources mogul2 Min ReadMining contractor starts hiring spree after winning tenders2 Min ReadMajor contract awarded for $2B Central Qld coal mine2 Min ReadMining contractor begins recruitment drive in North Qld1 Min ReadMiners will struggle to fill 20,000 jobs due to COVID says report2 Min ReadFuture unknown for $1.5B Central Qld coal project3 Min ReadAussie coal buyers ordered to find product elsewhere3 Min ReadAPRS MEDIAGarth Wright, Senior Account Manager: 0401 055 776AboutThe Queensland Mining and Energy Bulletin is an independent voice on mining and energy for anyone working in the Queensland mining and minerals industry.facebooktwitterlinkedinrssLooking for something?Privacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
