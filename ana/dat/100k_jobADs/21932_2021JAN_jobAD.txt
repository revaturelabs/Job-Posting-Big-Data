However, I am so happy to have completed my first week of training as a remote employee supporting customers for a tax preparation software company! The starting pay isn't the greatest, but without the cost of commuting, buying lunch out, etc I think it is doable. The first week of the New Year is giving me tremendous hope for future success, and hope that my fellow job seekers on this site have similar faith in good things to come. This particular sector is ramping up for a very busy season, and I would encourage interested persons to explore similar opportunities. I am with a staffing company currently, but have been assured that if my performance is good that I have an excellent chance of being hired on permanently. There was a reasonable equipment investment on my part (less than $100), and the company provided a computer, webcam and related items necessary for the job. Thankfully I have a spare bedroom set up as an office that is quiet and free of distractions-- and finally being put to good use!! Wishing everyone the best of luck; I know how tough it is out there, especially for those of us who have been out of the work force for a while....Show More12ShareSean LahornSean Lahornabout 4 years agoReportYou got skills!Good news.
