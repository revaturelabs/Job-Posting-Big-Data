All I have left is Naruto and Bleach, and while enjoyable at first both have fallen quite far from the quality they both started at.Honey and Clover is sadly over, and the ending was very unexpected for me.

It was a fun story. I really liked the overall story line, I thought they did a good job of developing it and adding in enough twists and turns to keep me interested.One of my biggest complaints was the fan service every female character, except for a couple, had the usual gravity defying chest and was matched with clothing that would shred in combat showing how much damage they were taking. It was way too much in partsI watched it on Hulu, so I don’t know if the following comments only apply to what Hulu carries.The other issue I had was with the dub. There was a dub for the first couple of seasons. The voice actors were really good and added to the story. Then for the middle chapters, only Sub - no dub, and for the last couple of chapters, they changed all of the voice actors and they were BAD. If I hadn’t been a couple hundred episodes in I would have never finished. And that’s too bad because I thought the ending did a great job of tying up the story. Is this common in long series to totally change the voice talent?Also, does anyone have any suggestions for something on Hulu, Netflix or Amazon that would be a good follow up to Fairy Tale?karmajayPosted: September 30, 2:22 PMPermalink0 to Zen in under 6 secondsNCBOFURI is on HuluPro is five years old.

I'm a little turned off by pervy anime in general... how far that direction does it go?The anime isn't pervy. The characters are. The paladin is an outrageous masochist, the priest is constantly trying to show off her sex appeal (it doesn't work on anyone, even the anime's audience), and the mage has a disturbing relationship with her explosion magic. None of this is fanservice. They're all goofs and it's played like that. An interesting amount of their actual moe (sex appeal) is because they're such ridiculous failures.Taharka wrote:Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!This one is super cute. I did like the take on overpowered reincarnation anime.I found this one interesting. Evidently, a significant fraction of the Japanese don't view power, fame, and wealth as universally desirable. This seems to be a cultural thing. What they want is a comfortable life, being completely unremarkable in every way, and enjoy the company of friends and family. So when the protagonist awakes in her next life being something of a monster prodigy, she keeps doing her straight level best to pass herself off as being average. She fails a lot at it.\"...mahal ko ang longganisa!\" - DemosthenesccesaranoPosted: October 2, 12:36 PMPermalinkPandering Otaku TrashSouf JoiseyMy brother and I finished My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU this week. We wanted to hold off on the last two episodes until we could watch 'em in one sitting. The show concluded far, far more nicely and cleanly than either of us had anticipated, as well as leaving a few loose ends or mysteries open. Nothing major, mostly just curiosities as to what might happen with certain characters or the history of some of their relationships.On the whole, though, I like how it ended. A lot of the show's concepts culminating into a proper ending. Considering I was expecting something bittersweet, or just plain bitter, it was nice for it to conclude happily with nothing feeling too Disney Princess Happy Ending.So yeah, I highly recommend the show.YouTube | Twitch | BlogSW-3864-9679-7572karmajayPosted: October 4, 8:34 PMPermalink0 to Zen in under 6 secondsNCoh snap new anime Jujutsu Kaisen ep 1 was good!Pro is five years old.

Because it's easily spoiled, I'll just say that A) I really, really liked the ending, and B) it's pretty much a complete story. I don't think there will be any more. At 12 episodes, it's not a huge investment, and I thought it was well worth the time.I've also been watching Re Zero.... man, that one is getting very, very weird. It started out as light fantasy, but it's much closer now to horror. It reminds me, just a little, of Puella Magi Madoka Magica, mostly because of the light->dark transition. Re Zero, however, is much, much longer, and without (at 38 episodes) any particular resolution in sight.Not sure whether to recommend it or not. Some of the later episodes were getting very hard to follow, too... the main character is making leaps of logic that, um, aren't very logical, and are leaving me rather baffled as to why he's choosing to do particular things. They're clearly correct decisions, I just don't always understand why he's making them. I feel like he has information I haven't been given.edit to add: The same with at least one of the support characters; their stated reasons for why they're doing things just don't make a lot of sense to me.Carl Sagan: \"Clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.\"AgathosPosted: October 5, 3:52 PMPermalinkExecutiveChicagoI hate to say it since I loved the first season, but Re:Zero feels like it's going in circles. In the first season he would make a little forward progress with each death. Now he's just stuck, and the shocking twists pile up so quickly that they start to blur together.manta173Posted: October 5, 7:31 PMPermalinkAbandoner of sentences...Decatur ALMalor wrote:manta173 wrote:Anyone watch Konsuba?

They went for the 'invent English dialog that matches the mouth movements' approach, so the phrasing can be a little odd sometimes. The first anime I ever saw that did this was Cowboy Bebop, all those years ago, and honestly, this one's quality is very close to that level. They capture the essence of what's going on just fine, and the voice actors are good enough to carry the occasionally awkward wording most of the time. (the underlying story's not as good as Bebop, but what is?)I still prefer the subbed version, but if you're allergic to those, the BOFURI dub is well done.Carl Sagan: \"Clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.\"MiddcorePosted: October 7, 6:43 AMPermalinkNothing amazingMiddle of the mapDon't think I've seen any discussion of the Netflix Dragon's Dogma anime, but it's somewhat appropriate to the \"anime that are sort of like D&D\" conversation, if your party is just two heroes having an adventure of the week.A review I saw scroll by somewhere described it as \"taking a charming game world and seeing only spite in it\" and there's an element of truth to that. The setting and storyline of the DD game certainly wasn't carefree and whimsical but it had its share of (maybe unintentional) humor and memetic qualities. The DD anime lacks any of that and is grim af. It doesn't take it to the gratuitous extremes of something like, say, Berserk or Goblin Slayer, but it's deadly serious with literally not a single moment that I can recall of anything like comic relief. It won't make you bored but it sure won't make you smile, either. I can't find any info from quick Googling on how much input the creative team behind the game had in this adaption - maybe this is the tone of the game's world they always envisioned and the game's comparative wackiness was basically an accident? Or maybe Netflix felt like their darker-and-edgier Castlevania adaption was pretty well-received and decided to put a similar spin on the source material here?Structurally it feels like it should have been a movie with a runtime in the 90 minute to two hours range rather than a series with just 7 episodes. 7 episodes doesn't give a lot of time for character development or interesting side stories, but they still spend almost the entire show doing monster/villain-of-the-week stuff that feels like the material a much longer series would just use to get rolling before the real plot begins. On the other hand, maybe they felt they had to pad it out with the episodic monster-slaying because there just isn't a whole lot going on here, plot-wise: guy's Beloved Peasant Village has dragon things happen to it, guy wants payback. It's not War and Peace. I certainly can't recommend anybody make it a priority to watch it, but if you have any sort of itch for some medieval fantasy action, it IS only 7 episodes so it's not as if it's a big time commitment.(More detailed discussion with spoilers under the button)Spoiler:So to give an example of what I mean: in episode 3 the protagonist and his \"Pawn\" companion encounter a married couple of traveling nobles being escorted by two knights. Noble husband is a fop too cowardly to defend his wife from goblins, and so noble wife (who only married her husband for his wealth which is now meaningless because the dragon wiped out his holdings) throws herself at the protagonist (he turns her down, still carrying the torch for his wife who got dragon BBQ'd in the first episode - he has no boners except a big old revenge boner). Then goblins attack again and hubby finally grows a pair, hacks down some gobbos, and saves his bride. So, happy ending, right? No, because then foppish noble guy murders his wife in a fit of jealousy over her hoe'ing it up, right when he'd finally earned her respect. Then, overcome by remorse he kills himself.Oh, and then if that weren't enough, the two knights, who seem like pretty decent guys, cross paths with the party again in episode 5 and at its conclusion THEY end up killing each other also, for reasons I won't bother to go into. Not to say that their motivations were entirely unbelievable, just that it's pretty clear the real reason for their mutual fratricide was that this is Dragon's Dogma and that kind of thing just happens in Dragon's Dogma. Have I mentioned the episodes are named after the Seven Deadly Sins? They are, because RRRGGGHHHH, BAD, DARKNESS, MISERY.I just finished episode 6 and when the credits rolled I was surprised because it felt like only half an episode, probably because about half of it is an extended flashback showing the protagonist's backstory before dragon stuff happened. The actual plot of the episode is a confrontation with a succubus which is basically just an excuse to get some tiddies in the show, there's no battle or investigation or twist to it at all. Succubus tries to seduce protagonist in the guise of his dead wife, he figures out what's going on, he kills succubus, the end. But OK, it's a character development episode, and tbf that's badly needed because to this point basically all we know about the hero is he's got major beef over his family getting dragon'd to death, so I can accept this for what it is and hope it's a sign the show is turning the corner from monster-of-the-week to more robust plot.Except then I look at wikipedia and realize for the first time the series is only 7 episodes long... I had been laboring under the misconception it was at least a \"standard\" 12 or 13. (Yes, the episode titles should have given me a clue, shut up.) Which means the next episode is going to be the climactic confrontation with the dragon?I feel like episodes 2-6 could have been totally different random groups of adventurers fighting the monster/villain in each installment for all of the impact they actually had on the protagonist's story. We could have smash-cut from him leaving the smoldering remains of his BPV directly to him arriving at the dragon's lair and basically missed nothing important.I also took in Netflix's Altered Carbon: Resleeved movie over the course of two nights, which I guess tells you something about how much it held my interest. I enjoyed the first season of the live-action Netflix Altered Carbon series a lot, and then gave up on the second season after about 3 episodes when it became painfully obvious that the showrunner and entire writing staff had been replaced and the budget had been zero'd out. But I was still interested enough in that universe and anything small-c cyberpunk to give Resleeved a try.It has a very... unique... animation style. Not bad unique, but not good unique where I'd say it's worth watching for the visuals alone either. The closest comparison I can make for what it looks like is that it reminded me for all the world of the character designs in Street Fighter 5. Once you get used to the visual style for better or for worse, the movie doesn't really have much to offer aside from some elaborately brutal action scenes. There's a tie-in to Takeshi's backstory and the main plot of the live-action series that gets revealed in the second half, but then they don't do anything with it, and there's no interesting exploration of the transhumanist themes of the setting here at all. The villain's scheme is pretty much literally the first thing you would think of a power-hungry villain dreaming up in a world where you can transfer your consciousness from one body to another.There's a hotel AI avatar character who seems to be in the movie just because people liked Poe in the live-action series a lot, the same way every Star Wars movie has to have a new droid. Part of the climax involves information being transmitted to the AI hotel guy which causes him to come to the aid of the heroes, information he treats as a paradigm-altering revelation, except that I am almost certain he was \"in the room\" when the exact same facts were explained in dialogue about five minutes before.Overall the whole thing feels like it was created by people who were just given a basic outline of the Altered Carbon setting with a few bullet points on stuff from the live-action series that got a good response from audiences and then spent most of their effort on the fight scenes. I thought they must have released this before the second season of the live-action series came out in February as a way to drum up interest and I had just missed it, but it looks like it actually came out a month later in March, which makes me suspect they knew it wasn't great and that the writing was already on the wall for the live-action series (although it wasn't officially cancelled until August) and they just shoved it out the door. If this is the end for on-screen adaptions of the Altered Carbon IP it certainly isn't going out on a high note.ccesaranoPosted: October 7, 2:10 PMPermalinkPandering Otaku TrashSouf JoiseyMiddcore wrote:Don't think I've seen any discussion of the Netflix Dragon's Dogma anime, but it's somewhat appropriate to the \"anime that are sort of like D&D\" conversation, if your party is just two heroes having an adventure of the week.I watched the first three episodes but haven't gone back to it. I wasn't surprised by the gritty tone, but the gore presentation and the sudden flopping about of bare boobs in the third episode kind of threw me off. Not exactly what I'm looking for in anime right now. I'll probably go back, but it'll be a slow burn that ultimately just makes me want to play the game again.And as you note, by the end of the third episode I could see the pattern emerge. Protagonist tries to accomplish something good, only for the people he saves to turn around and become monsters themselves. When you can predict a formula like that, it takes some of the enjoyment out of watching the show and all the events of the episode leading up to that climax. \"Boy, I can't wait to find out how all this effort to do good in the world is ruined by the inherent evil that is human nature\".I'm also not sure where \"boobs suddenly flopping about\" fall on the perversion scale. Most anime fan-service is about titillation and teasing while finding ways to maintain \"purity\" somehow. There are certain lines they won't cross that Americans actively will, and vice versa. Dragon's Dogma's use of boobage is far closer to Game of Thrones than what you get in anime, with the gore being closer to Castlevania. Combine this with allegations that Netflix wanted the live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender to be more \"mature\", with sex, violence, and blood, and it has me wondering if there are forces at work within the company trying to appeal to Game of Thrones sensibilities. I like the first two seasons of Castlevania, but I'm not partial to entrails flying about every which way. Blood I can do, guts are another manner. While anime has always been loaded with violence, it's more bloody than anything, with entrails and innards making barely an appearance. So it's a bit off-putting to see a Cyclops grab a guy by his lower half and pull, spilling his guts out quite visibly.Now, back in the 80's you started to see a lot of line-crossing because of OAV's. Without having to worry about television censorship guidelines, you saw more sexuality as well as greater degrees of violence. But it didn't feel as ...well, juvenile as it does here.Granted this is speculation based around allegations rather than confirmed facts, and there are plenty of examples of Netflix exclusive anime without this sort of edgelord line-crossing (Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045 for example). But whereas I was once excited about the sort of media Netflix was grabbing as exclusives, there's now a question of whether they're putting pressure on their creatives to try and grab all the wrong elements of Game of Thrones. If they are, then is Dragon's Dogma one such product that was made more pessimistic, cynical, bloody, and sexual than necessary?Only time will tell, I suppose. Until then, a Discord I'm in has voted on Children of the Whales as October's anime of the month, so I'll be starting that some time soon-ish.YouTube | Twitch | BlogSW-3864-9679-7572GrennPosted: October 7, 2:41 PMPermalinkAwesomeville CrierSitting uncomfortably close to your girlfriendI bought Dragon's Dogma three times. Original on Xbox and Dark Arisen on PS3 and PC. I have hundreds of hours in all three. My level in Xbox and PS3 is in the 180-190 range and my PC character is 200 with the absolute best gear for a ranger/strider (complete Oblivion set Gold Rarified with the best bonus enchantments on all) as well as all the other BBI level 3 gear and armor not yet optimized. That's two sets of each, one for myself and one for my pawn.And even I can't be bothered to finish the anime.From the story to the animation the Dragon's Dogma anime is a letdown. I was hoping the story would be about the Duke. There's some interesting lore to examine there and since one of the game's failings was the storytelling, you'd think that an anime would be an ideal way to expand on that. Yet here we are.

I can't remember which episode it is but there's at least one instance where somebody recognizes that Ethan is an Arisen. Sooo... this has happened before then? It's a thing people know about? How many Arisens has the average person met in their lifetimes exactly? But no it seems like that one 10-second exchange is all we get.master0Posted: October 7, 10:15 PMPermalinkSlave0That's disappointing. I love Dragon's Dogma, and none of your descriptions makes me want to watch it all. The game had some dark moments. Actually like maybe two or three tops now that I think about it. Still it was far from game of thrones grittiness overall. It's not really suited to low fantasy. It's literally a quest about revenge to slay a dragon and grand prophecy/cycle. That's pretty high fantasy. Ah well.\"Go for the eyes Boo, GO FOR THE EYES!!

Cool world building.Then you enjoyed the entirety of Burn the Witch. I twas only planned for three episodes.Feels like there are a lot of anime out this season, likely because last season was so slim. Here's what I've checked out so far:Good first showing:Jujutsu Kaisen - This one just oozes that Shonen Jump feel, which is fine since that is where it is from, and that's not a bad thing. The settings and characters were interesting, it hooked us in with hints of the larger conflicts our hero faces, and was well animated.Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle - A princess is kidnapped by a demon lord, has nothing to do while in captivity but sleep. Unfortunately she can't get a good night rest, so she ends up terrorizing the demon lord's castle in a a series of quests to upgrade her sleeping arrangements. I found it quirky and delightful to watch.Talentless Nana - My thoughts as I watched the first episode: \"Huh, interesting, but why is it called Talentless Nana? So far it's pretty good, but the title doesn't make sense. Oh! So that's... HOLY CRAP!\" Yeah, it ending with quite the hook.Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina - Another fantasy-themed journey/slice-of-life anime. The first episode was just setting up the origins of our heroine, but I got the vibes from it that I hoped it have, a bit of a mixture of Kino's Journey, Flying Witch, and perhaps a bit of Little Witch Academia. The first episode felt crammed full of story beats as they checked off her backstory, so I hope the following episodes slow the story down a bit and fall into a steady pacing that really helps us enjoy the characters, situations, and stories.Has potential:I'm Standing on a Million Lives - Started off as a fairly modern isekai where the protagonists and dragged into another world with no real advantages. Much of it was the main character learning the basics of the world he had been pulled into. The hook at the ending is what made it interesting and set up the reasoning behind the title. Future episodes might make this a pretty interesting series to watch.Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear - It was just quirkly and strange enough to keep me entertained. The synopsis of the series tells me that as strong as our oddly dressed main character was, it isn't going to last, and that might make the anime interesting in addition to quirky and strange.Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World - What little I knew about this anime before watching it lead me to believe it was going to be a bit of a super-power version of Romeo and Juliette... and it is! Lots of exposition from the characters in the first episode and not much to make the series stand out, except for the beginning hints of romance between our leads, which is what is either going to sell me on the series of make me move it to the lower tiers.TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You - A bit of a strange Romcom (I mean, they are married the second time they meet), but it was cute and had a relaxing pacing. I'll probably enjoy it even if it continues like the first episode, but there is potential for it to become a sweet, charming, and heartwarming story.Meh:Assault Lily BOUQUET - Overall, I'm not sure there was anything special about this anime. I loved the weapon designs, with how smoothly switched between ranged and melee weapons, but nothing that really pushed it above dozens of other similar series I've watched.By the Grace of the Gods - Ok, I waffed a bit on if this one should be here or in the list above. I think it had an interesting setting and main character, but it looks like it'll just become an isekai harem anime. It certainly has some hope of gaining ground with the main character learning to be a part of society and/or with some romance, but the first episode didn't give me much hope of the story getting heavy with either theme.Rail Romanesque - Moe train girls. I mean the designs are cute, and looking up the trains they are based on I can see the inspirations, but nothing really grabbed my interest in the first episode. The only reason I might watch the whole this is that the episodes are only 4 minutes long.Returning:Higurashi: When They Cry - NEW - A remake of the 2006 anime. It looks great and (I'm told) is more faithful to the original visual novel. Honestly I loved the original and I'm glad to have a much better looking version of it. Watched episode 2. It’s a bloody continuation of the series that revisits the original!Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? III - Another series I'm happy to have more of! Been curious how the new character from the previous season would fit in with the cast.master0Posted: October 8, 8:19 PMPermalinkSlave0Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle - I'm have surprised this got an adaptation. That said this was always genuinely funny when I read it. Good for a laugh if not for an overall story.Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear - Your right on this one. I felt the story petered out on this one. Besides the bear motif its pretty standard slice of life isekai.\"Go for the eyes Boo, GO FOR THE EYES!!

The synopsis I was referring to (I bolded the part we didn't see in episode 1):Spoiler:Yuna's not your typical 15-year-old. First, she's crazy rich from playing the stock market. Second, she's a recluse obsessed with a VRMMO game, and she's really good at that too. Her life is pretty much perfect—until she wakes up one day inside the game she loves and back at level one. She has to start over, but this time, she has a powerful bear suit that's guaranteed to take her places!Still, I feel it will have to come as quite a blow to Yuna to really make the show interesting.MiddcorePosted: October 8, 10:13 PMPermalinkNothing amazingMiddle of the mapTo close the book on the Dragon's Dogma discussion...Spoiler:In the final episode we finally get to the whole Arisen/dragon destiny cycle thing, and Ethan and the dragon have a philosophical discussion of sorts. The dragon's position boils down to \"Humans suck but they can't be otherwise, I kill humans because I can't do otherwise, and now you're killing me because you can't do otherwise,\" and there's basically nothing that refutes him. He admits he killed Ethan's family expressly to provoke Ethan into setting off on a revenge quest against him because he wants to die, which means the whole show was sort of the dragon committing suicide by cop? And because Ethan was consumed by his desire for vengeance that means he is guilty of \"pride\" and doomed to become the next dragon. One wonders what exactly he was supposed to do that would have broken the cycle, just accept the wanton murder of his family and destruction of his home with zen-like tranquility I suppose?In conclusion this show is kind of f*ckin' dumb. The game had a fairly goofyass plot with a lot of half-formed concepts, but it was goofyass in a likable way. Then this (mini)series inexplicably decided what was missing was a big helping of artlessly argued nihilism.Pages« first‹ previous…344345346347348349350351352next ›last »You are hereHome » Forums » Everything Else"
