According to an article by Network World, while recruitment software makes it easier for those in the HR department, it also may overlook some qualifications that would be noticed on traditional resumes.Many recruiting software companies offer capabilities that range from recruiting to hiring to employee career development and training. The software, usually an SaaS model, allows recruiters and hiring managers to search out ideal candidates and allows job seekers to search listings, submit resumes and learn about companies.“Especially in a period with an abundance of applicants, the automated recruiting process helps hiring managers focus on the most qualified candidates,” Angel Cabrera, CTO of Vurv Technology, said in the article. “If there is no automation, you are diluting the experience for all the candidates because the human element cannot keep up or give attention to those that could best fit the position.”However, many people in the IT field think the software can be manipulated by some applicants. People also argue it’s impossible to get hired unless the items on your resume exactly match what a company wants.“The problem with the IT job market today is you aren’t even dealing with humans,” Terri Morgan, a principal at Wudang Research Association, said in the article. “In IT, most people can learn new skills. That is what sets humans apart; we have the capacity to learn.”Posted in Industry, TopicsTagged pcrecruiter, Recruitment softwarePost navigationCandidate Tracking – Benefits to Job SeekersApplicant Tracking System – What Is It?Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
