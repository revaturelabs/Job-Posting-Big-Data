Comedy’s job is to point out that it doesn’t make sense, and that it doesn’t make much difference anyway.” ~ Eric IdleThoughts, opinions, ideas?

Here you will find posts on just about anything, from the mundane to the insane, the outlandish to the sublime. I include a wide selection of quotes, images and music in most of my posts. If I am unable to present new content, I rely on that old favorite—the reblog. Be forewarned: I am a left-leaning, liberal, feminist who does not hesitate to speak my mind. Enjoy.(Not much other social media for me except for my tumblr, Frenzy and Lightning, which you can visit here or below.) And you can find my various product reviews on Influenster here.Contact Me Herepoietes1@yahoo.comCopyright ©2008-2020 poietes.wordpress.comLolita Liwag. All rights reserved.
