Please note that as part of the survey process, panelists view static images of the actual tweets, not the transcriptions of the tweet texts presented in the results. Sometimes, President Trump uses more than two or three tweets to continue a longer message. On those occasions, panelists view and rate the complete tweet thread as a whole.Explore the dataFeel free to explore today's Presidential job approval and tweet rating data in the widget below:Trump TweetsTweet IndexYou can review the history of our ratings of President Trump's tweets back to February 2017 on our YouGov TweetIndex.How is President Trump doing on handling Coronavirus?About YouGovAt the heart of our company is a global online community, where millions of people and thousands of political, cultural and commercial organizations engage in a continuous conversation about their beliefs, behaviors and brands.CompanyAbout YouGovContact UsCareersInvestor relationsPress OfficeSupportGlobal SitesAustraliaAustriaBrazilCanadaDenmarkFinlandFranceGermanyHong KongIndiaIndonesiaItalyMalaysiaMexicoMiddle EastNorwayPakistanPhilippinesPolandSingaporeSpainSwedenSwitzerlandTaiwanThailandTurkeyUnited KingdomUnited StatesVietnamAt the heart of our company is a global online community, where millions of people and thousands of political, cultural and commercial organizations engage in a continuous conversation about their beliefs, behaviors and brands.CompanyAbout YouGovContact UsCareersInvestor relationsPress OfficeSupportGlobal SitesAustraliaAustriaBrazilCanadaDenmarkFinlandFranceGermanyHong KongIndiaIndonesiaItalyMalaysiaMexicoMiddle EastNorwayPakistanPhilippinesPolandSingaporeSpainSwedenSwitzerlandTaiwanThailandTurkeyUnited KingdomUnited StatesVietnamCopyright Â© 2018 YouGov PLC.
