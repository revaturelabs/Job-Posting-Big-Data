The ‘Carlow Town Team Revitalisation Programme’, which has been launched this morning by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Richard Bruton TD, features seven key supports with an investment of over €130,000.“This is a very ambitious and encouraging plan which has the potential to provide a significant boost to Carlow town. The plan, which is backed by Retail Excellence Ireland, includes:·A ‘Rates Incentive Grant Scheme’, offering up to 5% off commercial rates for 2014;·The ‘Vacant Property Retail Incentive Scheme’, to cover store fit-out and shop front improvements;·An ‘Art, Craft and Food Shop’ incentive scheme;·A ‘Pop-Up’ scheme for temporary retail space;·A ‘Retail Development Programme’ to improve retail skills of store owners;·A ‘Start Your Own Retail Business’ workshop for those thinking of opening up a new retail outlet locally.“The plan is being rolled out by a number of local organisations which are working together for the betterment of Carlow. This includes the Carlow County Enterprise Board, the Local Authorities, the Chamber of Commerce and IT Carlow.“First and foremost, the programme aims to improve the retail environment for existing businesses and to encourage new retailers to come to Carlow. It’s a great example of what can be delivered if local groups work together.“New businesses are playing an increasingly important role in Ireland’s economic recovery. Two-thirds of all new jobs come from start-up businesses in the first five years of their existence, so the Government fully recognises how important it is to help get new enterprises up and running.“Carlow and the surrounding areas have a fast growing population. It’s essential that local businesses are in a prime position to benefit from this population surge. This Revitalisation Programme, through its incentives and supports, will help retailers to take advantage of the economic upturn, and will help local job creation as a result.”Fine Gael NewsAn error has occurred, which probably means the feed is down.
