And a joke from the archives.Posted on March 26, 2019 by Smorgasbord - Variety is the Spice of Life.	We all have days when our jobs get us down, but some people have it far worse….And a joke from the archives….on the subject of jobs…SalesmanshipSid was told if he did not sell more toothbrushes he would be fired. One month later his sales record had soared and his manager called him in to explain the dramatic turnaround.Sid explained that he had got tired of calling at pharmacies and had set up a little stall at the main train station with some crackers and a new dip.‘Try my dip,’ he would say, and a constant stream of people did so. When they enquired about the ingredients of the dip, Sid told them: ‘Garlic and Chicken poop!’They would go ‘Aaaargh!’ and spit it out.Then Sid would say: ‘Would you like to buy a toothbrush?’Thanks for dropping in today and I hope you are leaving with a smile on your face….. thanks Sally.Share this:TwitterRedditWhatsAppPinterestTumblrEmailLinkedInPrintFacebookLike this:Like Loading...RelatedThis entry was posted in It is a Wonderful Life., Smorgasbord Laughter Lines and tagged funnies, health and safety jokes by Smorgasbord - Variety is the Spice of Life..
