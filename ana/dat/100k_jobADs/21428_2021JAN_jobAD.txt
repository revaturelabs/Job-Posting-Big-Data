"Data protection and privacy notices - Moortown Primary School, Leeds0113 268 5915|[email protected]Find OutJoin InLearn MoreMoortown Primary is a ‘single-form entry’ school. This means we take only one class each year and so have one class in each year group. Classes are limited to a maximum of 30 children in Reception, Year 1 and 2 (like all schools), and classes in Years 3 to 6 are usually around this size, too.Key information about the day-to-day running of Moortown Primary School can be found here – everything from the price of a school dinner to important dates in the school year.
