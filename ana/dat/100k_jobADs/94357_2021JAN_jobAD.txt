I'm seeing rave reviews from a lot of people that I trust. Like game of the year type stuff.So what is it?A free-to-play gacha game.Um?Also, it's like Breath of the WildWhat?!But like, more animeExcuse me?Also you can play it on your phone if you want (also PC and PS4)This really isn't helping?I knowAcidCatPosted: October 2, 3:55 PMPermalinkSchrödinger's 3rd optionBellingham WABeen playing on PS4 since it released, it's a really fun, polished game.

The story and characters are all pretty basic, I'd say in that respect it's almost aimed at a younger audience. The combat, at least at lower levels, can be accomplished using basic attacks. While anime-styled, none of the characters (that I've seen so far) are oversexualized. The only issues I'd see are some of the game systems may be kinda complex for younger kids, there's a lot going on under the hood in terms of how you upgrade your characters and weapons and your overall adventure level, as well as different currencies you earn and what they do.PSN: MossybrewDarkhaundPosted: October 2, 8:51 PMPermalinkTales of WolfHow bad is the gacha ?Is it free to get on the PS4?Can i GET IT for the VITA?The Lone Dark WolfTyrianPosted: October 2, 9:11 PMPermalinkNOT TO SCALE!Kitty Hawk, NCDarkhaund wrote:How bad is the gacha ?Is it free to get on the PS4?Can i GET IT for the VITA?I'm too early to know how bad the gacha stuff is.. but I'm not hurting for loot or activities so far.

The game (at least for me) on the PS4 seems very buggy.. It lags on the \"bridge\" startup screen and has frozen at least 3 times at random intervals.

Gets a little bit slow if you're in a tree and looking through a lot of foliage, but nothing too bad. I had it on PC for awhile and it seemed to work pretty well there.DarkhaundPosted: October 3, 6:35 PMPermalinkTales of WolfMy son it having a decent good time.. I will see... game looks ok.The Lone Dark WolfTyrianPosted: October 3, 8:05 PMPermalinkNOT TO SCALE!Kitty Hawk, NCI've had the game crash my PS4 once (I'd logged out of the game, but suspended the PS4 to rest mode). When I resumed the game, it dropped the console to an unresponsive hi-resolution picture of \"snow\". I had to hard reset the device!Other than that, I can also report the semi-sluggish behavior when looking through foliage. I also sometimes see a lag when the game wants to present me with a world interactable (resource, button to press, etc) but it's reasonably responsive overall.Definitely enjoying my time so far. I've not spent any in-game resources on pulls, and have progressed to AR 12.Splitting time between the PS4 and PC is still annoying. I wish they'd allowed cross-platform progression (dammit Sony).PSN: GrakargXBLA: GrakargSteam: [GWJ] TyriankenadaPosted: October 4, 3:29 AMPermalinkConsultantColumbus, OHI played miHoYo’s other game (Honkai Impact 3rd) for a while. That game was fun, but it eventually got overwhelming with all the random lifestuff crap they added (and the story got pretty stupid too). I thought thought the gacha in Honkai Impact 3rd was okay, so I’m not too worried about the one here since it looks pretty similar. If it’s like other ones gacha games I’ve played (Honkai Impact 3rd, epic7, Granblue Fantasy), the way to go if you’re F2P (or just buying the bundle) is to stockpile fates until you have enough to guarantee a pity pull when a banner you want shows up.I’ve been playing this on my iPhone. It runs pretty well and looks very nice. I tend to get lost just exploring, so I only just hit AR 10 tonight. I did do both Beginners’ pulls. I got Noelle, who is guaranteed, and Xingqiu. I’ve also been really enjoying the interaction with Paimon. The ditzy sidekick is a pretty common trope in these games, but her VA does a good job, and the responses you can give are great (mmm, emergency food supply).Update: After reading a bit on reddit, I went back and reread the rules for the gacha. It’s a bit different from other games I’ve played. The way it works is the first 4★ or 5★ has a 50% chance of being one of the banner characters. The second one is guaranteed to be one of the characters (or items, depending on the banner). That means if you pity without getting a 5★, then you only have a 50% chance of getting the banner character on the pity pull. You should be prepared to pity twice if you want to be guaranteed the character.kazookaPosted: October 4, 4:02 AMPermalinkDo not block this end holePortland, ORkenada, what does \"pity pull\" mean for those of us who have never really played a gacha game?steinkrugPosted: October 4, 11:11 AMPermalinkTrails brought me hereNYI tried it for about 90min yesterday. Ran pretty well on PS4 Pro.The elemental aspect of the combat helps keep things a bit interesting. Of the two temples I did, I thought maybe it held your hand too much on how to overcome the obstacles.So far the story seems pretty generic, too, though the VA is mostly decent.Impressive for a F2P game, but I’m not totally won over yet.backloggerykenadaPosted: October 4, 1:42 PMPermalinkConsultantColumbus, OHkazooka wrote:kenada, what does \"pity pull\" mean for those of us who have never really played a gacha game?A “pity pull” is a pull with a guaranteed result. It effectively puts a cap on the number of attempts it takes to get a character or item.On the rotating banner here, that’s 180 pulls. You do have a 50% chance at 90 pulls, but you need to plan for 180 pulls to guarantee a character.I haven’t unlocked everything yet, so I went reading. Currently, there is no other way to get Stella Fortuna for 5★ characters except through dupes. That makes fully upgrading a 5★ pretty expensive.I hope they add a shard system like their other game has, especially since unlocks are tied to level caps. Otherwise, I can’t see myself really getting much out of 5★ characters. I’ll pay some money, but I generally won’t just to upgrade a character.DarkhaundPosted: October 4, 4:19 PMPermalinkTales of WolfMy PS4 went \"blank\" I had to unplug it for it ot work again. it had never done that before.... this game .... i dont know... ayone else have any comments?The Lone Dark WolfClockworkHousePosted: October 4, 6:07 PMPermalinkFake Gamer Girlthey/them, she/herDarkhaund wrote:My PS4 went \"blank\" I had to unplug it for it ot work again. it had never done that before.... this game .... i dont know... ayone else have any comments?Are you on a standard PS4 or a PS4 Pro? On the Pro, I've had a couple hitches in really busy areas, but it's otherwise been fine. I can't speak to the standard console hardware.You can always try reinstalling in case the installation is corrupted.If I'm ever in legal trouble I want my lawyer to defend me like gamers defend Valve. -TheGameguru14 - 9 - 13 - 8 - 12 - 7 - 6ClockworkHousePosted: October 4, 6:13 PMPermalinkFake Gamer Girlthey/them, she/herAs far as the game itself goes, my impression of it from screenshots was that it was a knock-off of Breath of the Wild. But after playing it for five or so hours (and a few hundred in Breath of the Wild, for comparison sake), my impression is that while it might look a hell of a lot like Breath of the Wild, it doesn't play much like it. If you don't have a Nintendo console and you want that Zelda fix, this really isn't the game to give it to you.But it is fun! It's a pretty solid B-tier JRPG, and the gacha system seems surprisingly generous. That might just be a launch thing, but I've been surprised. I'm certain that I'm playing the game suboptimally, but it's been really enjoyable.If I'm ever in legal trouble I want my lawyer to defend me like gamers defend Valve. -TheGameguru14 - 9 - 13 - 8 - 12 - 7 - 6AgathosPosted: October 4, 6:18 PMPermalinkExecutiveChicagoI played a bit last night and this morning on a PS4 Pro, just enough to finish the 3 temples. Because I saw your comment, I've been stopping (not suspending) the game after a session. I haven't experienced any crashes. Frame rates dropped a bit when there was a lot of terrain on the screen, but that was rare and no worse than in Korok Forest in Breath of the Wild.vyprePosted: October 5, 1:16 AMPermalinkCivil SerpentApple Tree Heights, Garden of EdenI’m playing on an iPhone XS+ running iOS14 and haven’t had a single bug, crash, or other issue.
