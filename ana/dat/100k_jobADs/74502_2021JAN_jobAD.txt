There is a saying that ‘life is like a ladder’. This phrase often brings to our minds the images of determined folks stepping on each other’s hands in a mad scramble to the top. But in reality we all have our own ladders, and we all make progress at our own pace. Hence it can be said that our success is measured against our own accomplishments, and not anyone else’s.TimesJobs discusses some confessions of few employees of reputed IT companies who went through the same situation. Let’s pay an aid to their take on this situation and what they think is apt to do in such circumstances to keep themselves motivated.Deepak Pandey who works with Hexaware Technologies, Navi Mumbai says:“I always encourage myself to figure out my next move, being stuck in past will bring nothing but sadness. Initially it might be disturbing, but as the time passes by, the attached feeling to that particular emotion also passes by.Moreover, the work pressure is such, that it’s difficult to bawl over one passing event of life which I could not be a part of”.Aditi Semwal who works with Infosys, Delhi says:“I tell myself that when more than one person competes for a single position, only one person can gain it. Hence it is importance that we address our feelings of jealousy, anger and discouragement quite efficiently”.Ruchira Berde who works with Wipro Vadodara says:“To start, I believe in the policy of -Act instead of complain. Hence, for me the work efficiency is the priority. So if possible, you can go and have a talk with the decision maker and you will get the answer why the selected person was given that post and not you. Once you get to know the reason, you will understand where you lack”.Adil Ansari who works with HCL Technologies, Bangalore says:“Having an attitude of self-assessment can help you grow better in the long run. So I bring back my focus on my current position to strengthen the areas in which I can grow”.Hope the confessions of these employees will help you tackle and boost back your energy in case you get or already are facing the same situation.
