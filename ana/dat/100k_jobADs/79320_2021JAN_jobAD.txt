Currently, there are more than 110,000 participants in the study.The MyCode Study was launched in 2014 by Geisinger in collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In the MyCode Study, patient-participants have consented to have parts of their genomes read or analyzed – the technical term is “sequenced.” That part of the genome being sequenced in the study is known as the exome — therefore, technical specialists refer to the MyCode Study as a “whole exome study” or “WES” study. The exome is that part of the genome that is responsible for protein coding, which give instructions on the function of a gene. It is the richest target for health and disease-related information in the genome. The information gleaned will contribute to a broad range of research aimed at understanding, preventing or improving treatments for disease. The goal is to help improve health care by finding ways to diagnose medical conditions earlier or before they appear and also to help find new treatments or medications to manage these diseases.More About the MyCode StudyThe Geisinger-Regeneron collaboration in the MyCode Study is the largest whole exome-sequencing* project in the US that 1) is linked to the electronic health records of a single, integrated healthcare delivery system and 2) which makes a commitment to return the genetic results to the research participants.Geisinger’s genomic research program offers some unique features, including:An unusually stable population of three or more generations providing enhanced capabilities for longitudinal research studies.Comprehensive electronic health information going back 20 years; enabling research to match gene variants (genotypes) with health symptoms/outcomes (phenotypes) over long periods of time.A full opt-in consenting process for participants that meets modern standards for biobanking and genomics.Broad permission for recontact with our engaged patient-participant population.A commitment to return of clinically actionable**, sometimes life-saving, results to patients, their children and grandchildren.*The exome is that part of the genome that encodes proteins and is the richest target for health and disease-related information.**Geisinger has established criteria specifying which findings are ‘clinically actionable’ and reported back to patient-participants.Open JobsPhysician OBGYN HospitalistWilkes-Barre, PennsylvaniaMultimodality TechnologistJersey Shore, PennsylvaniaAnesthesiology PhysicianWilkes-Barre, PennsylvaniaRN - Clinical Access Specialist Registered NurseWilkes-Barre, PennsylvaniaPhysician Assistant - OrthopaedicsWilkes-Barre, PennsylvaniaRN - Clinical Access Specialist Registered NurseDanville, PennsylvaniaPhysician Assistant OrthopaedicsLewistown, PennsylvaniaAmbulatory Surgical TechnologistDanville, PennsylvaniaPulmonary with Critical Care PhysicianWilkes-Barre, PennsylvaniaNeuro Oncology - PhysicianWilkes-Barre, PennsylvaniaEkg TechScranton, PennsylvaniaPhysician Plastic SurgeryWilkes-Barre, PennsylvaniaView All 25 Jobs	Set up a Job Alert to be notified when Geisinger posts new jobs.Back to TopErrorCloseContinueYou do not have JavaScript Enabled on this browser.
