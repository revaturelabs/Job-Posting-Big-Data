The median represents the middle salary value. Generally speaking, you would want to be on the right side of the graph with the group earning more than the median salary.PercentilesClosely related to the median are two values: the 25th and the 75th percentiles. Reading from the salary distribution diagram, 25% of people working in Engineering are earning less than 590 KWD while 75% of them are earning more than 590 KWD. Also from the diagram, 75% of people working in Engineering are earning less than 1,490 KWD while 25% are earning more than 1,490 KWD.What is the difference between the median and the average salary?Both are indicators. If your salary is higher than both of the average and the median then you are doing very well. If your salary is lower than both, then many people are earning more than you and there is plenty of room for improvement. If your wage is between the average and the median, then things can be a bit complicated. We wrote a guide to explain all about the different scenarios.

We compared the salaries of professionals at the same level but with different college degrees levels across many jobs, below are our findings.Change in salary based on education varies drastically from one location to another and depends hugely on the career field as well. The data displayed here is the combined average of multiple jobs. To view accurate figures, choose a specific job title.Workers with a certificate or diploma earn on average 17% more than their peers who only reached the high school level.Employees who earned a Bachelor's Degree earn 24% more than those who only managed to attain a cerificate or diploma.Professionals who attained a Master's Degree are awarded salaries that are 29% more than those with a Bachelor's Degree.Finally, PhD holders earn 23% more than Master's Degree holders on average while doing the same job.Is a Master's degree or an MBA worth it? Should you pursue higher education?A Master's degree program or any post-graduate program in Kuwait costs anywhere from 6,320 Kuwaiti Dinar(s) to 19,000 Kuwaiti Dinar(s) and lasts approximately two years. That is quite an investment.You can't really expect any salary increases during the study period, assuming you already have a job. In most cases, a salary review is conducted once education is completed and the degree has been attained.Many people pursue higher education as a tactic to switch into a higher paying job. The numbers seem to support this tactic. The average increase in compensation while changing jobs is approximately 10% more than the customary salary increment.The decision really depends on your situation and experience among many other factors. Putting all variables aside, if you can afford the costs of higher education then the return on investment is definitely worth it. You should be able to recover the costs in roughly a year or so.Top 10 Highest Paying Careers in KuwaitSee Full ListEngineering Salary Comparison By GenderShare This ChartTweet Get Chart Linkhttp://www.salaryexplorer.com/charts/kuwait/engineering/salary-comparison-by-gender-monthly-kuwait-engineering.jpgThough gender should not have an effect on pay, in reality, it does.

The people who get the highest bonuses are usually somehow involved in the revenue generation cycle.69% of surveyed staff in Engineering reported that they haven't received any bonuses or incentives in the previous year while 31% said that they received at least one form of monetary bonus.Those who got bonuses reported rates ranging from 4% to 5% of their annual salary.Received Bonus31%No Bonus69%Types of Bonuses ConsideredIndividual Performance-Based BonusesThe most standard form of bonus where the employee is awarded based on their exceptional performance.Company Performance BonusesOccasionally, some companies like to celebrate excess earnings and profits with their staff collectively in the form of bonuses that are granted to everyone. The amount of the bonus will probably be different from person to person depending on their role within the organization.Goal-Based BonusesGranted upon achieving an important goal or milestone.Holiday / End of Year BonusesThese types of bonuses are given without a reason and usually resemble an appreciation token.Bonuses Are Not Commissions!People tend to confuse bonuses with commissions. A commission is a prefixed rate at which someone gets paid for items sold or deals completed while a bonus is in most cases arbitrary and unplanned.What makes a position worthy of good bonuses and a high salary?The main two types of jobsRevenue Generators Supporting CastEmployees that are directly involved in generating revenue or profit for the organization. Their field of expertise usually matches the type of business.Employees that support and facilitate the work of revenue generators. Their expertise is usually different from that of the core business operations.Example:A graphics designer working for a graphics designing company.Example:A graphic designer in the marketing department of a hospital.Revenue generators usually get more and higher bonuses, higher salaries, and more frequent salary increments. The reason is quite simple: it is easier to quantify your value to the company in monetary terms when you participate in revenue generation.“Try to work for companies where your skills can generate revenue. We can't all generate revenue and that's perfectly fine.”Bonus Comparison by Seniority LevelTop management personnel and senior employees naturally exhibit higher bonus rates and frequencies than juniors. This is very predictable due to the inherent responsibilities of being higher in the hierarchy. People in top positions can easily get double or triple bonus rates than employees down the pyramid.21 High Paying Jobs That Don't Require a College Degree!Check The ListEngineering Hourly Average Wage in Kuwait6 KWD per hourThe average hourly wage (pay per hour) in Kuwait is 6 KWD. This means that the average person in Kuwait earns approximately 6 KWD for every worked hour.Hourly Wage = Annual Salary ÷ ( 52 x 5 x 8 )The hourly wage is the salary paid in one worked hour. Usually jobs are classified into two categories: salaried jobs and hourly jobs. Salaried jobs pay a fix amount regardless of the hours worked. Hourly jobs pay per worked hour. To convert salary into hourly wage the above formula is used (assuming 5 working days in a week and 8 working hours per day which is the standard for most jobs). The hourly wage calculation may differ slightly depending on the worked hours per week and the annual vacation allowance. The figures mentioned above are good approximations and are considered to be the standard. One major difference between salaried employees and hourly paid employees is overtime eligibility. Salaried employees are usually exempt from overtime as opposed to hourly paid staff.Engineering VS Other JobsShare This ChartTweet Get Chart Linkhttp://www.salaryexplorer.com/charts/kuwait/engineering/salary-comparison-between-engineering-and-engineering-monthly-kuwait.jpgThe average salary for Engineering is 16% less than that of All Jobs.Government vs Private Sector Salary ComparisonWhere can you get paid more, working for a private company or for the government?
