You’d think he would want to help his brother since nepotism is the word. Didn’t check your qualifications and all that ryt? Don’t worry he would regret not helping, but by then you wouldnt need it.

Thanks and God blessLog in to ReplyChime221 (@Chime221)October 18, 2013 at 4:36 amThe title didn’t help at all, I was warming up to read an article on job search! º°˚˚˚°ºнihihihihihihº°˚˚˚°º‎˚But seriously, this kind of situation is prevalent in most families…elderly and more successful ones, not lending a helping hand to younger ones.Nice read.Log in to ReplyTola Odejayi (@TolaO)October 26, 2013 at 11:04 pm@samueldpoetry,I think that it’s OK for people in privileged positions to help their friends/relatives who need help, but it should NOT just be because they are their friends/relatives; they should ALSO have qualifications to do the job.At best, the connection should grant them the interview, but not necessarily the position.Unfortunately, that’s not often the case.Log in to ReplyLeave a Reply Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment.LoginUsernamePasswordRemember MeRegisterLost PasswordReceive NaijaStories in your InboxEnter your email address: Delivered by FeedBurnerWriting OpportunitiesLooking for help with your essay?
