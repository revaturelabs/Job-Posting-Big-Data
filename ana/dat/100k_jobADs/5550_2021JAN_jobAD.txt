Send us an email: [email protected]CultureWhy Spreadsheets?Spreadsheets are one of the hardest things you can build — right up there with compilers. To succeed, you need technical excellence on the backend, paired with utter obsessiveness on the frontend, partnered with a genuine empathy for users. As scaffolding for the mind used by more than 1 billion people, spreadsheets are one of the few applications that can have a universal impact on people's daily lives.Sourcetable is a spreadsheet that syncs to your data. Our goal is to democratize information access so everyone can understand their data and make better decisions. We are a group of experienced founders, engineers and designers on a mission to build products to reach this goal. Execution will demand focus, resourcefulness and creativity. (A good sense of humor helps, but is not required.)Simple is hardFor most people, accessing their data in a spreadsheet is just far too hard using existing solutions. This is such a common yet overlooked problem that we're rebuilding spreadsheets from the ground up with data as a first class citizen. Some might call this excessive, while many simply won't understand. We know it's worth sweating the small stuff when it comes to making things simple.Bay Area Company — Remote WelcomePush code from anywhere you like, just keep the bar high.
