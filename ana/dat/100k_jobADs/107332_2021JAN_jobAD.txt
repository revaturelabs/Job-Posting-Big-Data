How about a new job?by nwoulfeNathan WoulfeFull Profile16th Jan 2013 5:14 AM0DID your new year resolution involve a change of career? If it did, and you're already making inroads on seeing it through, congratulations.If you're still trying to get that plan in motion, don't worry, there's a long way to go before you need to strike that resolution off as unfulfilled.Taking a bit more time around a decision as large as a career change can only be a good thing.You don't want to rush into it, make a snap decision, and in six months' time realise it was the wrong choice. Think it through, weigh up the options, do your research and then make an informed decision.Professional resume writer and HR expert Amanda McCarthy said taking the time to research your desired role can save you from nasty surprises when you start your job hunt.It's sage advice for any jobseeker, career-changers or otherwise.\"You need to do some research to find out what the career prospects are like in the new field,\" she said.\"Visit sites like deewr.gov.au to get the latest information on industry trends and skills shortages.\"Alternatively you can talk to recruitment agencies that specialise in the area to get the latest industry information.\"She said there were usually other options outside of a career change that could provide the same personal satisfaction.\"Think about the possibility of pursuing your passion outside of work as a hobby,\" Ms McCarthy said.\"For example, you may be interested in a career in the share market. This may be fulfilled through managing a share portfolio at home.\"A change in career will have impacts outside of work. Ms McCarthy said impacts on the hip pocket and personal life also had to be given due consideration.\"If you are considering a career change you need to weigh up how it will affect your financial circumstances and whether it is the right time to make the transition.\"Find out what the entry level salary will be for the new job field, how long it will take for you to move up the ladder and whether this is a worthwhile option.\"Take into account how the career change will impact on your personal life.\"More StoriesPositive signs for employment outlookPerfect time to find your perfect jobClimb above the employment packCentral Queensland jobs explosionYour attitude sets the career altitudeThere are job opportunities still up for grabsEmployers want more from workersShow MoreMore StoriesPositive signs for employment outlookPerfect time to find your perfect jobClimb above the employment packCentral Queensland jobs explosionYour attitude sets the career altitudeThere are job opportunities still up for grabsEmployers want more from workersShow More0employmentRead MoreLogin to followjobsRead MoreLogin to followjobseeker adviceRead MoreLogin to followemployment jobs jobseeker adviceSubscriber ExclusivesPremium Content Demand, price growth proves sun is shining on regionsProperty Beachside suburbs in regional Qld have experienced a surge in buyer demand, with triple digit growth in two unlikely towns.Premium Content How controversial quarantine camps would workHealth A drastic proposal to house international arrivals in Queensland “mining camps” is understood to have stumped the Morrison Government.4Premium Content Ex’s knife assault on mother as she shielded sonCrime A man has been jailed for 10 years after he tried to stab his ex to death while she shielded their son from his vicious attack.Premium Content SA changes border rules with QueenslandHealth South Australia will allow all Queenslanders to enter without having to quarantine from this weekend.Premium Content REPLAYS: All the action of the Basketball Qld State ChampsBasketball REPLAYS: Teams will look to seal semi-finals spots as the final pool games of the Basketball Queensland Under-18 State Championships are played.Premium Content Sophie Monk confirms engagement on InstagramCelebrity Third time could be the charm for Sophie Monk who announced her engagement on Instagram today with a photo showing off her giant diamond ring.Just InBook extract: Fly high with financial freedomBitcoin doubles in price in one monthViewers appalled by graphic Netflix show1X Factor singer slams ‘heartless’ scamsASX flat as Afterpay hits recordNSW man wins lotto twiceJust InLarge hail and storms sweep parts of NSWPremium Content Doomsday prepper ram raids sex shop, steals dildoPremium Content Offender too drunk to recall ‘horrific’ sex attack in toiletDriver to walk after ‘orgy of offending’Top StoriesPremium Content Rescue helicopter en route to horrific Burnett crash sceneBreaking One patient is critically injured and another two are in serious conditions following a horrific two-vehicle crash near Cushnie.HAVE YOU SEEN ROBERT?
