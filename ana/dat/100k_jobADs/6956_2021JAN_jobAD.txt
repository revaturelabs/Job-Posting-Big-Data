She knows she’ll be fired, the Times says today, after the Trump resort issued a statement saying that’s exactly what will happen.“The truth is I’m sad, I feel bad,” she said. “Many people are pointing their finger at me. But I don’t regret what I did.”She’s asked for asylum. She has a hearing in 10 days although her attorney says he’ll ask it be postponed.“Experts, psychologists will be required for the case. She is now a public figure in the United States. That puts her more at risk of returning to Guatemala than before,” he said.In the meantime, she has another job cleaning offices at night.Immigration‹ Older On the challenge of assessing a politician’s 94 yearsNewer › MPR News photojournalist took one of the world’s 100 best pictures of 2018Browse by category Arts & Culture Politics Education Health Weather Science The jobs we do Economy Sports Regional history Surveys and trivia Crime and Justice War Five by 8 Mary and Bob People doing good You Should Meet… This or That War Theft of the Blog People are jerks You should meet … Bob CollinsAbout the bloggerBob Collinsbcollins@mpr.org • @newscutBob Collins retired from Minnesota Public Radio in 2019 after 12 years of writing NewsCut and pointing out to complainants that posts weren’t news stories.
