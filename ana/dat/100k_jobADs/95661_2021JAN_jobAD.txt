Accessibility measures how many destinations, such as jobs, can be reached in a given time.“This project updates our detailed evaluation of access to jobs by transit,” said Andrew Owen, director of the Observatory. “Transit is an essential transportation service for many Americans, and we directly compare the accessibility performance of America’s largest metropolitan areas.”RELATED: U. of Minn. study finds transit doesn't improve healthThe findings have a range of uses and implications. State departments of transportation, metropolitan planning organizations, and transit agencies can apply the evaluations to performance goals related to congestion, reliability, and sustainability. In addition, detailed accessibility evaluation can help in selecting between project alternatives and prioritizing investments.Top 10 metro areas: job accessibility by transit (January 2015)New YorkSan FranciscoChicagoWashingtonLos AngelesBostonPhiladelphiaSeattleSan JoseDenverThe report — “Access Across America: Transit 2015” — presents detailed accessibility values for each of the 49 metropolitan areas, as well as detailed block-level color maps that illustrate the spatial patterns of accessibility within each area. New analysis of the data from the accessibility to jobs by transit rankings will continue to be published periodically.RELATED: Mass transit, training crucial to connecting unemployed with jobsThe accessibility metrics presented in this report are designed to be comparable to those presented in the Accessibility Observatory’s earlier Access Across America: Auto 2015 report. “Taken together, these reports provide a comprehensive view of the relative accessibility impact of auto and transit systems across different cities,” Owen said.For example, the Phoenix and Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan areas have effectively the same total number of jobs (1.7 million; ranked 13th and 14th respectively), and their auto accessibility rankings are also very close — 13th and 12th. “However, they differ significantly in their transit accessibility rankings: Minneapolis–St. Paul ranks 12th in transit access to jobs, while Phoenix ranks 22nd,” Owen said.In the study, rankings are determined by a weighted average of accessibility, giving a higher weight to closer, easier-to-access jobs. Jobs reachable within 10 minutes are weighted most heavily; jobs were given decreasing weight as travel time increases up to 60 minutes. Travel times were calculated using detailed pedestrian networks and full transit schedules for the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. period. The calculations include all components of a transit journey, including “last mile” access and egress walking segments and transfers, and account for minute-by-minute variations in service frequency.RELATED: How transportation spending can transform communitiesFuture comparison reports will track the way that accessibility in these metropolitan areas evolves in response to transportation investments and land-use decisions, Owen explained.The research was sponsored by the National Accessibility Evaluation Pooled-Fund Study, a multi-year effort led by the Minnesota Department of Transportation and supported by partners including the Federal Highway Administration and 10 state DOTs.Read more about study university transit0 CommentsCommentPlease enter a comment.NamePlease enter your name.Email AddressPlease enter a valid email address.PostPlease validate that you are human.See all commentsNewsletterWe respect your data and privacy.By clicking the submit button below, you are agreeing with Bobit Business Media’s Privacy Policy and this outlined level of consent.EmailSubmitView the latest:Metro ExpressMetro WhitepapersMetro Rail eNewsSafety CornerMore From The World's Largest Fleet Media CompanyServing Car & Truck Fleet Management ProfessionalsServing Small Fleet Owners & ManagersServing Corporate, Executive, & Financial Managers Of Large Commercial FleetsServing Leaders In Fleet Mobility & Emerging TechnologyServing Public Sector Fleet ProfessionalsServing Medium & Heavy Duty Commercial Truck ProfessionalsServing Transit Bus, Private Motorcoach, & Passenger Rail ProfessionalsServing School & Pupil Transportation Fleet ProfessionalsServing Vocational & Service Fleet ProfessionalsDon't miss another storyWe respect your data and privacy.By clicking the submit button below, you are agreeing with Bobit Business Media’s Privacy Policy and this outlined level of consent.EmailSubmitSearchMenuTopicsNew MobilityBusParatransitManagementMotorcoachRailTechnologySecurity and SafetyZero EmissionsQuick LinksNewsBlogsPhoto GalleriesVideosJobsDirectoryPodcastsMagazineWebinarsWhitepapersServicesSubscriptionAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsPrivacy PolicyConnect© 2021 Metro Magazine, Bobit Business Media.
