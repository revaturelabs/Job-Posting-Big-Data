It will also be home to a brand new live works training restaurant and alfresco café, adding vibrancy to local communities while delivering industry-standard training and fostering industry partnerships. The new centre will ensure students are jobready and equipped to take up local employment opportunities in the hospitality and tourism industry, as well as in the wider region such as catering in mine sites.A further $6 million for the Kununurra campus has been allocated for a health and hospitality trade training centre. The new training facility will provide simulated in home care training facilities to support National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) related training, and enable North Regional TAFE to deliver NDIS and aged care training.These upgrades to North Regional TAFE are part of a $167.4 million investment in capital works projects, announced by the Premier earlier this week. As part of the State Government's commitment to regional WA, almost half of the total spend — more than $79.1 million — has been allocated to projects at regional TAFE colleges. North Regional TAFE's Pundulmurra campus (South Hedland) and Minurmarghali Mia campus (Roebourne) are also set to receive new facilities through the initiative. As well as improving learning opportunities for students, these projects will also boost the WA economy by generating jobs in the region.The Rebuilding our TAFEs plan includes:$167.4 million in capital works projects across WA$25 million for free TAFE short courses to upskill thousands of Western Australians$32 million for the expansion of the Lower fees, local skills program$4.8 million for the Apprenticeship and Traineeship Re-engagement IncentiveThe new state-of-the-art training facilities will meet demand for more skilled workers in the region by expanding free training options and increasing the number of half price courses available, as part of the State Government's Lower fees, local skills initiative. Initially launched in January, the initiative halved the cost of training for 34 high priority qualifications. In July, the program was expanded to include an additional 39 courses slashed by up to 72 per cent to align with the State's immediate economic needs following COVID-19.The courses with reduced fees are also targeted at job opportunities that relate to capital works initiatives such as the Rebuilding our TAFEs plan.For information about free training and half price qualifications, visit the Skills Ready page at jobsandskills.wa.gov.au/skillsready\"Improving TAFE facilities is a key component of the WA Recovery Plan.
