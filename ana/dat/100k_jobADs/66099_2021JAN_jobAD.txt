These FREE virtual meetings are designed for middle school educators as a confidential place of collegial sharing and insight in a safe and supportive setting. Come with your challenges, dilemmas, or new ideas. For many of us, our middle school is the only middle school in the community. There is little opportunity to share our concerns and ideas. Our job-a-like meetings now provide that chance.With virtual classrooms, remote learning, hybrid models now a part of our everyday lexicon, this is an opportunity to hear and share practical solutions, learn innovative practices, and even conclude…I am doing a pretty darn good job in my classroom and in my school.Talking points include, but are not limited, to:What is working in our school as well as what are some of the struggles regarding remote learning?What is the best way to assess student learning?How do we address concerns regarding student non-participation?​Do you work in another department/content area? The New England League of Middle Schools would like to add more of these sessions. Just email nelms@nelms.org with your department/content so we can track interest and keep you notified.​26TueJanJob-Alike Virtual Meeting - Performing Arts/Online EventRSVP28ThuJanJob-Alike Virtual Meeting - Mathematics/Online EventRSVP04ThuFebJob-Alike Virtual Meeting - ELA/English Language Arts/Online EventRSVP09TueFebJob-Alike Virtual Meeting - School Resource Officer/Online EventRSVP11ThuFebJob-Alike Virtual Meeting - Social Studies/Online EventRSVP02TueMarJob-Alike Virtual Meeting - Paraprofessional/Ed Tech/Teacher Aide/Online EventRSVP04ThuMarJob-Alike Virtual Meeting - Science/Online EventRSVPNew England League of Middle SchoolsPO Box 887Georgetown, MA 01833Phone:(877) 402-7627nelms@nelms.org© 2023 by HARMONY.
