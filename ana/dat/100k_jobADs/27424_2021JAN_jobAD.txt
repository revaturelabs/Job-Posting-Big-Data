Right now we're about 1-2 months from seeing the headsets start to arrive in customers' hands.Sadly I think Year 1 will be more about interesting experiences and demos than full VR games but we'll learn a lot about what the hardware and software can and cannot do.Interested in testing your PC for VR-ability? Steam has an app for that. http://store.steampowered.com/app/32... It's built for Steam VR but has similar requirements for the other major headsets.Some VR Resources:ReviewsDetailed product review of the Oculus RiftUploadVRThe Rift ArcadeThe Reddit home for general VRVive and Rift comparedInfo on more Vive launch titlesOculus Launch Lineup Trailer:- Buy and play more Indie games!polypusherPosted: May 21, 2016 4:34 AMPermalinkPixel PimpSeattle!I think BigScreen has implications for virtually commuting for work. Probably not in its current form or even with our current hardware but the ability to visit a co-worker's 'office' and share a screen and have gestures and stuff changes the idea of remote work quite a bit.- Buy and play more Indie games!Warriorpoet897Posted: May 21, 2016 4:35 AMPermalinkRhyme and PunishmentNew Jerseylancejt wrote:BigScreen might be my killer app. I can't wait to see where they go with this and hopefully they'll add the ability to get the audio from the other peoples machines at some point.There's just something about hanging out with friends across the country in VR that works for me.And it's all for the low low price of free...http://store.steampowered.com/app/45...Awesome I hadn't heard of this.

That's the killer app at this point as far as I'm concerned. Can't wait for the full game.I've played a lot of Fantastic Contraption as well as The Gallery, the archery game in the Lab and some Elite Dangerous. I hear Hover Junkers and Audioshield are awesome but I haven't tried them yet.Also check out Portal Stories VR. Fun portal game with voice acting and everything made by community members. Really well done.PSN / Steam / Wii U: Warriorpoet897Switch: SW-6350-0100-9262Now Playing: Octopath Traveler, The Last Guardian, Fallout 4 VR, Legend of Zelda, Vagrant Story, Bard’s Tale 3.NothingWittyPosted: May 22, 2016 6:57 PMPermalinkConsultantSwitzerlandHolopoint is fun, but might be too close to Space Pirate Trainer.I've also been using the BigScreen Beta to play some of the original Portal two on a big screen in VR.I've bought theBlu - it's pretty, but not interactive, and relatively short.OrphuPosted: May 22, 2016 7:53 PMPermalinkCould be fourth declension neuter...IoNothingWitty wrote:I've bought theBlu - it's pretty, but not interactive, and relatively short.Well, you can play with the fish, jelly fish, and anemones.Elite: Spaceman SpiffOnikazePosted: May 23, 2016 2:31 AMPermalinkInternWarriorpoet897 wrote:Interesting. Thanks for the write up.Funny story... I just tried to grab the Oculus software so I could hack some of their games onto the Vive, and it won't even let me install their app because my CPU is not supported (SSE 4.2 or something?). I think it's amuisng that I can run most Vive applications fine but Oculus won't even let me into their store because of my CPU.It might be time for an upgrade, though. My CPU is like five years old.Also, I tried playing Elite Dangerous. I found the text on screen to be so aliased that I couldn't read it a lot of the time. Apparently this is a Vive issue that is better on Oculus at the moment. Just throwing that out there.not sure what is going on as my computer doesn't meet the official specs and all I get is a msg that I see if I look above the section of tiles in home.other that that it's been fine.MinasePosted: May 23, 2016 4:39 PMPermalink7.62mm HeadacheSeattle, WASo what are peoples favorites other than vanishign realms so far? I have my Vive but only for 3-4 days. I keep finding myself going back to space pirate trainer but I am liking most of what I try.Other than the Lab, in my house Tilt Brush dominates (this is great for kids!). I have been doing a lot of Zen Blade, it's a good workout but starting to get frustrated with a few of the bugs. If you want to try some virtual tourism, I recommend Realities, the interface is really well done and it's a neat way to 'see' places. I also like SketchFab VR for checking out cool stuff, some of the models people are putting up in there are really well done.I never minded piracy. Anyone who minds about piracy is full of sh*t.

It's a little rough but very pretty and a really interesting game. Slightly terrifying if you have an unwarranted fear of deep dark water like I do, but still worth a visitSubnautica doesnt say if it supports the Vive or not but I think anything on Steam that supports the Rift will at least be playable on the Vive, it just might not know what to do with the hand controllers.- Buy and play more Indie games!SpyNavyPosted: May 25, 2016 12:23 PMPermalinkMan Overboard!Fear the Psyker!STeam lets you sort for Vive support.

Even having been playing with the Vive since Thursday, having sustained experiences with zero stutter and a super high frame rate is still mind blowing.

They had Reggie Watts perform a live-ish show in VR. Audience members were split into rooms (each about the size of, and dressed as, a small comedy club) of about 30 and the emcee and performers were sort of rebroadcast into each room. It was an interesting concept but the execution fell flat on its face with technical difficulties and performance problems.The opening act was a really bad comic. He tried some audience participation stuff but no one realized what a bad idea that would be when you're mirrored to a dozen rooms, you're often minutes out of sync with some rooms and you're cutting out constantly. Room A doesn't see or hear the audience in room B he's interacting with. He told some completely flat jokes about a hypothetical gay son, pooping, and did sound effects. Really bad, and his client crashed leaving us in the audience with nothing to do but talk about how bad he was. Our own chat audio, by the way, was flawless, so much fun was made.While the comic was mercifully crashed someone realized the live stream on YouTube was way ahead and already showing Reggie Watts performing. I think most people abandoned the VR show for YouTube at this point. Watts was represented by a bad avatar, there were no stage effects that I saw and so the novelty wore off so fast that I didn't stay for more.It was never meant to feel like a real thing, like being at a real performance. The cheesy avatars and lack of stage presence really prevent that, so even if you count out the technical problems I'm not sure it would have been an impressive experience. It was novel, experimental. I'd say the real technical problems are on the bandwidth side for Altspace themselves. They can give it another shot and hopefully do better, but it needs a lot of work..Altspace is a free social VR thing on Steam. You can play D&D, watch YouTube, play disc golf etc with other folks.- Buy and play more Indie games!Warriorpoet897Posted: June 2, 2016 3:23 AMPermalinkRhyme and PunishmentNew JerseySo, Holopoint is AWESOME. You feel like Legolas got stuck in a Matrix training program. Super bad ass. Plus it is a workout. I'm in decent shape and after one round I was sweating. Just watch your cable management--you'll be spinning around a lot.Also if you're into pool, The new game out today on Steam is great. Just about perfect physics, cool environment, and a great solution to replace having a table to lean on.PSN / Steam / Wii U: Warriorpoet897Switch: SW-6350-0100-9262Now Playing: Octopath Traveler, The Last Guardian, Fallout 4 VR, Legend of Zelda, Vagrant Story, Bard’s Tale 3.PropagandalfPosted: June 2, 2016 1:14 PMPermalinkThe RedMy Vive should be arriving tomorrow.

Both of these are 2 that I still play nearly every time I play VR.Space Pirate Simulator and HolopointMusic based rhythmAudio Shield - Play whatever music you want while you can casually colored orbs coming at you or actively punch them. Standing game.ScienceUniverse Sandbox - This really depends on the person but as someone that is interested in astronomy this thing is amazing. Look around at different things like you are in the middle of a planetarium or create a solar system of your own. You can even blow it up if you like.

Just download the bits from GitHub, install Oculus home and bam, your Oculus games are completely integrated in the Steam VR interface.I suggest Chronos off the Oculus store. Dark Souls lite in VR with some novel character leveling mechanics and a post apocalyptic twist.You also get luckey's tale for free when you install the Oculus Store.For the Vive, I suggest Vanishing Realms and The Gallery Episode 1: Call of the Star Seed.Warriorpoet897Posted: June 2, 2016 4:25 PMPermalinkRhyme and PunishmentNew JerseyYeah Revive works flawlessly as of right now.Must play games:Budget Cuts Demo (my favorite)Vanishing RealmsThe GallerySpace Pirate Trainer (addictive)Fantastic ContraptionThe LabHolopointIf you want just an awesome short visually impressive intro, try the Blu.
