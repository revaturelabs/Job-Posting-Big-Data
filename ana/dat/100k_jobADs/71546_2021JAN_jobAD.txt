That’s not bad. The headline unemployment rate ticked down to 5.9 percent, due to a combination of more employment and more people dropping out of the labor force. However, the labor force participation rate stayed about the same as last month, so this jobs report isn’t primarily about people giving up on looking for work. It’s basically good news.Overall, this is a much better report than last month’s, and to add to the good news, the BLS revised upward the July and August reports by a combined total of 69,000 jobs. The economy still isn’t booming, but the past six months are starting to look pretty solid. More people are working and hiring rates are up. Hopefully this will produce some wage gains too in the near future.Looking for news you can trust?Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.CloseThank you for subscribing!EmailBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use, and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.SIX TRUTHSReclaiming power from those who abuse it often starts with telling the truth.
