If he gets neither of those jobs he comes back.JMF2006January 12I am voting he stays as OC.....you can always hopeT masterJanuary 12Definitely the Chargers given the weather and the QB along with all the young players they have out there that would be his best bet for sure .LABILLBACKER 3,902Posted January 12LABILLBACKERAll ProMembers3,9027,938 postsSharePosted January 12Chargers would be foolish not to hire him. Herbert has similar qualities as Josh. But knowing the LA market they may go after a bigger name.QuoteLink to postShare on other sitesMJS 8,102Posted January 12MJSAll ProMembers8,1029,976 postsLocation:North Salt Lake, UTSharePosted January 12What I haven't heard talked about much is if Daboll leaves he is going to try to take some of his staff with him. So maybe Dorsey follows him and becomes HIS offensive coordinator.QuoteLink to postShare on other sitesHebert19 2,047Posted January 12Hebert19VeteranMembers2,0471,985 postsSharePosted January 12I think if he does not get chargers job he stays. Thats the best fit.QuoteLink to postShare on other sitesNihilarian 1,251Posted January 12NihilarianWorking man!Members1,2515,134 postsSharePosted January 122 hours ago, jwhit34 said:Interested to know what everyone thinks, right now I am picking none.

But, yes, they have known each other a long time.QuoteLink to postShare on other sitesGunnerBill 17,575Posted January 12GunnerBillHall of FamerMembers17,57532,080 postsSharePosted January 122 hours ago, jwhit34 said:Interested to know what everyone thinks, right now I am picking none.

I had a go yesterday in my Black Monday thread but the big development since then is Arthur Smith HAS interviewed with the Falcons. I think he is overwhelming favourite to get that job.

A lot of people are making it about other things, but the bottom line is he has the best Quarterback in the league, works under the second best coach in the league and has never called a game in the NFL.Neither had Doug Pederson in KC.QuoteLink to postShare on other sitesMcBean 1,499Posted January 12McBeanVeteranMembers1,4991,887 postsSharePosted January 123 hours ago, jwhit34 said:Interested to know what everyone thinks, right now I am picking none.

It was reported days ago that Detroit was impressed with Marvin Lewis and Bieniemy wanted nothing to do with Houston. Today it was reported that Saleh is the front runner for the NYJ.Looks like this one is waaaay off so far. The Bieniemy take especially throws me for a loop here.QuoteLink to postShare on other sitesDirehard Fan 58Posted January 12Direhard FanRFAMembers58955 postsLocation:Stephentown NYSharePosted January 12He stays. Strong ties to Rochester. Move family to LA?? I don't believe he would do that. Pay him more money and make him Asst. Head coach and he stays.QuoteLink to postShare on other sitesRc2catch 3,588Posted January 12Rc2catchVeteranMembers3,5883,888 postsSharePosted January 12It’s all on what article you read.ESPN mentioned the Jets have Daboll as their #1 candidate and Saleh as 2. Of course Pederson wasn’t mentioned but he’s still fresh to the rumor pool.I think Daboll would be kinda worthless for LA. The offense is already legit. Whatever they did this year kinda worked, not sure I want Daboll coming with his difficult playbook to possibly complicate what they’ve already established. Their defense however has talent but was horrendous.Im giving Saleh whatever he wants to come to LA and fix that defense. He can probably keep the offensive coordinator LA had this year.QuoteLink to postShare on other sitesFan in San Diego 104Posted January 12Fan in San DiegoOld Sage from way back when.Members1049,495 postsLocation:San Diego, Ca.,SharePosted January 12I hope he stays , but I would assume the Chargers job looks the best on paper.
