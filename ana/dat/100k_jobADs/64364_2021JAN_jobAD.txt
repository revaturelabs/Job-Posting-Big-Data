Pediatric nurses have to be patient. They have to be understanding, yet able to communicate effectively and honestly with a child and their family about their illness and treatment. And every Children's nurse must have the confidence to take a patient's care into his or her own hands. At Children's you'll work closely with each patient and their family across a continuum of care - beginning with admission, when you perform physical assessments and take a patient/family history that covers all the vitals. You'll prepare and carry out a plan of patient care. You'll work with professionals from all Children's health care disciplines. Together you will ensure your patients' progress every step of the way. You will even make rounds with physicians, discussing your patients' conditions and needs. Professionally, you'll grow like never before. The nursing practice environment at Children's is ideal for developing your skills to the maximum, increasing your level of responsibility and entering new specialty areas. Our versatile career ladder, the Program for Professional Advancement (PPA), enables you to move both vertically and laterally across a wide range of clinical, educational and management opportunities. Recently we restructured our nurses compensation package to include: * Flexible Scheduling * Tuition Assistance * Professional Development * Clinical Ladder * Continuing Education Conferences (local, regional, national) * Weekend Incentive Program * Exceptional Differentials * Preceptorship and Charge Nurse Recognition * Certification and Degree Recognition Bonus * Collaborate with Internationally-Acclaimed * Medical Leaders * Pediatric Nursing Fellowships (PICU, NICU, Hematology/Oncology) * AND MORE! Our recent achievement of *Magnet* status reflects what we've known all along: That our nurses are something very special - that their vision, talents, dedication and leadership define a truly exceptional practice environment. We invite you to learn more about our Magnet environment, accomplished by approximately 6% of the nation's hospitals, and even fewer pediatric centers. We are also a *Beacon Award winner*, recognized for our outstanding CICU and PICU environments. In fact, our Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit is the first in the country to be designated a Beacon Award winner AND our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit is the first in the Northeast region to receive the Beacon designation!Not ready to apply?Email me to apply laterSimilar jobsPatient Care Technician - Pediatric ICU (CNA Certified, Any State)Washington, District of Columbia-WashingtonChildren’s National HospitalSave Patient Care Technician - Pediatric ICU (CNA Certified, Any State)You need to sign in or create an account to saveNewSanitation AssociateWashington, District of Columbia-WashingtonChildren’s National HospitalSave Sanitation AssociateYou need to sign in or create an account to saveNewCashier Food ServiceWashington, District of Columbia-WashingtonChildren’s National HospitalSave Cashier Food ServiceYou need to sign in or create an account to saveNewMore searches like thisNurse Healthcare jobs in Washington D.C.SendSaveYou need to sign in or create an account to saveBack to topNavigationAbout usContact usTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My InfoHelpFraudTerms of SaleTop Workplaces2020 Star Nurses FinalistsTwitter feedsPost a job with usSearch employersPopular SearchesJobs in Alexandria, VirginiaJobs in Arlington, VirginiaJobs in Springfield, VirginiaJobs in Fairfax, VirginiaJobs in Reston, VirginiaMore...ConnectFacebookTwitterLinkedInInstagram© 2014 - 2021 The Washington Post.
