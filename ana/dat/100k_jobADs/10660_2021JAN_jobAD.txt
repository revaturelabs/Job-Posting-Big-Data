Any mods I should have being a hunter? I'm rockin' Bartender, Quartz, Decursive, Combuctor (I LOVE this mod), Auctioneer, and BigWigs as my main stuff. Also some smaller convenience ones like hit assist and cartographer. Although, I'm tempted to re-up Questhelper as we're leveling again but its kind of heavy and the new map and quest system in game seem pretty solid. Also, any hints towards what pets i should tame and talents specs would be nice.Sidebar: Its kind of weird being lvl 5 and having 200g and all Netherweave bags.\"A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool.”-William ShakespeareAs Gandhi said, \"an eye for an eye leaves the whole world without Nazis.\"-Chairman_MaoPopEscPosted: April 8, 2010 4:44 PMPermalinkConsultantCary, NCI'm going to change my character. I will now be playing a Dwarven warrior, HarmerTime. We don't need two rogues.ELewis17Posted: April 8, 2010 4:53 PMPermalinkOMGWTFBBQPWNDLave, bitchesI have a nice Hunter mod. I'll get the name when I get home. It reminds you to swap Aspects when your mana is low or too high to warrant a certain aspect.The pets have been severely simplified since the last hunter I played before 3.x.x. Given that we have a warrior in the group now, and assuming he'll function as the off-tank, you should go for a DPS pet over a balanced or tank type pet. I forget the three names, Tanacity is the balanced one I think.WoW|Steam MMOs: Lockjaw XBL: Lockjaw GWJzeroKFEPosted: April 8, 2010 4:55 PMPermalinkCitrus CasanovaJust hanging around somewhere...Any mods I should have being a hunter?I know you didn't actually ask me, but since hunter is my class of choice I'll go ahead and butt in.These days there really isn't anything hunter specific that you'll want, especially at early level. Once upon a time you might have wanted something to help with feed pet and tracking pet happiness, and maybe you still will if you can't get the mend pet minor glyph right at level 10 (which is when you will get your pet). Now, though, get that glyph and heal him from time to time and you should be golden.I know some people like to have custom mods for managing aspects, tracking types, or traps, but I do all that with Bartender and macros. The only mods that I find essential to good high level hunter play are general things -- a button bar mod, a unit frame mod, a cast bar mod, something to help you keep better track of your cooldowns and buffs (I use PowerAuras and SexyCooldowns myself), DBM or Bigwigs, and (of course) a performance analysis tool like recount. Again, though, that's all stuff I'm sure you have installed from playing your other high level characters.No, what you really need that's hunter specific are macros and keybinds. Get a pet management macro for sure, a macro for toggling aspects, and (much later when you learn the skill) a misdirect macro. Also, be aware of what shots and abilities can be macro'd in with your common shots and which cooldown can be combined in macros, but that is all going to change depending on what spec you go with and what abilities you have available at any given level. As for keybinds, there is a lot that is up to personal preference but one thing I personally think is mandatory as a hunter is to have keybinds for send and recall pet that are right next you your own movement keys. I use WASD for my own movement, and Z and X are my pet movement. This will let you always be in control of where your pet is, and let you avoid having people be angry at you for you pet being in the wrong place.zeroKFE on: XBL | Steam | InstagramzeroKFEPosted: April 8, 2010 5:09 PMPermalinkCitrus CasanovaJust hanging around somewhere...I have a nice Hunter mod. I'll get the name when I get home. It reminds you to swap Aspects when your mana is low or too high to warrant a certain aspectThis is actually an excellent point. Knowing what aspect you currently have active and knowing when you should change it is central to good hunter play. Personally, I use PowerAuras to track this information along with other buff and cooldown information. Have I mentioned how goddamn awesome PowerAuras is?Also, any hints towards what pets i should tame and talents specs would be nice.The definitive resource for everything pet related: http://www.wow-petopia.com/The three types of pets:Ferocity: DPS focused pets. They have talents that make them the only type you want for group play, unless you REALLY need your pet to be a strong off tank. They are also fine for soloing, even though tenacity pet are better. If you only have one pet, it should be a ferocity pet. In the endgame, wolfs are currently king as their special ability is an AP buff for themselves and the hunter. At lower levels just tame whatever you like (or whatever has a special ability you like), as you really don't need to worry about min maxing so much.Tenacity: Tank pets. They have talents that make them tough and can hold aggro on multiple mobs once you get the thunderstomp talent (I don't think you'll have the pet talent points for that until level 30 or 40 or so). If you have two pets, one should be ferocity and the other should be tenacity, and if I was leveling a new hunter, I'd have at least two pets. Bears and crocolisks make ideal tenacity pets since their special abilities will also provide AOE threat, but other than that once again pick what appeals to you or has an ability that sounds cool.Cunning: PvP/special utility pets. Their talent tree is designed to let them provide niche functionality. Unless you plan to PvP as you level, you'll probably want to stick to the other two types of pets, but if you do take a liking to a particular cunning pet you'll probably still be just fine for leveling.zeroKFE on: XBL | Steam | InstagramAriesPosted: April 8, 2010 5:26 PMPermalinkPopulation: TireSanctuaryOh, a friendly tip for a hunter in a group setting - release / unsummon your pet before you jump down that awesome shortcut in [insert instance here], your pet will go down the long way, pulling every mob on the way to you and your groupTorq - I can certainly see myself whipping it out for a quick solo on commutes though.SteamAries#1590Cheeto1016Posted: April 8, 2010 5:53 PMPermalinkBarely Adequate Ginger QueenColumbus, OhioWell it looks like Zero is all over that I am not a big add-on person. I do use them... just as little as possible. I have Healbot up on all my toons (just cause i never disable it from non healing toons) and recount and DBM and mandatory mods.. but I like simple. I just make lots of macros.I guess I am old school due to playing back then.I was going to suggest Petopoia, but Zero already did that. I also like to use weird pets that most people do not use. So I used Clackle (my crab) most of leveling up...cause until about level 50, he could do more damage then my ferocity pet cause thunderstomp was AOE and crit all the time. I switched then to a moth, just cause I thought it would really be annoying having a moth attack you or follow you in PvP. I do not play my hunter in raids though, so it is a fun and mess around toon.SteamLoL: Cheeto1016FF14: Cheeto GwjGrennPosted: April 8, 2010 5:57 PMPermalinkAwesomeville CrierSitting uncomfortably close to your girlfriendAwesome advice.

I know I have a bowling banquet coming up and it is on a monday. I believe April 26th? Things come up, you never know.Over 5 we can always PvP for a change of pace (pvp gives xp now) or rotate people. I have absolutly no problem sitting out. I can still keep up in leveling. Which brings me to....I made my toon last night. Openminded is the name, I hit level 14. Just a few more quests and I will be at the 15 mark for Monday. I hope to be able to do that Sat. evening or Sunday evening.

That way if someone has to wave off for the week, we're covered. Some weeks we just get together and do some leveling if more than that have to wave off. Sometimes we have lulls, but we've been going strong for quite a while now. :D'Life' happens to so many people that I imagine that every week at least one of the six people will have something else they need to do one our scheduled day. It'd be awesome if we could get another few people and run another group on a different night. That way we could all kinda float around, but I'm sure scheduling that would be a nightmare.WoW|Steam MMOs: Lockjaw XBL: Lockjaw GWJPages123456789…next ›last »You are hereHome » Forums » MMORPG Junction"
