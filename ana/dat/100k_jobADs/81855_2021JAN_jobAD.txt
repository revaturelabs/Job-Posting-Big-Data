We are looking for talented, enthusiastic and highly accomplished PhD or MD/PhD graduates with interest in tissue engineering research and strong ability forcollaboration and team work.The position is for tissue engineering of the lung, towards providing more human lungs for transplant and developing whole-lung models of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (projects funded by NHLBI and NIBIB). Background and experience in one or more of the following areas is required: pulmonology, surgery, large animal studies, tissue engineering, whole organ bioreactors, stem cell biology, and immunology.Application DetailsApply Here: http://pa334.peopleadmin.com/postings/6671When inquiring or applying for this job opening, please also reference AcademicCareers.comApplicants with dual-career considerations can find university jobs such as professor jobs, dean jobs, chair / department head jobs, and other faculty jobs and employment opportunities at Columbia University and at other institutions of higher education in the region on www.AcademicCareers.comEmail me jobs like thisAbout Columbia University, Biomedical Engineering DepartmentAboutBiomedical engineering is an evolving discipline in engineering that draws on collaboration among engineers, physicians, and scientists to provide interdisciplinary insight into medical and biological problems. The field has developed its own knowledge base and principles that are the foundation for the academic programs designed by the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University.CoursesCourses offered by the Department of Biomedical Engineering are complemented by courses offered by other departments in The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science and by many departments in the Faculty of Medicine, the College of Dental Medicine, and the Mailman School of Public Health, as well as the science departments within the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.Learn MoreResearch AreasAreas of particular interest to Columbia faculty include biomechanics, cellular and tissue engineering and artificial organs, auditory biophysics, and biosignals and biomedical imaging.Learn MoreThe programs in biomedical engineering at Columbia (BS, MS, PhD, EngScD, and MD/PhD) prepare students to apply engineering and applied science to problems in biology, medicine, and the understanding of living systems and their behavior, and to develop biomedical systems and devices. Modern engineering encompasses sophisticated approaches to measurement, data acquisition and analysis, simulation, and systems identification. These approaches are useful in the study of individual cells, organs, entire organisms, and populations of organisms. The increasing value of mathematical models in the analysis of living systems is an important sign of the success of contemporary activity. Programs in biomedical engineering are taught by our own faculty, members of other Engineering departments, and faculty from other university divisions who have strong interests and involvement in biomedical engineering. Several of the faculty hold joint appointments in Biomedical Engineering and other University departments.Company ProfileApply NowShare this job:HomeContactFAQAbout UsTerms & ConditionsEmployerPost a JobAd AgenciesSign inJob SeekerFind JobsCreate ResumeSign inFacebookTwitterInstagramLinkedInAcademic Careers Â© 1999-2021 All Rights Reserved."
