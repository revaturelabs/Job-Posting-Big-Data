I have learned a lot about, traveled to and lived in many places around the world and learn to speak their languages. Iâ€™d like to share this knowledge with you here, through my own writings, the writings of others, and other tidbits of interest. Posts and podcasts will cover politics, music, life and more, and will be informative, fun, funny and thought provoking.Subscribe ToPostsAtomPostsCommentsAtomCommentsBlog ArchiveBlog Archive July 2005 (10) August 2005 (5) October 2005 (1) November 2005 (3) December 2005 (2) May 2006 (8) June 2006 (4) July 2006 (9) August 2006 (8) October 2006 (1) November 2006 (1) December 2006 (2) May 2008 (1) May 2009 (2) June 2009 (3) July 2009 (3) September 2009 (1)What do you think of the president's health care plan?"
