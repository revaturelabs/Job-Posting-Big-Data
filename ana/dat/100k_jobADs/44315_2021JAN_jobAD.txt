The unemployment rate fell one percent over the same period.“Connecticut finishes 2014 on an encouraging note with more than 80 percent of nonfarm jobs recovered from the Great Recession — almost 94 percent for the private sector,” Andy Condon, director of the Office of Research for the state Labor Department, said in a statement. “Employment gains were widespread across most industries and regions, although wages are slower to recover. We look forward to the annual benchmark revision in March to see if this level of growth holds up when more complete data becomes available.”Connecticut’s private sector added 3,900 jobs in December. The leisure and hospitality employment sector added 2,100 jobs last month, the largest growth of any of the industry groupings that are tracked.The state’s manufacturing sector added 1,200 jobs, according to the labor department.Four of the six labor market areas in the state saw employment gains. The Hartford area added 2,200 jobs in December followed by New Haven, which saw its employment levels increase by 800.Economists around Connecticut greeted the state’s December employment numbers with a mix of optimism and realism.“This is good news and it’s bolstered by the news that manufacturing added 1,200 jobs in the month,” Peter Gioia, vice president and economist for the Connecticut Business & Industry Association, said in a statement. “While Connecticut appears to be doing well right now, there is concern for keeping this momentum through 2016. We have a state budget crisis and other matters before the state legislature that could help or hinder job recovery.”Most PopularNobody shows for ‘MAGA Drag’ from New Haven to HartfordUnforgivable sins?

Connecticut has recovered nearly 81 percent of the jobs it lost during that period, while the U.S. already has restored the employment losses it suffered during the recession.“The December job figures for Connecticut were basically in line with my expectations, but very disappointing given the larger and more important context of 2014 as a whole,” Klepper-Smith said in a statement. “It’s hard to get excited when we see an annual job gain of just 13,600 jobs for the year, when prior stronger expansions have witnessed growth of two and three times that amount”.Call Luther Turmelle at 203-680-9388.Expert OpinionJames Walker ColumnistJames Walker: Still we march toward King’s dreamColumnist James Walker remembers when he was a kid and the name Martin Luther King Jr. was like an electric current running through Black...Susan Campbell ColumnistCampbell: New training will improve home ownership equity in CTConnecticut real estate agents will soon have to take a three-hour class that examines racial bias in their profession.Colin McEnroe ColumnistColin McEnroe: What should the GOP become?Columnist Colin McEnroe mulls why the Connecticut Republican Party held a MAGA yard sale the day after attacks on the U.S. Capitol.Dan Haar Columnist and Associate EditorDan Haar: A sick, aging man awaits vaccine in COVID’s chaos\"If I have to wait five months, I’m done,\" David D’Andrea said, watching Gov.
