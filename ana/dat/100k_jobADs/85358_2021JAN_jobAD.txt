Some things I get to cover I assume are going to be cool but end up being something entirely different. Welcome to today.This morning I set up shop at 9:30 a.m. in the atrium of Howe Hall for a town hall meeting featuring the Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden. I was sent to film the event and the University's President interacting with him. Well the VP's people didn't want every camera man gumming up the works so during the time when Biden and Leath were together there were only 2 cameras allowed to film them, one from the news affiliates, one from the University. I let the College of Engineering guy take the University position. What I didn't realize was my choice doomed me to standing in place for 3 straight hours.From 9:30 to 11:45 nothing happened. People sat and chatted, music played and I stood uncomfortable in a 3 square foot area in the back of the room. Finally, after that 2 hour test of will the Vice President came out with a student representative and Former Iowa Governor, current Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack. What followed was roughly 90 minutes of political conjecture. I was intrigued by the content but my legs were very displeased.Vice President Biden gave a speech, answered some questions and generally came off as an intelligent and likeable guy. He ISU a lot of credit for its research and innovation and said that whatever country figures out Green technology first will win the race and Iowa State is a major boost to the United States chances. Being someone who loves green initiatives and sustainability I dug that.My thighs and feet couldn't have cared less. When I finally collapsed my gear and got out of Howe my legs felt like cuts of meat that had been curing in the sun for two weeks. Sitting here now hours later I still feel like my legs need an oil change. So while I love bragging about the cool stuff I get to do thanks to being a guy with a camera, there are some serious down sides. Now if you excuse I think I'm gonna go stretch for a 45 to 60 minutes.ShareGet linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther AppsLabels: College of Engineering Film Howe Hall Iowa State Joe Biden Vice President VideographyCommentsPost a CommentPopular PostsAugust 17, 2018La Palle DolceShareGet linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther AppsPost a CommentMay 20, 2019Going Public, and by that I mean speakingShareGet linkFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailOther AppsPost a CommentPowered by BloggerP@Visit profileArchive2020 5November 1October 2June 1April 12019 6November 1August 2May 1February 1January 12018 28December 1November 2October 2September 2August 5July 2June 2May 2April 2March 3February 2January 32017 27December 1November 3October 2September 1August 3July 1June 2May 4April 2March 2February 4January 22016 31November 1October 2August 2July 2June 4May 4April 6March 5February 52015 58December 4November 4October 4September 3August 7July 4June 5May 5April 5March 6February 4January 72014 47December 3November 2October 4September 4August 4July 6June 3May 2April 6March 5February 3January 52013 40December 4November 4October 3September 3August 4July 5June 3May 5April 5March 42012 23November 1October 2August 1June 2May 3April 5March 5Professionals Protect their Private PasswordsAttracting Those Who Believe What You BelieveThe Importance for Small Fish to Stay OrganizedCombing Through Athletic HistoryThe Spectre of Job PerksFebruary 3January 12011 14December 2November 6September 1August 1June 1May 1April 1March 1Show more Show lessLabels#DM48HFP2#Music1201913D13D Printers13D TV148 Hour Film Project12a la carte1A Widow's Might1A.J.
