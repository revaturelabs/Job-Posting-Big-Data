Over 11,000 people took part in surveys, and a range of focus and research groups were held. We have linked this research with wider economic and social indicators.Residents’ top concerns were the impact on jobs and family finances, alongside continuing worries about public safety and health.Residents also wanted to make sure that in the longer-term we tackle the inequalities which have been highlighted throughout the pandemic and maintain a focus on the prosperity of the borough.Priority one: connecting people with jobsJobs are our residents’ top priority.Prior to the pandemic, London experienced almost full employment. The help that was given to find jobs was focussed on those very far from the labour market, and on improving residents’ skills so that they could increase their incomes.Now, claims for Jobseeker’s Allowance in the borough are up by 122 per cent since the start of the crisis, and 38,000 residents have been furloughed.The challenge has become the supply of jobs.We will do everything in our power to ensure that employers who work and profit in the area seek to employ our residents. This commitment must start with the council and our partners.We want to make sure all residents can fulfil their potential and find rewarding work. We will support our residents, and work with investors and established local businesses to help create jobs.Our five-point plan1. Creating a local jobs economy Click to get infoWe will strive to ensure jobs for our residents, with a focus on those that have faced disadvantage in the past, and who now face even greater economic challenges.We will hold a summit of major employers to help create as many local jobs as possible. We will support organisations who work in the borough to advertise and hire from our community, and celebrate those who do. Importantly, this must include council contractors and service providers.2. A single front door for jobs Click to get infoOur residents should not have to ask twice for help in finding a job. If there is a suitable job out there, we want to help people find it quickly.This means we will take a lead role helping employers advertise and hire locally. We will ensure our residents can easily find opportunities on a live jobs feed, and every council worker will be able to signpost people to help and support.3. Opportunities for our children and young people Click to get infoThe future is most challenging for our young people. We want to provide opportunities, support and guidance to help them meet their potential, especially those who face inequalities that are deeply embedded in our society.Building on the council’s progress to improve life chances we will form a new coalition with higher education providers, employers, support services to improve our young people’s employment and skills prospects.4. Community support for jobs and skills Click to get infoCommunity efforts can help people into meaningful work and prevent longer term unemployment. We will establish a service for skilled volunteers to help residents with the tools and confidence needed to find work, harnessing local expertise to the benefit of everyone.We will launch an ongoing programme of skills surgeries and expand our ESOL provision. We will support businesses to keep going and help new businesses to open, redoubling our campaign to ask our residents to choose local and support everyone.5. Waltham Forest as London’s green jobs borough Click to get infoOur commitment to tackling the climate emergency is also a commitment to local jobs. We will create a pathway to green jobs, making sure our people have the right skills and entrepreneurial support to benefit from the growth of the green economy.The council will work with community groups to deliver green retrofitting services, benefitting from government funding and taking on trusted provider status. This will help making buildings more energy-efficient, lowering their impact on the climate, and helping to tackle the borough's carbon footprint.Get stuff doneDownload the full Waltham Forest Public Service Strategy (PDF)Download the Public Service Engagement and Research Report (PDF)Related linksIntroduction from the Leader and Chief ExecutiveA Public Service StrategyEngagement and researchHow the Council needs to respondImpacts of COVID-19Priority 2: safe and healthy livesPriority 3: our 15-minute neighbourhoodPriority 4: confidence in our futureAccessibilityPrivacyCookiesDisclaimerContact usSocialmedia Twitter profile buttonSocialmedia Facebook profile buttonSocialmedia Instagram profile buttonSocialmedia YouTube profile button© London Borough of Waltham Forest, 2021."
