You have every bit of entertainment in the palm of your hands…which, unfortunately, can result in work not getting done.Transform your phone into a tool that boosts work efficiency. Install productivity apps! Productivity apps help you complete your tasks in a timely manner.Here are a few productivity apps we recommend that are available for both iOS and Android devices:DropboxWith Dropbox, you can store important files in one secure place that can be accessed anytime and anywhere.Dropbox is perfect for previewing, editing and sharing files, and can be used even if the person you’re sharing a file with doesn’t have the app.iOS | AndroidGrammarly KeyboardWhen you’re in a hurry, incorporating proper grammar may be the last thing on your mind. Grammarly Keyboard helps keep your messages error-free by checking your writing and offering corrections that you can apply with a simple tap while you type away.iOS | AndroidAsanaThink of Asana as your portable to-do list. You can access and manage your lists from your phone, tablet and computer. What’s even better is that you can share lists with others.It’s perfect for teams to organize, track and manage their work together—even if they’re on opposite sides of town…or the world.iOS | AndroidEvernoteJust like Asana, Evernote can be used for organizing and listing tasks that can be shared with anyone. What’s unique about Evernote is that you can make notes, typed or handwritten, and enhance them with links, attachments, audio recordings and more.iOS | AndroidForestStay focused by growing a forest! You can use the app to set aside a specific amount of time (read our article about the Pomodoro Technique) to complete a task. A tree will plant and grow. When you’re tempted to exit out of the app, like viewing a text message or social media, the tree will die. Forest encourages you to focus on your task at hand by rewarding you with a visual of your successes.iOS | AndroidThere are productivity apps for everything you can think of that are available for everyone, so what are you waiting for? It’s time to start checking off those pesky tasks that have been loitering around for too long.Know a better productivity app or have a favorite we didn’t list?
