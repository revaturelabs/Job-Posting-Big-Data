I'm going to start on it tomorrow, but as far as signature, do I have to print the e-quip after I'm done, and sign it with my signature on the required pages, or can I generate an electronic signature?Also, this BI packet looks easier than the one I did for the USSS. For one thing, it doesn't require me to go all the way from birth for all the places I've lived. Everything is 10 years, which is PERFECT.If I have any questions, I hope you guys and gals can help answer them.ThanksEDIT-I'm using IE9, and I can't get onto e-quip. It says my browser doesn't support 128 bit encryption, yet when I try and DL the encryption packet, it says IE9 supports it already. The TLS 1.0 is already checked, too.I had a lot of issues trying to print out my forms also. Somehow my mom was able to figure it out for me and so I had her print two copies of everything incase I screwed something up.No e-sig, you must print out all the forms and sign them, then when you complete EQIP, you can either scan the signed documents and upload them online or you can fax them to a number. There is a separate attachment in there that has step-by-step instructions on how to do EQIP, the financial disclosure, etc.I hope this helps!Civitas Ad MareLBAPDCBPO 13-1NOR: 9/13TSL: 12/18/13PFT1/Med: 1/14VBT/SI: 5/14 (eligible)BI submitted: 6/25/14 (currently in Security office)Drug test: TBDPolygraph: TBDPFT2: TBDEOD: Hopefully one day!FBI Special AgentOnline App: 8/12/14CommentPostCancelwllyblackForum MemberJoin Date: Feb 2014Posts: 23ShareTweet#4116207-09-2014, 10:46 AMAm overly motivated to realize most of you havn't given up on this.

I'm probably overthinking as usual, and I just started on page one with entering your name, place of birth, and date, but let's say I was born outside of the country. Do I leave \"county\" blank or do I type in \"not applicable.\"Thank youCBP Officer08/31/14-Tested02/28/14-TSL Received03/18/14-PFT1/MED07/01/14-VBT/SI07/19/14-EQUIP Submitted07/22/14-Credit Report PulledCommentPostCancelNYJRM10Forum MemberJoin Date: Aug 2013Posts: 178ShareTweet#4116507-09-2014, 11:23 AMOriginally posted by cur679 View PostOk, I received my e-quip today.

I worked a job back in 2005/2006, and I think I remember contacting them to request a name, and they couldn't tell me.ThanksEDIT-Thanks, NYJ.

I don't have any references from when I lived in any of the apartments I've lived in, which is only two in the past ten years. All the managers are gone, and one person I knew from my previous apartment joined the army.Can I just introduce myself to my neighbor, and inform him/her what I'm doing, and obtain their information? Would be that sufficient?

The more recent he more detailed I am. They can't expect you to remember a phone number from 10 years ago. Their job is to investigate and if they have any questions they will ask you to clarify. I wouldn't stress myself over minute details. Just provide all the information to the best of your knowledgeCommentPostCancelJade78Forum MemberJoin Date: Apr 2014Posts: 483ShareTweet#4116907-09-2014, 12:34 PMOriginally posted by cur679 View PostCan I just introduce myself to my neighbor, and inform him/her what I'm doing, and obtain their information?

ThanksWhile EQIP sounds straight forward and easy, it has too many details that you will have to fill and not forget anything, which makes it challenging coz we have to go back 10 or 7 years back.I introduced myself to my neighbors and took their info, but my BI never went and talked to them, he went to my old neighborhood asking neighbors there that I didnt even know!My advice for you is to gather all the info first, you can print eqip and fill it out by hand so you are sure everything is included, then go online and fill it there, that will save you a lot of headache. I had a big sigh of relief when I submitted it. Good luck and let us know if you have more Qs.CommentPostCancelcur679Forum MemberJoin Date: Aug 2011Posts: 495ShareTweet#4117007-09-2014, 01:00 PMOk, thanks, guys.I may just have to talk to my current neighbhor and ask him for his info. Heck, I don't even think any of the neighbors from my old complex still live there.Also, I'm struggling with the 3 references. I can name two of them, but one of them won't know what my social life is, and he was someone from my gym that I've known for years. We used to communicate via email seldomly. He was actually just in my work a couple days ago, and I asked him for his info.CBP Officer08/31/14-Tested02/28/14-TSL Received03/18/14-PFT1/MED07/01/14-VBT/SI07/19/14-EQUIP Submitted07/22/14-Credit Report PulledCommentPostCancelcur679Forum MemberJoin Date: Aug 2011Posts: 495ShareTweet#4117107-09-2014, 01:25 PMAlready pretty much done. I just need to complete a few more sections, and that's it.Also, as far as drug use, I didn't have a question regarding illegal drug use like marijuana going back further 7 years. I know the poly examiner will still bring it up if I've done any throughout my life, but as far as the equip, it was only 7 years.CBP Officer08/31/14-Tested02/28/14-TSL Received03/18/14-PFT1/MED07/01/14-VBT/SI07/19/14-EQUIP Submitted07/22/14-Credit Report PulledCommentPostCancelCBPO ApplicantForum MemberJoin Date: Jun 2014Posts: 30ShareTweet#4117207-09-2014, 01:26 PM\"Argh.

They need references from all of your previous jobs, where you lived etc. I lived at 10 different places across the country because of my travelling job and they contacted each one of those who I was able to locate. Also keep in mind they would ask for references outside of the names that you already filled out in the e-qip. The BI put me in catch 22 situation when he showed up at my current workplace and started interviewing my co-workers.Geo Midwest	10/18/2013 Written test10/28/2013 NOR1/8/2014	Medical / Fitness - Passed2/14/2014	e-QIP submitted2/18/2014	VBT/SI - Passed5/5/2014	Passed qualifications / GS 7 eligible6/13/2014	Polygraph - Passed6/27/2014	Met the investigator8/26/2014	Drug test8/28/2014	The call10/6/2014	EODNov 3- March 18, 2105 AcademyCommentPostCancelcur679Forum MemberJoin Date: Aug 2011Posts: 495ShareTweet#4117307-09-2014, 01:35 PMI can't provide any references from a job held for a few months back in 2005/2006.
