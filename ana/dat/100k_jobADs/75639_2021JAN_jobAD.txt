I think he would have success but I don’t think he checks the boxes that at least the fan base appears to want. He is also in a beautiful part of the state with a cheaper cost of living. I believe he is one example of a great coach that wouldn’t even get a sniff. The thing is his offense is the new sexy hotness across the country. Coaches all over the place are looking for Costal Carolina film.It will never happen but I still think McPeak from Douglas checks almost all their boxes. He isn’t going to leave Douglas though.Share this postLink to postShare on other sitesHarry Doyle 516Harry Doyle 516Premium MemberPremium Members5163,989 postsPosted January 1438 minutes ago, barrel said:I completely agree.

Nate isn't going anywhere- has it absolutely made at Douglass..Majority of his staff are IN THE BUILDING at FD.They have classes of in school weights.Has a great day job in the building.School is the 'new kid on the block' in Lex (the only weight rooms in the state that are better are UK and Louisville's- I'm not so sure WKU and EKU's are better, all things considered)Fayette County pays better than FTH (teaching and coaching)Cost of living is LOWER in Fayette Co2Share this postLink to postShare on other sitesSweeperboy 432Sweeperboy 432Premium MemberPremium Members4325,221 postsPosted January 1413 minutes ago, Harry Doyle said:Nope.

At the smallest public school Districts you may see this a little more, but even then, your small private schools and any larger schools it is very uncommon to see someone trying to fill a double roll.The big difference is the level of pay in GA. It is not uncommon whatsoever for your top tier coaches to be close to a six figure salary and also have key coordinators who make a very comfortable paycheck from coaching alone.Here is an article from 2019 talking about six figure salary coaches. Entering the 2019 season there were 44 coaches making six figure salaries. Seeing how many of those coaches changed jobs that Summer alone, I am sure this number is well into the 50's. How many KY coaches would be at this level?https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/local/georgia/big-business-number-of-georgia-high-school-football-coaches-making-six-figure-salaries-has-doubled-in-five-years/77-99d3cec6-0852-4d81-a563-117fd68b7c93I know if I were a big booster of a tradition rich program the last thing I would want is my HC having to serve as the AD.Six figures for couching? What about the same for English, math, social study and science teachers? I think we have gone mad!!11Share this postLink to postShare on other sitesTheDeuce 15,301TheDeuce 15,301Premium MemberPremium Members15,30146,304 postsPosted January 1411 minutes ago, Sweeperboy said:Yes, why in the world would he ever consider coming to Highlands.

I did not realize that Highlands would be such a step down but thx for sharing.It is still a good job. A really good job.But I don’t think, well, I know that it’s not the holy grail of coaching gigs by many on the outside looking in. This whole process has shown that.There are reasons for it, then myriad reasons against. It’s not a chink in the armor, but right now? Yeah. It’s a step down all things considered for some.I still believe Highlands will get a good coach. It might not be the name, resume that many expected going into this (then again, they might snag a Nick Saban of HS coaching)..but, the ‘Birds will find their fit. I have no doubts.31Share this postLink to postShare on other sitesHarry Doyle 516Harry Doyle 516Premium MemberPremium Members5163,989 postsPosted January 1410 minutes ago, Jack of all Trades said:I have had several people tell me that certain coaches (head or assistant) would not be a good candidate because of how they look in appearance and/or where they are coming from.

Does this same type of outside perception exist at Trinity, Male, Bowling Green, Mayfield, Beechwood or any of the other top tier programs I did not mention specifically?Share this postLink to postShare on other sitesHarry Doyle 516Harry Doyle 516Premium MemberPremium Members5163,989 postsPosted January 1416 minutes ago, Jack of all Trades said:Could you elaborate on that some?

Does this same type of outside perception exist at Trinity, Male, Bowling Green, Mayfield, Beechwood or any of the other top tier programs I did not mention specifically?Just an “elitist” type mentality more than anything. Not that I’ve ever experienced that, but going off others I know who I know (friends, family and colleagues) who are from that area, worked up in and around there, even interviewed for jobs, etc...a feeling of “yeah. I don’t fit in up there” “I’m not the kind of person they are looking for” “Everybody down here is so much more ‘down home’ & welcoming”.For the record , again, I’ve NEVER experienced that.2Share this postLink to postShare on other sitesPrev345678910111213NextPage 8 of 13Sign in to follow thisFollowers 5Go To Topic ListingRecently Browsing 0 membersNo registered users viewing this page.Football News1Trimble County hires JP Dale as head football coach.By Colonels_Wear_BlueStarted 58 minutes ago29Open Job: Trimble CountyBy TCHSRaiderStarted January 70Anderson County - 2021 ScheduleBy Colonels_Wear_BlueStarted 1 hour ago3Raceland 2021 ScheduleBy GOREDDEVILSStarted 4 hours ago9Open Job: EminenceBy Colonels_Wear_BlueStarted 22 hours agoBasketball News23Covington Catholic at Highlands Predictions/UpdatesBy Ballfan34Started Yesterday at 03:03 PM29No dunking while the refs are on the court.By Colonels_Wear_BlueStarted Wednesday at 01:47 AM0Newport 57 Boone County 52By mcpapaStarted 26 minutes ago0Scott 62 Harlan County 56By mcpapaStarted 29 minutes ago10Covington Catholic 51 Trinity 50By Colonels_Wear_BlueStarted 20 hours agoPopular ContributorsWeekMonthYearAll Time1Colonels_Wear_Blue782theguru593ChiefSmoke444TheDeuce415Tigerpride9438Show MoreAll ActivityHomeForumsKentucky High School SportsKY Football (High School)Is Highlands still a top job?TermsPrivacy PolicyContact UsCopyright © BluegrassPreps.com, INC Powered by Invision Community×Existing user?
