Use GIPHY5 Ways to Dominate Social Media Marketing in 2020Leading into 2020, social networks appear primed for both active engagement and active scrutiny, and social media companies may quickly change how they operate as a result.For example, Twitter recently announced they would stop allowing political advertising, and networks like Instagram are experimenting with hiding the number of likes on posts in an effort to reverse the negative mental health effects associated with social media comparisons, as Smardart reports.For marketers, even if these changes do not seem to apply directly to your brand, they underscore the point that social media marketers tend to operate on rented land.

Lead generation by gathering dataWhile in the past your brand may have valued metrics like followers and likes, it’s becoming increasingly clear that these measures tend to not carry much weight. What’s more important is your ability to generate quality leads so you can market to them directly, rather than being entirely reliant on social media networks, especially when likes fail to translate to sales.As such, you should aim to use social media as a feeder source for capturing data such as email addresses and phone numbers.A great way to do this is to drive social media users to a landing page on your website, where visitors can opt-in to receive something of value, like an e-book, in exchange for their contact information.From there, you can use that data on your own terms, whether you choose to retarget through Facebook ads, incorporate new contacts into your email marketing or however else.6 Websites to Find and Keep a Remote JobSocial Media Marketing2. Text message marketing with SuperPhoneLast year, I interviewed hip-hop artist Ryan Leslie who launched a new mobile messaging platform called SuperPhone, and now I’m using SuperPhone to take my social media marketing to the next level.

Private messaging on WhatsApp and SlackIt can be tough to stand out amidst all the noise on social media, which is why social media marketing in 2020 should include ways to link your social media efforts to other marketing methods.Along the same lines of collecting data and engaging in text message marketing, you can also use the major social media networks as a feeder source for creating private groups on messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Slack.Focus on your most engaged or connected followers, which you can identify through a social listening platform like Sprinklr, and invite them to join a private group on WhatsApp or Slack.From there, you can bypass the noise on the major social media networks and engage directly with your superfans, such as sharing sneak-peek news with them or soliciting their opinions on new products or services you’re planning to offer. From there, these engaged fans can spread the word about your brand organically through traditional social media channels.Social Media Marketing4.
