Therefore, I'm curious - where are the best teaching positions right now, especially if I want to limit my search to university positions and/or institutions with adult students? (I don't have any experience teaching people under the age of 1 .A little about me:My name is Heather and I'm an ESL Instructor. I currently teach seven classes/week for adult learners in San Bernardino, CA.Although I love my job, I feel like it's time for a change. I've lived overseas before and I would really like the chance to immerse myself in a new culture and language. Life is short and the planet is big...Education:TEFL Certificate from University of California, RiversideM.A. in English from Loyola Marymount Unviersity, Los AngelesB.A. in English from University of California, Los AngelesCertificate in Teaching Italian from University of Genoa, ItalyExperience:Adjunct Faculty at Loyola Marymount University for two years:College Writing, ESL Business English, LiteratureAdjunct Faculty at University of California, Riverside for four years:ESL Intermediate/Advanced Writing, ESL Intermediate/Advanced Speaking/Listening, Mythology, Gender Studies, Italian.Associate Faculty at Ashford University for one year:College WritingInstructor at the Asian American Resource Center for one year:ESL Beginning, Intermediate, and AdvancedAll told, I have 10+ years experience in adult education, 7 of them teaching in four-year universities. I also speak Spanish and Italian.I'm not materialistic, and I'm not looking for a huge income. Just a place to meet new people and learn a new language.So where are the best markets for university teaching positions right now? What do you all think? Also, do you see any red flags or omissions in the above info? I am open to feedback and eager to learn from you all.Thanks for your time,HeatherBack to topnomad soulJoined: 31 Jan 2010Posts: 11454Location: The real worldPosted: Thu Sep 22, 2016 3:04 am Post subject:Possible locations:KazakhstanTurkeyMexicoChinaYou'd have to get more info in terms of cities, when to apply, salary ranges, etc., via the specific country forums.There's also the English Language Fellow (ELF) Program, although the application process is tedious.Back to topMsHoffmanJoined: 18 Sep 2016Posts: 76Posted: Thu Sep 22, 2016 3:13 am Post subject: Thanks for the infoThanks for your quick reply, I'll definitely look into those countries.

Proulex is a language center associated with the University.Back to topDisplay posts from previous: All Posts1 Day7 Days2 Weeks1 Month3 Months6 Months1 Year Oldest FirstNewest FirstJob Discussion Forums Forum Index -> Newbie Forum All times are GMTPage 1 of 1Jump to: Select a forum Where to Begin----------------General DiscussionNewbie ForumCurrent Events ForumTechnology ForumOnline Teaching Forum Africa Forums----------------General Africa Forum Asia Forums----------------CambodiaChina (Job-related Posts Only)China (Off-Topic)Hong KongIndiaIndonesiaJapanMalaysiaPhilippinesSingaporeTaiwanThailandGeneral Asia ForumVietnam Caribbean Forums----------------General Caribbean Forum Europe Forums----------------Czech RepublicFranceGermanyGreeceItalyMacedonia and the BalkansPolandRomaniaRussia & C.I.S.SpainTurkeyUkraineUnited KingdomGeneral Europe Forum Latin America Forums----------------ArgentinaBrazilChileColombiaCosta RicaMexicoMexico (off-topic)PeruGeneral Latin America Forum The Middle East Forums----------------BahrainEgyptIsraelKuwaitOmanQatarSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesGeneral Middle East Forum North America Forums----------------General North America Forum Oceania----------------Australia/New ZealandYou cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forumThis page is maintained by the one and only Dave Sperling.Contact Dave's ESL CafeCopyright © 2018 Dave Sperling.
