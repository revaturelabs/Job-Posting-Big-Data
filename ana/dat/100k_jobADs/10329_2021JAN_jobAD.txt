I created a remix for Janet Jackson's Someone To Call My Lover as a fun vibey track and am looking to release it digitally for free on Janet's birthday. I'm not looking to profit off this, and its the same reason why I can't pay $600 for a mix. (I'd have to save up for almost a month to just even afford that with my part time job.) There are 20 tracks in the project, 5 tracks are just effects alone that are not EQ'd. The vocals are sidechained to to a ghost channel that will not have a track, The bassline and some chord tracks are sidechained to the main kick track.I'd like to have the job done byMay 14, 2014Post a job similar to thisor sign up to reply to jobs like thiscloseRefer Richard to another SoundBetter proThe pro will know that you referred Richard, and may then refer clients to youWho would you like to refer?Send referralcloseWhat can we help you with?Tell us more about your project:Need help?
