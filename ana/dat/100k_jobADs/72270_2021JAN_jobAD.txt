Corrupted profession!I'm a junior faculty and I find this extremely discouraging and frustrating. People like him can generate multiple papers with fake results and never get punished.

Yes, you read that right. They actually forgot that Stata sorts in ascending order by default. Shortly after the EJMR posts were made, SK+AB revised their SSRN response by deleting all of their faulty code and tables.See for yourself, https://www.filedropper.com/byaccountingresponseorigI admit I followed this case only superficially, and I found the whole \"replication kit\" and \"my notebook died\" rather unconvincing.
