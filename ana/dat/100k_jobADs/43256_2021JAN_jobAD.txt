The airport, owned by New Zealand company Infratil, has been losing money on its operations and needed to cut costs to give it a more secure future.Airport chiefs recently examined working patterns to see where cost savings could be made. This process and staff consultation has identified savings of more than £350,000 and the loss of four roles. Charles Buchanan, airport chief executive, said:“As the airport strives to attract new business, it is important that the cost base is kept as low as possible and we reduce the airport’s current operating losses. Increasing the attractiveness of the airport to potential new customers, both through low airport charges and flexible operating conditions, will be key to ensuring the business becomes a commercial success. As a result of the consultation the airport is now on a more sustainable footing for the future as we seek to grow the business.”The airport has attracted Flybe scheduled services to Edinburgh and Belfast but lost the Manchester service in April because of poor passenger numbers. Several holiday charter operations use the airport which earns substantial revenue from its freight operations.Mr Buchanan has spoken to a number of airlines to try and attract more scheduled passenger services. A spokesman confirmed that talks have been held with representatives of a new airline that is considering introducing direct flights to New York.kentonline 26th Jul 2011SharetweetTags Belfast Charles Buchanan Edinburgh Employment FlyBe Infratil Manchester Manston Airport Mr Buchanan New York New Zealand NNF2011Previous Woken in the small hours, 10th JulyNext Big Apple pie in the skyRelated ArticlesManston airport didn’t work, and neither will RiverOak’s plan2015-04-30Social media proves to be election battlefield2015-04-15Ukip manifesto pledge to re-open Manston2015-04-14Check AlsoUkip leader Nigel Farage attacks rivals over Manston Airport interestUkip leader Nigel Farage says his party should take the credit for forcing election rivals …ArchivesArchives Select Month February 2018 September 2017 April 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 October 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 February 2016 November 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 March 2008 February 2008 June 2007 February 2007 December 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 May 2006 February 2006 January 2006 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 October 2004 September 2004 June 2004 May 2004 March 2004 February 2004 January 2003 August 2002 July 2002 March 2002 January 2000 0Weather Guess...All original material copyright © 2010-2021 HerneBayMatters.com All rights reserved.
