Similarly, the investment goods sector was especially hard hit in September, seeing the sharpest drops in production and new business, as clients reined in capital spending while conditions remained volatile.”“The shroud of uncertainty also weighed on manufacturers’ confidence, which remained at one of its lowest ebbs in the survey’s history. These headwinds all ensure that manufacturing will likely remain a drag on UK economic growth during the months ahead.”Seamus Nevin, Chief Economist at Make UK, said: “At the end of this month the UK is set to leave the EU, and as the uncertainty grows, levels of output, new orders, new export business, investment, and employment are continuing to fall.”“Were it not for the emergency stockpiling activities that took place ahead of our original EU exit date last March, the UK manufacturing sector would already be in recession. Stocks of purchase and input buying volumes have now started to rise again, as companies recommence their costly no-deal Brexit contingency activities.”“Job losses are widespread across the sector as its continued weakness has seen employment fall at the most severe rate since the peak of the Global Financial Crisis. There are now roughly 126,000 fewer people working in the industry than there were in June 2016.”“UK manufacturers are also losing customers and production continued to contract in September as companies cut back output in response to further reductions in new orders received.”“While global markets are also faltering, with orders from the USA and Asia are shrinking, and growth in the Eurozone, the UK’s biggest export market, declining slightly following last month’s improvement, anxiety about the UK’s post-Brexit trade rules is clearly the biggest factor affecting British manufacturers right now.”Back to Search ResultsTagsLead Economy Brexit UK Manufacturing IHS Markit Industry Make UKby Tom Walker1 October 201915:26View moreHomeIndustry NewsMachineryMaterialsEnvironmentEventsBlogsBPF BlogLeanne Taylor's BlogGuest BlogTom Walker's BlogSubscribeMagazineAbout UsAdvertiseTerms & ConditionsContact UsPrivacy Policy and GDPR© 2020 Rapid Plastics Media Ltd.
