As the wellbeing of healthcare staff directly correlates with the quality of maternity care, this distress must be met with adequate support provision. As such, the identification and appraisal of interventions designed to support midwives and student midwives in work-related psychological distress will be important in the pursuit of excellence in maternity care.Tags:systematic reviewReviewAnalysisMeditationAltered StateMeditative stateConsciousnessBurnout, ProfessionalEmployee assistance programsJob SatisfactionMidwivesStress, Occupationalsystematic reviewAuthor(s):Pezaro, SallyClyne, WendyFulton, Emily A.Methods for Alleviating Stress and Increasing Resilience in the Midwifery Community: A Scoping Review of the LiteraturePublication Title:Journal of Midwifery & Women's HealthINTRODUCTION: Work-related stress and exposure to traumatic birth have deleterious impacts on midwifery practice, the midwife's physiologic well-being, and the midwifery workforce. This is a global phenomenon, and the specific sources of this stress vary dependent on practice setting. This scoping review aims to determine which, if any, modalities help to reduce stress and increase resilience among a population of midwives.Tags:systematic reviewReviewAnalysisMeditationAltered StateMeditative stateConsciousnessCopingJob SatisfactionMidwivesmindfulness-based stress reductionresilienceStressAuthor(s):Wright, Erin M.Matthai, Maude TheoWarren, NicoleA mixed-methods systematic review of the effects of mindfulness on nursesPublication Title:Journal of Advanced NursingAIM: To review the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on Registered Nurses and nursing students.

There is minimal research on the use of mindfulness with social workers. As demonstrated in other professional and helping fields, mindfulness may enhance clinical skills, reduce burnout, and increase job satisfaction among social workers. In the health care field mindfulness appears integral to patient and family relationships and personal resilience.Tags:systematic reviewReviewAnalysisMeditationAltered StateMeditative stateConsciousnessBurnout, ProfessionalEmpathyHealth care social workHumansJob SatisfactionMental HealthMindfulnessmindfulness-based interventionsPatient-Centered CareQuality of Health Careself-reflectionSocial WorkersStress, PsychologicalStudentsAuthor(s):Trowbridge, KellyMische Lawson, LisaSystematic Review of Mindfulness Practice for Reducing Job BurnoutPublication Title:The American Journal of Occupational Therapy: Official Publication of the American Occupational Therapy AssociationOBJECTIVE: A systematic search and critical appraisal of interdisciplinary literature was conducted to evaluate the evidence for practicing mindfulness to treat job burnout and to explore implications for occupational therapy practitioners.

BACKGROUND: Nursing is a profession that can easily lead to burnout. Burnout has been one of the most investigated work outcomes in current research. Previous research has largely ignored the positive influence of individuals on job outcomes and has not tested a constructive framework that might facilitate interventions to prevent burnout.Tags:Adaptation, PsychologicalAttitude of Health PersonnelBurnoutBurnout, ProfessionalCross-Sectional StudiesFemaleHumansJob SatisfactionMaleNursesOptimismproactive copingStress, PsychologicalSurveys and QuestionnairesTaiwanEmotionsCulturehumanityHopetendernessgratitudethankfulnessOptimismgenerosityWellnessAuthor(s):Chang, YuhsuanChan, Hsin-JuChildhood peer reputation as a predictor of competence and symptoms 10 years laterPublication Title:Journal of Abnormal Child PsychologyThis study examined the differential developmental significance of multiple domains of peer reputation in childhood for current and future competence and symptoms. Participants were 205 children from a normative school cohort who completed assessments in grades 3-6 and then again 10 years later. Through re-analysis of original data from the Revised Class Play (RCP; N=612), new narrow-band subscales were examined as distinct correlates and predictors of competence in age-relevant developmental tasks and psychological well being as indexed by internalizing symptoms.Tags:AchievementAdaptation, PsychologicalAdultAge FactorsAggressionAttention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior DisordersChildDepressive Disorder, MajorEmploymentFemaleHumansJob SatisfactionLeadershipLoveMalePeer GroupSocial AdjustmentSocial BehaviorSocial DesirabilityEmotionsCulturehumanityAltruismtendernesskindnesscompassionLoveEmpathyWellnessAuthor(s):Gest, Scott D.Sesma, ArturoMasten, Ann S.Tellegen, AukeLove, work, and changes in extraversion and neuroticism over timePublication Title:Journal of Personality and Social PsychologyThe present study examined individual differences in change in extraversion, neuroticism, and work and relationship satisfaction. Of particular interest were the correlations between changes. Data were from the Victorian Quality of Life Panel Study (B. Headey & A. Wearing, 1989, 1992), in which an overall 1,130 individuals participated (ages 16 to 70). Respondents were assessed every 2 years from 1981 to 1989. Four major findings emerged. (a) There were significant individual differences in changes in extraversion and neuroticism. (b) Change was not limited to young adulthood.Tags:AdolescentAdultAgedExtraversion (Psychology)FemaleHumansIndividualityJob SatisfactionLongitudinal StudiesLoveMaleMiddle AgedModels, StatisticalNeurotic DisordersPersonality DevelopmentPersonality InventoryQuality of LifeReproducibility of ResultsStatistics as TopicVictoriaEmotionsCulturehumanityAltruismtendernesskindnesscompassionLoveEmpathyWellnessAuthor(s):Scollon, Christie NapaDiener, Ed[Mothers' adherence to \"maternal love\" influences emotional expression toward children: relation to maternal occupational status and satisfaction in the workplace]Publication Title:Shinrigaku Kenkyu: The Japanese Journal of PsychologyThis study examined the impact of mothers' adherence to \"maternal love\" on maternal emotional expression toward their children. It was postulated that adherence to \"maternal love\" (defined as the tendency to accept and obey blindly the traditional maternal role and sociocultural belief in \"desirable mothers\") would have both positive and negative effects on maternal emotional expression, depending on the mothers' occupational status and satisfaction in workplace.Tags:AdultChildEmotionsFemaleHumansJob SatisfactionLoveMiddle AgedMother-Child RelationsMothersOccupationsWorkplaceEmotionsCulturehumanityAltruismtendernesskindnesscompassionLoveEmpathyWellnessAuthor(s):Egami, SonokoVocation in theology-based nursing theoriesPublication Title:Nursing EthicsBy using the concepts of intrinsicality/extrinsicality as analytic tools, the theology-based nursing theories of Ann Bradshaw and Katie Eriksson are analyzed regarding their explicit and/or implicit understanding of vocation as a motivational factor for nursing. The results show that both theories view intrinsic values as guarantees against reducing nursing practice to mechanistic applications of techniques and as being a way of reinforcing a high ethical standard.Tags:AltruismAttitude of Health PersonnelCareer ChoiceChristianityEmpathyEthical AnalysisEthics, NursingFreedomGoalsHumansJob SatisfactionLoveMoralsMotivationNurse-Patient RelationsNurse's RoleNursing Evaluation ResearchNursing TheoryPhilosophy, NursingReligion and PsychologySpiritualityTheologyValue of LifeEmotionsCulturehumanityAltruismtendernesskindnesscompassionLoveEmpathyWellnessAuthor(s):Lundmark, MikaelPages1234567next ›last »© The Chopra Library for Integrative Studies & Whole Health is a program of the Chopra Library for Integrative Studies & Whole Health LLC, which is a Chopra Foundation Initiative and a 501(c)(3) nonprofit public charity.Please review the privacy policy of the Chopra Library for Integrative Studies & Whole Health"
