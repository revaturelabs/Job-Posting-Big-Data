Security forces prevented them from marching towards a main Tunis thoroughfare.A Reuters reporter saw at least a dozen protesters sustaining light injuries from police batons, mainly to the head. Some others fainted.Protests are rare in Tunisia, which has been run for 23 years by President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and works closely with Western governments, but have been gathering force in recent weeks.The Tunis protest followed the deadly shooting by police of a jobless graduate in Bouziane, south of Tunis, last Friday. Clashes broke out earlier this month in the town of Sidi Bouzid after a man committed suicide in a protest about unemployment. The protests later spread to several neighbouring cities such as Sousse, Sfax and Meknassi.One young woman at the Tunis demonstration told Reuters: \"Our demand is employment...We are here to support the youth of Sidi Bouzid and demand work\".The protesters chanted slogans such as \"We need work\" and \"Stop the corruption\", and carried banners including one that read \"Free Sidi Bouzid's prisoners\".Officials have declined to say how many people were detained over the clashes in Sidi Bouzid.Tunisia remains relatively prosperous compared to African peers but several international right groups say its government crushes dissent, an accusation it denies.The North African country has become a regional focus for international financial institutions since announcing a plan to complete current account convertibility of its dinar currency over the 2010-2012 period.ReutersLast Mod: 28 Aralık 2010, 16:30#2Add CommentYorumunuz Onaylanmak Üzere GönderildiName and SurmaneCommentSendReply Text : @name×Oil prices up still buoyed by OPEC+ output cutEconomyFree trade deal eases Turkey-UK trade target of $20BEconomyTurkey attracts 12M tourists in first 11 months of 2020EconomyOil prices climb as US oil inventories fallEconomyOil prices down over pandemic-driven demand fearsEconomyFacebook847.6BTwitter0POOLAll PoolsAre you considering getting a Covid vaccine?YesNoSeçim Yapmadınız!Daha önce oy verdiniz!Oy verme işlemi tamamlandı!RESULTSVOTEPRAYER TIMESAdana Adıyaman Afyon Ağrı Aksaray Amasya Ankara Antalya Ardahan Artvin Aydın Balıkesir Bartın Batman Bayburt Bilecik Bingöl Bitlis Bolu Burdur Bursa Çanakkale Çankırı Çorum Denizli Diyarbakır Düzce Edirne Elazığ Erzincan Erzurum Eskişehir Gaziantep Giresun Gümüşhane Hakkari Hatay Iğdır Isparta İstanbul İzmir Kahramanmaraş Karabük Karaman Kars Kastamonu Kayseri Kırıkkale Kırklareli Kırşehir Kilis Kocaeli Konya Kütahya Malatya Manisa Mardin Mersin Muğla Muş Nevşehir Niğde Ordu Osmaniye Rize Sakarya Samsun Siirt Sinop Sivas Şanlıurfa Şırnak Tekirdağ Tokat Trabzon Tunceli Uşak Van Yalova Yozgat ZonguldakFAJR06:50TULU08:20ZUHR13:18ASR15:45MAGRIB18:07ISHA19:32SAYFALARAll SayfalarPRIVACY AND PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION POLICYHOMEABOUT USADVERTORIALCONTACT+ ADD TO YOUR SITEWorldIslamic WorldTurkeyNews AnalysisMediaEconomyArt & CultureHealth & EnvironmentScience&TechnologyHistoryInterviews & In DepthArchiveArticle & CommentRamadanFileboxIslamophobiaThe contents of all material available on this website are copyrighted.
