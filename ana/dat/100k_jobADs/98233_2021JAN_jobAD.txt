These include the creation of good jobs capable of supporting families, energy and mineral policies that help grow America’s manufacturing economy.“American businesses and their workforce confront a conveyor belt of regulation after regulation demonstrating a troubling indifference to costs that destroy investment and high-wage jobs in return for little if any benefit.“The results today are predictable. Despite the president’s second-term goal to create one million manufacturing jobs, there is contraction in manufacturing, massive job losses in mining, forecasts of rising electricity prices, and growing reliance on imports of minerals and metals.“More balance and less regulatory overreach would instill much needed confidence that our government wants to help American business and workers succeed.”Date: Monday, 11 January 2016 21:08Last Updated on Monday, 11 January 2016 21:08Related ContentNMA Statement on InaugurationWASHINGTON, D.C. – The National Mining Association (NMA) today issued the following statement from Rich Nolan, President and CEO, on next week's...
