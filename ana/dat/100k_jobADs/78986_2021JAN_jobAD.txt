The report showed that the logging industry experienced the highest rate of fatal accidents during 2018. Roofers also made the top 10 list. They experienced fewer workplace fatalities than the top three dangerous industries, but they also suffered nearly twice as many serious injuries as loggers did in the top spot.As reported by CNBC, roofers often bend, climb and lift heavy objects. These are actions that can cause a worker to experience burn-out and exhaustion, especially when working in outdoor summer temperatures. It may account for the number of roofers stumbling or falling off a roof. While federal law requires employers to provide fall-protection, safety gear and scaffolds, accidents still occur when least expected.Because roofing is a seasonal occupation, contractors may overschedule repair or installation projects during the months when the weather permits the work. Rushing through projects, however, can contribute to increased accidents and severe injuries.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration issues the most citations to roofing contractors for workplace violations, as reported by Business and Legal Resources EHS. An employer’s repeated citations for sending its workers to job sites lacking fall protection and ladders with safety side rails resulted in one of OSHA’s highest fines.There is no requirement for an injured employee to prove that he or she was not at fault to file a claim for workers’ compensation. Any injury that occurs during the course of an employee carrying out his or her regular duties may qualify for benefits. An employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier may cover an injured worker’s medical expenses, physical therapy and loss of wages during recovery.FacebookTwitterLinkedInSearch for:CategoriesAdmiralty & Maritime Law (44)Blog (14)Car Accidents (223)Firm News (2)Medical Malpractice (133)Motorcycle Accidents (7)Personal Injury (1)Spinal Cord Injuries (30)Truck Accidents (1)Uncategorized (26)Workers' Compensation (79)Wrongful Death (103)ArchivesJanuary 2021 (5)December 2020 (5)November 2020 (6)October 2020 (3)September 2020 (6)August 2020 (5)July 2020 (5)June 2020 (6)May 2020 (4)April 2020 (5)March 2020 (14)January 2020 (7)December 2019 (8)November 2019 (9)October 2019 (12)September 2019 (9)August 2019 (11)July 2019 (9)June 2019 (9)May 2019 (11)April 2019 (9)March 2019 (9)February 2019 (9)January 2019 (11)December 2018 (7)November 2018 (11)October 2018 (9)September 2018 (9)August 2018 (11)July 2018 (9)June 2018 (9)May 2018 (11)April 2018 (9)March 2018 (11)February 2018 (8)January 2018 (10)December 2017 (10)November 2017 (10)October 2017 (9)September 2017 (11)August 2017 (9)July 2017 (9)June 2017 (10)May 2017 (10)April 2017 (10)March 2017 (10)February 2017 (9)January 2017 (9)December 2016 (10)November 2016 (4)October 2016 (4)September 2016 (4)August 2016 (5)July 2016 (4)June 2016 (6)May 2016 (4)April 2016 (5)March 2016 (9)February 2016 (7)January 2016 (8)December 2015 (9)November 2015 (8)October 2015 (7)September 2015 (6)August 2015 (6)July 2015 (7)June 2015 (5)May 2015 (4)April 2015 (5)March 2015 (4)February 2015 (4)January 2015 (5)December 2014 (4)November 2014 (4)October 2014 (5)September 2014 (4)August 2014 (4)July 2014 (5)June 2014 (4)May 2014 (5)April 2014 (4)March 2014 (4)February 2014 (4)January 2014 (4)December 2013 (5)November 2013 (4)October 2013 (5)September 2013 (4)August 2013 (4)July 2013 (4)June 2013 (4)May 2013 (5)April 2013 (4)March 2013 (4)February 2013 (4)January 2013 (4)December 2012 (2)Recent PostsOwners of hurricane-damaged homes should watch for fraudCrash reconstruction experts help win casesPersonal injury attorneys work on a contingencyVocational rehabilitation and your return to workHow can I stay safe as a pedestrian?Subscribe To This Blog's FeedLet Us Help!EMAIL US FOR A RESPONSEOffice LocationThe Townsley Law Firm3102 Enterprise BoulevardLake Charles, LA 70601Lake Charles LA Office MapPhone: 337-377-0584Toll Free: 800-216-6808Fax: 337-478-1577Follow Us OnFollowFollowFollowREVIEW US© 2021 The Townsley Law Firm.
