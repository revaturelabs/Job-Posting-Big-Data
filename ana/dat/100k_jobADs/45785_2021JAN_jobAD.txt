For college students, that often means trying to find resume-enhancing opportunities that align with their studies or future careers. After all, a good summer job can provide a lot more than extra cash. It can help pave your way to the kind of life that you really want after college.Consider why that is: Seasonal jobs often give students their first exposure to real work settings. By getting a temporary job or internship during a break from school, it's possible to start developing skills and gathering contacts that will help you transition more easily from student to professional. The experiences that you acquire will likely contribute to your discovery of new talents, personal interests, and work preferences. And they can make you better at managing your money and making smart decisions.So the potential benefits are rather abundant for a typical college student. Summer jobs frequently increase the likelihood for future success. That's probably why, between April and July each year, the number of young people who have jobs, or are looking for work, rises sharply.In July of 2015 alone, about 20.3 million people between the ages of 16 and 24 were employed in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. About 27 percent of them had jobs related to the hospitality, culinary, and leisure industries. Roughly 20 percent of them worked in retail. And 11 percent of them had jobs related to health or education services. The rest of them were employed in a wide variety of other sectors.Depending on your location, finding good summer jobs for students can sometimes be a little tricky. But a lot of cities have summer youth employment programs that can help match you to seasonal opportunities. Plus, according to the Urban Institute, some program partners (including those in the private sector) provide hands-on mentorship and assist youth with professional development.In addition, the White House has launched the Summer Opportunity Project, which should help create new jobs and internships all over America. It's an initiative that brings together a large variety of leaders, schools, and public and non-profit agencies at the local and state levels in order to increase the availability of summer opportunities for students and other young people.National wage estimates are from 2019 Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program data unless indicated as being from (1) PayScale.Summer Jobs That Are Mostly OutdoorsWhat's better than enjoying the sunshine and fresh, warm air during your summer break? With an open mind and a little advanced effort, you can find opportunities that let you get paid for working mostly outside. And some jobs will also keep you physically active so that you have a chance to return to school in better shape than when you left.Many of the best summer jobs in this category are in wilderness areas. For example, beach and mountain resorts, summer camps, and state and national parks tend to generate a lot of seasonal opportunities for current college students who want to work in the great outdoors. You could lead hiking expeditions into the backcountry or help people enjoy fun activities like swimming, zip lining, archery, whitewater rafting, or outdoor photography.Of course, plenty of outdoor jobs are also available in cities and non-wilderness areas. Most employers will provide on-the-job training. And some of them will also cover the cost of getting certified in CPR and first aid if that is required for the work. But you might stand out among other job candidates if you have some formal training related to tourism or recreation management.Here are several examples of outdoor summer jobs.1.

A little bit of it can sometimes go a long way. So wanting to stay cool by working inside is perfectly normal. And plenty of summer opportunities enable college students to do exactly that. They often feature interesting work in indoor settings while still providing chances to duck out and get some sunshine now and then.Retail and restaurant jobs are, of course, a very common part of this category.
