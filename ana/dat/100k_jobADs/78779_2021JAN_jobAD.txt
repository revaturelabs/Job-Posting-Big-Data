I have read the Book of Job many times, and the last time I read it, I really liked it. I liked that he had tremendous faith. I liked that he had the fortitude to even respond to his “friends” who were not being very understanding of his situation. I liked that although he had some pretty frank discussions with God, he ultimately revered and trusted in Him.Last year, my sister told me she was supposed to read the Book of Job, and she really didn’t enjoy that book of the Bible. I told her all these encouraging words about how great Job was and how amazing his faith was. I told her that this was a story of triumph. Yes, it was a difficult story, but it had a really good ending.Today, I am about halfway through Job. I should have already read it by now. I just cannot seem to want to read it. Here I was, encouraging my sister when heavy things were coming into her life. And now that I am heading there, I’m running away. I have had to force myself to read Job. How hypocritical am I? This is embarrassing to admit, but I have let my feelings get in the way of listening to God. Because I am not feeling good about reading Job, I’ve dragged my feet. I’ve even taken to reading Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations! My son told me it was a good book, and even though I have read it before, I thought now would be a good time to dive into this massive piece of fiction! Ha, Ha. Oh the lengths we go to so that we can avoid facing what we need to face.Tonight, I plan to read another chapter of Job. I plan to listen to what God has to say to me. Then, I will fall asleep finding out what’s in store for Pip. I have a feeling that his “great expectations” may not end up so great after all.Leave a comment	Search for:Recent PostsSprinting for GodWhen St. Francis and St. Anthony Show Up At Your HouseRunning and winning my first and only 5K raceA Toy Maker, a Drug Addict and my Guardian AngelFinding The Little FlowerRecent CommentsURL on I Found the Hidden Treasu…Homepage on I Found the Hidden Treasu…URL on Which Poverty Would You P…Emely on Declutter and Detach: Two Step…Leanne on Are you a human being or a hum…ArchivesMarch 2016October 2014July 2014June 2014May 2014April 2014March 2014February 2014CategoriesAccountabilityActs of CharityBaptismBeautyBibleCommunityDifficult TimesDishonestyDoing God's WillEasterEternal SalvationEvangelizationFaithFamilyFastingForgivenessGiftsGifts of the Holy SpiritGraceGratitudeGrowing Close to GodGuardian AngelHappiness & JoyHard WorkHoly SpiritHonestyHumilityHumorIndwelling of the Holy TrinityJoyJusticeKeeping holy the Sabbath DayLaughterLetting GoLifeListeningLoveMarriage RelationshipMercyMotherhoodObedienceOriginal SinPatiencePerseverancePovertyPrayerPurityResurrectionRomanceScriptureSelfishnessSelling on the InternetServingSharing Jesus ChristTaking TurnsTeamworkTrue FreedomTrusting in GodTruthUncategorizedUnderstandingWaitingWeaknessWisdomWise CounselMetaRegisterLog inEntries feedComments feedWordPress.comCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.Privacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
