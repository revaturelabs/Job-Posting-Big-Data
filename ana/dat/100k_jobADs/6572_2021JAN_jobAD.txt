The cuts will include both voluntary and involuntary layoffs, the company citing the knock-on effects of the COVID-19 pandemic for the drastic action.With American passenger air travel demand having plummeted by 95% and a general consensus that little will change until 2021, along with it likely taking many more years before travel returns to 2019 levels, GE has joined the ranks of Boeing Co which announced last week that it was reducing its workforce by 10%, which equates to approximately 16,000 jobs, while Spirit AeroSystems Holdings is to cut a further 1.450 jobs in Kansas.The announcement includes the 10% cut in workforce announced in March as part of a US$3 billion cost-cutting and cash-saving exercise at GE Aviation. According to GE Aviation’s chief executive, David Joyce, the “deep contraction of commercial aviation is unprecedented, affecting every customer worldwide. Global traffic is expected to be down approximately 80% in the second quarter.”GE Aviation had previously invoked furloughs covering roughly 50% of its maintenance, repair and overhaul workforce and new engine production. To date, neither GE nor Boeing have applied for U.S. government assistance from the US$17 billion treasury fund.Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)RelatedEmail Post to a FriendPost navigationPrevious Previous post: Airbus and Koniku embark on disruptive biotechnology solutionsNext Next post: SAS signs SEK 3.3 billion revolving credit facility agreement2021 Media KitTop StoriesAircraft & EnginesMRO & ProductionFinancialPeopleMilitary & DefenseOtherArchivesDaily News AlertWeekly HeadlinesMonthly MRO...AdvertisingOverviewMonthly MRO MagazineMRO Editorial CalendarWeekly Aviation HeadlinesWeekly Aviation MarketplaceDaily Aviation News AlertWebsite BannersAdvertorialsTechnical SpecificationsTestimonialsPrivacy/LegalAbout AviTraderOur TeamContact UsCopyright © 2021 AviTrader Publications Corporation.
