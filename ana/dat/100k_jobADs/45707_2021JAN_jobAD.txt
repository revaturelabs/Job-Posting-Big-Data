An Embassy is also, considered as the residence and headquarters for the ambassador, who is the chief representative of one country in another.How Can an Embassy Help you?Your embassy can help you if you’ve been the victim of serious crime or have fallen ill abroad. This could be offering contacts of local lawyers and doctors, advise you on how to transfer funds and help broker contact to your family at home.They can’t provide you with money or remuneration, investigate a crime, become involved in the legal process or improve your healthcare beyond what is available to locals.If you are arrested overseas, you will need to contact your embassy. They can offer you assistance such as a list of English-speaking lawyers and local interpreters (which are not recommendations), as well as guides to the country’s legal processes.They cannot intervene in court cases, prevent deportation, pay any costs, secure your release from jail or forward correspondence from your friends or family.However, they can communicate what has happened to your loved ones, aim to contact you within 24 hours of your arrest and pay you a visit as soon as possible. They aim to be non-judgemental and sensitive regardless of the accusations made against you.Embassies and consulates can also help validate documents for use in the country you’re visiting. Registering births, deaths and marriages abroad will all require you to talk to your embassy.U.N Jobs in Middle EastPartnerships Officer Job Vacancy at United Nations WFP in Beirut, LebanonPrerna Jain -
