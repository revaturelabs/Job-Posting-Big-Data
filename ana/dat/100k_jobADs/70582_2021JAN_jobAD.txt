In those cases, Education to Work systems “channel, socialise and label young people in ways which match their Labour Market destinations, transitions are smoother, faster, more predictable and involve fewer job changes.”The Education to Work transitions systems are in synergy with their educational, social, political and economic settings. “The values and assumptions underpinning institutions and policies are reflected in transition patterns and outcomes.”A qualifications framework does a lot in bringing Education to Work transitions systems in line with labour Market Outcomes. “A qualifications framework is an instrument for the development and classification of qualifications according to a set of criteria for levels of learning achieved…. The scope of frameworks may be comprehensive of all learning achievement and pathways or may be confined to a particular sector…. Some frameworks may have more design elements and a tighter structure than others; some may have a legal basis whereas others represent a consensus of views of social partners. All qualifications frameworks, however, establish a basis for improving the quality, accessibility, linkages and public or labour market recognition of qualifications within a country and internationally.” (OECD 2007, cited by Raffer)Hence, according to Raffer, introducing such a system requires:Time: for cultural change, to establish trust, learn language (need to manage expectations)Stakeholder involvement and partnership: to populate NQF, change institutional logics, ensure deep implementationEffective mechanisms for coordinationLoose but variable design (typically using sub- frameworks to resolve tension between tightness and scope)A process of iterative alignment (of NQF and practice, intrinsic and institutional logics)Balance of development within sub-frameworks and integration across themPolicy breadth (complementary policies/drivers to change institutional logics).Full Article @Cross-National Differences in Education-Work TransitionShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...« UPDATE – A jobs-centered approach to African American community developmentMigrant Workers | A8 Countries | Great Britain: Overall, have contributed to the growth of the UK economy »DiscussionTrackbacks/PingbacksPingback: Vocational and Technical Education Meet Parent Resistance « Job Market Monitor - July 17, 2012Pingback: German-Style Apprenticeships – Would it Work in the U.S.? « Job Market Monitor - July 21, 2012Pingback: Postsecondary Education and Training Matter « Job Market Monitor - August 16, 2012Pingback: Closing the Skills Gap / Connecting College Students and Employers « Job Market Monitor - November 17, 2012Pingback: Youth Transitions in Europe – Those countries with quicker and more successful school-to-work transitions are those where young people leave home earlier says report | Job Market Monitor - September 11, 2014Pingback: Youth Transitions in Europe – Those countries with quicker and more successful school-to-work transitions are those where young people leave home earlier says report | Job Market Monitor - September 11, 2014Leave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
