Surprisingly, a mistake easier than you might think considering the eerie resemblance of Kutcher to Steve Jobs in the first official picture released today of the 2013 biopic.jOBS will chart the young entrepreneur’s rise to fame, fortune, and fones, and is set to close the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. Sundance 2013 will also play host to Joseph Gordon-Levitt‘s directorial debut, Don Jon’s Addiction, and Amanda Seyfried as porn star Linda Lovelace. Pictures have already been snapped of Kutcher filming in Steve Jobs’ signature outfit: black turtleneck, blue jeans and white trainers, provoking wide-spread excitement and amazed shouts of ‘OHMYGOD, HE LOOKS JUST LIKE HIM!’.WEIRRRRD, HUH?!Rumours have it that a second Steve Jobs biopic, scripted by The Social Network‘s Aaron Sorkin and based on the original biography by Walter Isaacson, is in the Sony pipeline for release in a few years time. So hooray and huzzah, because this means we’ll all have our Steve Jobs fill of technology and 1980s facial hair into the foreseeable future.Whilst we have no doubt that Ashton Kutcher will rise to the challenge, who would you like to see as Steve Jobs in the potential Sorkin/Sony biopic?Previous: Dave Grohl’s Sound City gets first trailerNext: Orange(Wednesday)s and Lemons #95Share this post on:Twitter Facebook Google + PinterestAbout The AuthorImogen O'SullivanTags :Aaron SorkinAmanda SeyfriedAshton KutcherhotteststoryJoseph Gordon-LevittSteve Jobs	Related PostAndy Serkis to direct The Jungle BookDoug Liman in final talks to direct Splinter CellAnderson supercut reveals Wes’ dedication to symmetryMarc Webb will not direct Amazing Spider-Man 4Leave a Reply Cancel replyName *Email *WebsiteSponsored ByRecent CommentsSunburstriv on Au revoir les enfantsMelanie Moment on 10 reasons Disney are unspeakably evilFingerboardyos on Au revoir les enfantsSourneh on Best 5 Scottish Actors and Worst 5 Scottish AccentsK on 10 reasons Disney are unspeakably evilSnipe LondonCoffee chain musical chairs: Black Sheep coffee is taking over and renaming all Taylor Street Baristas; Department of Coffee and Social affairs has bought Taylor Street name from administratorsThe best things to do in London this week, from Art in Whitechapel to Zines in HackneyMet arrests London Assembly member Caroline Russell during anti-shutting-down-of-Parliament protestGrace Dent's review of the new artisan food court below Centrepoint: Food: 5/10 Service: 0/10 Ambience: 0/10Saturday at noon, Downing Street, is the next protest against shutting down ParliamentDesigned By Beke"
