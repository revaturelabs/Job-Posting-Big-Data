(and i am not dissing all my preacher friends at all! i know that being a pastor/minister is incredibly time-consuming, as in a 24 hour a day, 7 day a week job, exhausting, and misunderstood ‚Äì people think all you do is sit around & read and prepare sermons. and mind you, i have never been a senior pastor ‚Äì nor do i want to be!).of course, this does not fulfill my dream of writing full-time, but that is a goal that i have. i know that it is not really possible to just do that right now. so, teaching will also give the opportunity (=time) to grow my blog even more and work on my book, while making more connections in the writing/blogging world.after i processed all of those thoughts (and the knowledge that i just need a job) in about 1 minute, i responded to jessica, ‚ÄúYES!‚Äù. i‚Äôm interested.long story short, i emailed with the director of special education for the county (haywood county ‚Äì where i used to work in the church, the next county over, about 20-30 minutes away), and she said she sent my resume to a principal at a school. and it‚Äôs the school where jessica works! crazy! this was all thursday afternoon, by the way.friday morning, i was cleaning in our studio, when my phone rang. i didn‚Äôt recognize the number and didn‚Äôt think anything about it.me: hello?man on the phone: may i speak to elizabeth?me: (still clueless) this is she.motp: hi. this is ** from ** elementary school. i was just sitting here looking over your resume, and would like to know if you would like to come for an interview on monday.me: (stunned. shocked. confused)oh? (brief pause, because it seemed surreal) absolutely! that soundsgreat!the conversation continued, and we found out we had both lived in the same areas in the middle part of north carolina. and he freaked out when he realized that i worked at a church in canton (same little mountain town) for 7 years, thereby already having a connection with the area. needless to say, it was a very relaxed phone call, and the principal reassured me that the interview would be very relaxed as well.and then, the conversation was over. hang up the phone. stare for a moment. run out of the room to tell lina. call mom. text jessica. update facebook status.i can‚Äôt believe it! i have an interview on monday! woo hoo! wish me luck, send me vibes, and i‚Äôll be sure to keep you posted.looks like that stairway to heaven, to my future, really was a step into the next part of my life. we‚Äôll see what happens. and come what may, i know that it will be exactly as is should be.keep on walking, friends. peace.(Post visit: 14, Today: 1 )Like this:Like Loading...cantoncome what maydaily life in ashevilledowntown ashevilleemploymentfollow your blissfollow your dreamsjob huntingjob interviewjobslife journeymoving to ashevillenetworkingnew jobnew lifeschoolsocial mediastairsstairwayteacherteachingtoday's thoughts.twitterunemploymentwords + thoughtsworkworld coffee	0 Comments	ShareLizLiz is a mystical soul in a modern world.
