The last thing deniers and naysayers ultimate resort to saying \"ah but Tesla is small\". LOL, the numbers we were seeing were really just like Musk said, an exponential growth! Guys like the EverydayAstronaut analyzing the other side of Musk industries, (the rockets) was also literally a blast off after another! Seeing Falcon9 launch so often (and man those landings which were impossible for NASA themselves!) Naysers had to have other reasons than truth.0Steve Jobs boostedDec 30, 2020, 20:52Josué Cortez @[email protected]@stevejobs I must say that Tesla not only has talented people working for them, but also the community of people who are either owners, investors or simply fans are amazing people. I think one of the reasons I barely felt any doubt about Musk and Tesla and the lies against them seemed so obviously blatant was the community itself. People making in depth analysis about the engineering that made the cars work, learning all those detais was really a blast!1Dec 30, 2020, 02:24Steve Jobs @[email protected]Tesla Rolls Out FSD Beta 2020.48.26.1https://wholemars.net/2020/12/29/tesla-rolls-out-fsd-beta-2020-48-26-1/1+Dec 29, 2020, 13:28Steve Jobs @[email protected]Trevor Milton Has Started a New Businesshttps://wholemars.net/2020/12/29/trevor-milton-has-started-a-new-business/b9ca57f9f7dd23dc.png0Dec 29, 2020, 13:23Steve Jobs @[email protected]Tesla CEO Elon Musk Starting to Think about Autonomous Entertainmenthttps://wholemars.net/2020/12/29/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-starting-to-think-about-autonomous-entertainment/0Dec 29, 2020, 07:01Steve Jobs @[email protected]Aaron Greenspan Asks Court to Hand Him Victory by Defaulthttps://wholemars.net/2020/12/28/aaron-greenspan-asks-court-to-hand-him-victory-by-default/d09fe50cd2e9365a.jpeg0Dec 29, 2020, 00:42Steve Jobs @[email protected]Aaron Greenspan Delivers Christmas Day Threathttps://wholemars.net/2020/12/28/aaron-greenspan-delivers-christmas-day-threat/b21ff5fc1ce5d171.jpeg0Steve Jobs boostedDec 26, 2020, 07:35K10 @[email protected]@stevejobs wow, I had phone calls from there.
