All species of sea snake are venomous but not aggressive unless provoked. Although very little is know about these creatures, a lot of species appear on the ICUN Red List. Only one appears on the CITES list, the Laticauda crockeri, listed as vulnerable. The most concerning part of attempts to save sea snakes is that nothing is known of population trends. This means that any efforts to save them cannot be concluded to be successful or otherwise.There are many reasons sea snakes are fished including their meat and their skin. Their skin can be used to many leather products as well as jewellery. It is also thought that their organs are harvested to be used for medical remedies, but not much is known of this practice. It is quite common to see sea snakes being handled as well as skinned and cooked in south-east Asia and India, despite their deadly bite.There are no major efforts on sea snake conservation; I think this may be due to the lack of knowledge about them and their habits. There may be a lack of conservation interest as they are venomous, not very charismatic, and provide economic benefits to the small middle-eastern countries they are found in. In order to make any attempt at preserving these species, local attitudes towards them need to change through education. This can’t be done if we know nothing about them ourselves. We do not know what niche they occupy, or if they have any effect on the underwater world at all. In most species, we do not even know their preferred habitat or even how far down they can dive .Conservationists need to learn more about these creatures before we can save them. Local people need to be educated, but also provided with something to replace that gap in their economy. Maybe if the sea snake was portrayed in a more interesting and charismatic manner, the tourist industry would make up for the loss of revenue from selling the skins for leather. Tourism will pose its own problems, but they can be more easily resolved then wiping a family of fauna from the planet. Sea snakes are interesting and very different from any other animal on the planet.They need to be protected.Tags: red listsnakesBookmark PostPrintLeave a CommentNo comments yet.Leave a CommentYour email address will not be published.*Name*Email*Confirm EmailComment*reCaptchaYou must enable JavaScript to use this form.Tick the box or answer the captcha.You might also likeDisappearing SnakesThanks to long-term data sets, scientists have been able to document the fact that a snake community plummeted following the wipe out of frogs in Panama due to an invasive fungal pathogen.By Alex TaylorWildlife Map Reveals Conservation ConcernsBy producing detailed maps on the distribution of the world’s reptiles, an international team of scientists has completed the ‘atlas of life’, the first global review and map of every vertebrate species on Earth.By Alex TaylorSnakes on a PlaneResearchers have discovered why the brown tree snake has become such a successful invasive species on the island of Guam, where it has devastated native bird populations.By Alex TaylorIndirect Impacts of an Invasive SpeciesThe brown tree snake is an invasive species on Guam, and has exterminated many forest bird species.
