He said he had made it clear that there would be a further stage of income support, and that it was \"disgraceful\" and \"blatantly untrue\" for Labor to claim the government was going to end the program in September. Federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese responded to Morrison’s comments on 12 July by stating that businesses still had no certainty about whether the program will continue, while Labor says figures that reveal there are 13 jobseekers per job vacancy show that the government must keep COVID-19 income support programs in place beyond September.CORPORATESAUSTRALIA.
