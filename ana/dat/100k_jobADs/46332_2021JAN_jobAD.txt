As a few days ago, former finance minister P Chidambaram, citing job growth data, lashed out at the government over sluggish growth. While Piyush Goyal, interim FM, has already given a stern reply to the criticism, Jaitley today replied to the criticism in a strongly-worded blog.“A distinguished predecessor of mine feared that he may have to live his future in poverty. We have enabled every Indian to be a part of the world’s fastest-growing economy. The future looks much brighter than the past. This trend is likely to continue for some years,” he wrote.“An analysis of data clearly shows that the construction sector is expanding by double digits. It is a job-creating sector. Investment is increasing. Domestic investment is also increasing. The FDI is at an unprecedented level. The IBC is unlocking the value in the NPAs,” Jaitley explained.EXCLUSIVE: Piyush Goyal attacks P Chidambaram for leaving economy in 'shambles'He suggested that the structural reforms taken up by this government has largely helped in India’s economic recovery and also said that this government is focused on promoting growth and infrastructure. “We are spending huge amounts on infrastructure creation. Expenditure on rural projects has increased in a big way. The social sector schemes, more particularly the financial inclusion programmes, have created a wave of self-employment. Each one of these is a high job-creating sector,” Jaitley said.“Experts say, the trend of India as the fastest growing global economy is likely to continue for next few years. With structural reforms like demonetisation, implementation of GST & enforcement of the IBC, Indian economy is moving steadily ahead & empowering every citizen,” he said.Other than that, Jaitley also gave a detailed reply to questions regarding the revenue scenario in India. He said, “If this trend continues over the next few years we are looking for a better future. The principal source of income of the Central and the State Governments is tax collection. If India remains a tax non-compliant nation, both Center and State Government will have very little to spend. They will borrow more and spend less.”“Demonetisation, GST, digitisation, AADHAR and the anti-black money measures are leading to the gradual formalisation of the Indian economy. Measures like Foreign Black Money Act, Benami Prohibition Act, Income Disclosure Scheme, changing the tax treaties with Singapore and Mauritius have all yielded rich dividends. Net direct tax collection has seen an unprecedented rise in the last few years. We have now reached 6.86 crore income tax return filers last year,” he added.TAP TO UNMUTERemembering Veteran Leader Arun JaitleyWas Arun Jaitley's death a 'TRP Moment' for Republic TV Founder Arnab Goswami?Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman holds Pre Budget meet; 'welcomes suggestions & viewpoints'Will the Job Market recover as the country recovers from the Pandemic? | The Urban DebateTAP TO UNMUTELive TVSensex Today Jack ma latest news Indigo Paints IPOVIDEOSNifty up at 14,600 points; Markets fare stable today | Buy Now Sell NowTRP scam: Pulwama martyrs’ kin slam Arnab Goswami, demand strict action against himRound 10 of Govt-Kisan talks; Biden-Harris to take oath today | Top NewsWest Bengal: 13 dead in road accident in Jalpaiguri districtBhandara Fire Tragedy: Probe panel submits 50-page report submitted to Health SecretaryJUST INAbsolutely jacked kangaroo photographed by man in AustraliaMumbai: Man attacks wife with acid, gets 3-year jail termNEET 2021 Syllabus Reduced or Not?
