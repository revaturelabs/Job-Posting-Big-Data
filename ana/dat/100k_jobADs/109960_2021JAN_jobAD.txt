When i execute an incremental back up manually it seems to run fine but when i set the scheduler to run every Mon,Tues,Weds,Thurs it gets hung up on a file right at the beginning. I started the incremental backup last night at 10pm and when i came in this morning at 11am it was still at 0%. Also Backup4all would not allow me to cancel the job. I had to physically end the processes from task manager to get it to stop. My Scheduled full backups that run once a week seem to be working fine just the incrementals are failing. We are operating on a server running Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard. Any incite as to why this keeps failing would be greatly appreciated.Also another one of servers is taking two days to do a full backup to a NAS for multiple files equating to 428Gb is this normal?Thank You,Bradley HaynesTopAdrian (Softland)	Posts: 1635Joined: Wed Dec 16, 2009 12:46 pmLocation: Cluj-Napoca, RomaniaContact:Contact Adrian (Softland)WebsiteRe: Scheduled Backup jobs not runningQuotePost by Adrian (Softland) » Thu Oct 27, 2016 8:48 amHi,1.
