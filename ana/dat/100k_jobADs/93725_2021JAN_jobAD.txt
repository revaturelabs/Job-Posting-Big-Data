Xi also expressed that Buddhism should be adapted to the Chinese socialist system so patriotism is prioritised over religion, Tibet Watch said.Sign up for the latest news by emailRecent news & blogs:Tashi Wangchuk, Tibetan language advocate, is expected to be released after five years20th January 2021Tashi WangchukFree Tibet has repeatedly pushed for Tashi’s release after his 2016 detention After five years...Read moreTibetan self-immolation protest revealed after five years of censorship18th January 2021Protests in DriruShurmo’s self-immolation protest in Driru County came to light last week after being censored by CCP...Read moreNew reports highlight dramatic plunge in human rights under the CCP15th January 2021The Chinese flag flying outside the Potala Palace in Lhasa (Xinhua)Free Tibet’s findings feature heavily in Conservative Party report, which calls on UK to re-think relationship with the...Read moreTibetan nomad imprisoned for Dalai Lama posts11th January 2021Lhundup DorjeLhundup was sentenced to one year in prison for social media posts.
