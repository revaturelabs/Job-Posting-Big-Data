We have recently received termination for customer convenience notices for the Nimrod MRA4 and Harrier contracts and this has regrettably led us to initiating consultation regarding potential job losses.“Today’s announcement is designed to ensure we remain competitive as we actively pursue a number of opportunities for our other products and services both in the UK and internationally. Military Air Solutions remains a sustainable business with a strong business plan. I appreciate this is difficult news for our people and we are committed to working with employees and their representatives to explore ways of mitigating the potential job losses.”Notes to Editors:• In addition, as a result of the cancellation of the Nimrod MRA4 programme, the consultation will cover potentially closing the Woodford Site in Cheshire earlier than had been previously announced.• At Chadderton, Prestwick, Yeovil and RAF Kinloss the potential job losses are associated with the cancellation of the Nimrod MRA4 programme.• At Farnborough and RAF Cottesmore the potential job losses are associated with the early withdrawal from service of the Harrier fleet.• At Samlesbury and Warton the potential job losses are associated with both the cancellation for customer convenience of the Nimrod MRA4 programme and the early withdrawal from service of the Harrier fleet.• In addition, BAE Systems Saudi Arabia has today initiated consultation with employee representatives on 90 potential job losses in its UK business, predominantly at Samlesbury. These potential job losses result from the continued realisation of the home market strategy, coupled with our ongoing commitments to Saudisation and Industrialisation in Saudi Arabia.Ref no: 292/2010Issued by:BAE Systems, Farnborough, Hampshire GU14 6YU, UKTel: +44 (0) 1252 384719 Fax: +44 (0) 1252 38394724hr media hotline: + 44 (0) 7801 717739www.baesystems.comRSSPrintLinksAir sectorMultimedia TileView AllAccessibilityTerms & ConditionsPrivacyCookie policySitemapCookie SettingsCopyright © 2021 BAE Systems.
