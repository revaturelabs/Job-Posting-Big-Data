I said it and I meant it.In a recent interview, Kanye admitted that he wants to be the new Steve Jobs of the Gap. Kanye was speaking during the launch of Yeezus season 1.By that he meant that he wants to be the creative brain behind the well-known brand. Admittedly, if that is the case, then Kanye still has a long way before he can match Jobs shoes.However, from what we can see, he is a Steve Jobs in the making given the similarities the two share. It only happens to be in two different spheres, with Kanye making his impact in the Music and fashion industry. Here is why I think Kanye is the new Steve jobs...Kanye + Steve had similar journeysIt has not been a smooth sailing journey to the top for the two. Steve jobs had to face a number of setbacks from the time he founded his first company to his second company and returning to Apple, it was bitter sweet medicine as Steve described it. He got fired along the way, had challenges getting funding and so forth but he still got his way to the top. Kanye’s journey has equally been marred by challenges. His first womenswear wasn’t a success. He got ridiculed and criticized for venturing into unknown waters, but he has still persisted. Kanye like Steve accepted failure and learnt from the experience. Kanye has since started working in a partnership with Adidas which is successful and now the Yeezus season 1 and still soaring high.Kanye just like Jobs is a master of his art.Jobs revolutionized the PC world with the production of apple products. The iPod changed the way people perceived portable music, selling a whopping 350 million plus pieces. Jobs is once noted saying that his major contribution was bringing out liberal arts in the use of computers. Similarly, a lot can be said about Kanye from his Music to fashion design. He puts a lot of effort into his music and works with top talent in the fashion industry to make things happen.Steve and Kanye exhibit passion in their work.Steve is also quoted saying “every good product I have seen is because a group of people cared deeply about making something that they and their friends wanted”, a source from complex.com says. This is a statement that truly revealed his love for what they did at apple. Kanye has equally expressed similar sentiments saying that he aims at creating products that people would love to associate with and own for the rest of their lives. Clearly, money is not the only driving force behind Kanye’s goals, but a desire to touch and solve people lives which is only possible through passion for work.Moral of the Story: Needless to say, success comes with its own challenges. There are those that will love you and those that will hate you. Kanye has also faced his own share of haters through criticism in all sorts of platforms, but whether you like it or not Kanye west is the new Steve jobs.KwameOwner, Springbreak WatchesShare Tweet Pin← Older Post Newer Post →CommentsOrder Discount Direct Fluoxetine Secure Online Cheapeast Reno CHUBRE [url=https://bansocialism.com/]buy cialis online reviews[/url] taidayOptilt precio levitra farmatodoAbentyFet on December 23, 2020Muchas gracias. ?Como puedo iniciar sesion?ifigoccsns on November 07, 2020Leave a commentName EmailMessageSPGBK UpdatesRSSTags10 sites with cool products for men 5 reasons why I started my own business 5 reasons why I started my own company accessories for guys fashion all wood watch apparel for men Beach accessories for men benefits of running your own business benefits of using wood products biodegradable products Bread For Life Day business dreams carbon emissions wood prodcuts chasing your dreams childhood hunger clothes like urban outfitters companies that support earth day 2014 contemporary fashion cool fashion accessories cool fashion accessorries cool products for guys cool products for men cool products for men 2014 cool tech products for men cool websites for men cool wood watches culture design boom Earth Day earth day 2014 eco-friendly Earth DAy Ending Childhood Hunger entrepreneurship environmentally friendly fashion fashion accessories blog fashion accessories tips fashion forward watches Fayetteville North Carolina gear for men hipster hipster fashion how can I rock my wood watch how do I start an ecommerce store how to become more sustainable using wood products how to dress like a hipster How to wear a wood watch independence day 2013 sales july 4th fashion sales keith powers SPGBK Blue Magic Wood watch launching a company online Men's Summer Apparel men's watches online mens style accessories modern fashion natural sustainable watch natural watches new fashion trend new fashion trends for 2013 Outfit ideas for 2013 pretty watches for women products that are biodegradable products that are eco-friendly Retro Jordan 2013 Should I start my own business? sick watches SPGBK Bread For Life Day SPGBK wood watches spring 2014 look book spring break wood watches springbreak blue magic wood watch springbreak watches SpringBreak wood watch Springbreak Wood Watches springbreakwatches.com stylish watches for men Summer 2013 clothing apparel Summer essentials 2013 sustainability 2014 sustainable business sustainable fashion sustainable products for earth day Top 5 Men's Accessories top 5 watches in 2013 Urban men's watches urban outfitters watches 2013 watch look book watches for men brands Why should I start an ecommerce store why should I start my own business why use wood products why you should chase your dreams wood accessories for men wood stores carbon emissions wood sunglasses wood sustainable products wood watch wood watches wood watches 2013 wooden watchesSPGBK Influencer: Kehaulani J.
