The quality which brings joy, pleasure, excitement, amusement, experience, knowledge, money, luxuries, travelling, respect and fame. We are living in an era of Technology and we all have the desires to get our goals in just a little jump with short spell of time. Some of us are fortunate to have such opportunity but majority needs to put their own effort and we all know that the outcomes could only be possible if you get success as an employee in International market.Before thinking to transit abroad, first we need to analyze our intentions. Whether we only want a job? Or also want to explore the world? To increase our capability as having a tag of International job? Or interested in cultures of others while communicating with them during stay period. I am discussing few of the major factors which will assist you for moving abroad with a good job:1: Strategic Job SearchThe first and most prime requirement for getting a job is to work on strategy to be followed, otherwise, you will mess up having zero result. The Strategic plan comprises of:Field of interestSource of getting informationNewspaper, websites, blogs, adds, social networksPersonal contactsGeographical analysis, search the list of country having high ratio of employmentYour language proficiency for that particular region2: Pursue Focused ObjectivesThe failure came when we consume the energy on diverse plan instead of the core focus. Try to follow the targeted search as per your academics, your skills or your interest. We have come to know our strengths, our aims and the point of weaknesses from previous job. The proficiency and skills gained during any other activity besides job are the plus points for job searching in addition to the main course. You may take the advices of any expert counselor in this regard.3: Global SearchSearch the Global market first. You need to find the answers of below queries:Are you capable of moving abroad?Having the academics which meet the International standards?What’s the global importance of the country you are applying for?Influence of locals and multinational companies in that specific regions.Job designations and job titlesSalary scale/package and work requirements4: Sophistication GloryIt’s a time to polish the skills which you already have, to overcome on the flaws and failures experienced during the previous job or academics, improve your language proficiency as this is the very necessitating factor for existence and survival in outside from your Native land. Increase your technical knowledge as well. Try to build adaptability to the maximum level, as the one who will survive is not the most intelligent or strongest rather it is one who can manage and accept the changes quickly.5: Communication PortfolioThe utmost area of importance is your correspondence with the searched offices, their HR teams and their online CVs Analyzers. Any job/interview calls only came if the CV and cover letter has some very eye catching skills, the clear objectives and the relation of your academics with the job which you are applying for. There are lots of sample CVs and cover letters in different global websites where you can also seek the advices of online available student/career advisors.6: Use of ReferencesThe one easy to approach source for job seeking is the presence of your friends, colleagues, alumni, supervisors and other personal contacts. This kind of source may not be involved directly in your job searching but they may assist you in various ways as by informing you about any vacancy in their own company. They can give your introduction in their circle and guide you about the language and other necessary details.7: Exposure to InterviewNow it’s a time to get ready yourself for an International interview. Keeping in mind all of the means of giving interview (via phone call, social networks, video calling etc.), you should be aware to answer the questions with full confidence, presence of mind and tactfulness. Do not elongate the sentences, don’t go deep and do not mix one answer with other. Always answer on same medium in which the question is asked.8: Expenses to OccurKeeping the amount of around 4-6 months expenses is the very important point. In addition, the contact with references immediately after the arrival is also very necessary.Final WordsAt the end note and to sum up the whole session, we can say that Job searching and moving from one land to other is not a one day activity. It’s a planned and wise decision of your life as you are always given at least “One Chance” and if you could avail that chance, you would become a successful individual.Author BioKatherine Brunt is a career counselor with her huge experience of working in this field.
