We also have reports that at the conclusion of the interview, the victim is requested to eithersend a deposit via check as an “application fee” orgive their bank login credentials in order to “set up direct deposit.”To those of you who are actively job searching, please take extra precautions to be sure you are not a victim of one of these scams.Here are some signs to look out for:Unprofessional language typically used in scams.“Work-at-home,” “work-from-home,” “quick money” are phrases that tend to come up in scams to make you more likely to apply.A professionally written job offer typically uses phrases like “remote work” or “telecommuting” to describe these positions.The employer is seeking to hire immediately or wants your reply urgently.The hiring process is typically lengthy and involved.Job offers that ask you to download a specific app to communicate with them or do not follow up with a phone interview.It is practically never the case that you will be hired for a position without meeting a manager or a representative first either by phone, video call or in-person.Job offers from generic email addresses like from Gmail and Yahoo.Although some companies do conduct their business with personal accounts, most companies can easily obtain an official company domain to conduct their business.Give job offers from personal email accounts a second glance before replying. Do background research on the company first, for example, check if they have a website or a Human Resources department you can reach out to.Job offers that include application fees up front without a justification.Never agree to send money, or perform a financial transaction on a company’s behalf.A recruiter who asks you for your bank account login information when setting up direct deposit.No one should ever ask you for your login information. Direct deposit can be accomplished with simply your bank account and routing number. If someone asks for your password to any of your accounts (especially financial ones), you are most likely dealing with a scammer.If it sounds too good to be true, it’s probably a scam.If you have any questions about these scams, or you believe you are a victim of one, please feel free to contact our Information Security Team at abuse@adelphi.edu for guidance.Recommended ReadingIndeed – Guidelines for Safe Job SearchIndeed – I May Have Been Scammed, What Can I Do?Forbes – Job Hunting Scams Amid COVID-19 PandemicSecurity Boulevard – COVID-19 Phishing Update: Money Mule Scams Use Remote Opportunities to Entice VictimsChicago Tribune – People job searching during coronavirus stay-at-home orders can be more vulnerable to employment scamsFor further information, please contact:Todd WilsonStrategic Communications Directorp – 516.237.8634e – twilson@adelphi.eduOpen site alertUtility NavigationApply NowPlan a VisitGive NowAdelphi UniversityOne South Avenue | P.O.
