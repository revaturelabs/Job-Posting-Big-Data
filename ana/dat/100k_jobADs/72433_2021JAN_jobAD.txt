As COVID continues surging to record highs, causing increasingly strict economic shutdowns, jobless claims disappointed for a second consecutive week and totaled 885,000-their highest levels since early September. This was also significantly worse than consensus estimates of 808,000. However, markets rose amid increasing signs that point to a stimulus deal coming soon. After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, “I’m optimistic that we’re gonna be able to complete an understanding sometime soon,” the reality on the ground seemed to reflect this. Congress is inching closer towards a $900 billion stimulus package that would include a new round of direct payments to Americans. However, that package would exclude liability protections for businesses and state and local aid- two contentious areas of partisan divide. On this stimulus news, the Dow Jones climbed 135 points, or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq NDAQ also both gained 0.5% and hit intraday record highs. The Nasdaq also closed at another record high yesterday. Utilities and materials were the best-performing sectors in the S&P 500, rising more than 1% each, while Apple AAPL rose nearly 1% to lead the Dow higher.
