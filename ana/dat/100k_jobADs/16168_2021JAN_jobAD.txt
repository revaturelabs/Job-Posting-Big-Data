IMPROVE YOUR CVUnderstand that your CV is a MARKETING document – you want the reader to think you are awesomeRecognise that you are being hired to SOLVE A PROBLEM for the employer – so you want to show what you can do for the employer – how you will benefit him/her and the organization - how you can help improve profits (a Superstar) and/or reduce costs and just make things run better (a Hero).Put yourself in the shoes of the reader – whoever is reading your cv is probably going to skim over it so KEEP IT SIMPLE. No need to write an autobiography with lots of long paragraphsFocus on your ACHIEVEMENTS AND BENEFITS – what did you succeed in doing in your prior roles and how did those achievements benefit the organisationUnderstand that firms now use A.I. tools to screen CVs so you got to have the right KEY WORDS. 75% of CVS are rejected because they don’t have certain key words2. DEVELOP YOUR LINKEDIN PROFILEYour LinkedIn profile is also another marketing tool and needs to be treated as such.Be sure that any potential employer is going to check your profile on LinkedIn, not to mention the scores of recruiters who spend their entire day looking at profiles on LinkedIn. You need to stand out and attract attention and make it easy for firms / recruiters to find you.Have a clear professional photoHave a strap line description that attracts attentionThe “About You” section should focus on how you can solve other people’s pain points and how you can add valuePost content and comment on other people’s postsMake sure your LinkedIn profile aligns with your CV – potential hiring managers will cross referenceAsk for endorsements and recommendations from people3. BUILD YOUR NETWORKThe old saying “it’s who you know, not what you know” is as true as ever. The more well connected you are, the better your chances are for increasing your mobility.Most people only think about networking when they need to find a job but you need to think that networking is in fact part of your job and something you always need to be doing.In the office – don’t just stick to your immediate team but build relationships with as many stakeholders you are. The more VISIBLE you are in your workplace the higher your chances are to get promotedGet to KNOW YOUR PEERS – reach out to those who do a similar job at another firm and share ideas/experiences. They will appreciate it as much as you wouldTHINK DIVERSITY – look to people outside your immediate bubble to build relationships with. Opportunities can come from the least obvious places so have an open mind4. SHAPE YOUR PERSONAL BRANDINGEvery famous person you know cultivates their personal brand, so why shouldn’t you?Identify your VALUE PROPOSITION – what do you stand for? who are you? what value do you bring that employers will be interested in? If you don’t know what you stand for and if you can’t articulate this, then how can you expect others to get it.Recognise that those who stand out are more likely to progress in their careerGET COMFORTABLE WITH PUBLIC SPEAKING . Seek out opportunities to hone that skillset. Warren Buffet has said that the single most important skillset anyone can acquire is mastering the art of public speakingYOU ARE WHO GOOGLE SAYS YOU ARE. Have a positive social media profile. Write a blog, write posts on LinkedIn, start a podcast, post video. Content is king and a great way to get noticed. The more visible you are, the more Google will like you.5. WORK ON YOUR MINDSETBe prepared for failure and ready for success - having the right mindset is key to a successful career as well as a successful life. Without the right attitude, you will always be on the wrong side of life.BE PERSISTENT – you never know how close you might be to success so never give up.There is no secret to success - Success is simply having a well thought out plan, coupled with intelligently applied hard work and dedication.Creating a positive mindsetBe objectiveChoose to see the good in situationsPut things in perspectiveRevert to the present momentYou are in control of your own destiny so focus on what you can control15 views0 commentsRecent PostsSee AllThe Weekly ETF Roundup: w/e January 22, 2021 – Will Water be the Next Big Thing in Thematics?300The Weekly ETF Roundup: w/e January 15, 2021 – Tabula Enters the ESG Arena190The Weekly ETF Roundup: w/e January 8, 2021 – Thematic ETFs Growth Set to Continue in 2021510Subscribe©2020 Blackwater Search.
