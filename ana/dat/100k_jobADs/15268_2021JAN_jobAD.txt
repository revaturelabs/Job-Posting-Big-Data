This model is much easier to accept when we look at all the facts contained in the geological column. It takes more faith to believe in evolution than it does to believe the Bible. And Born Again Christians will tell you that, according to God’s Word the NEXT Judgement of God will be one of a World-Wide Fire – 2 Peter 3 ! And we have no reason to doubt the truth of God’s Word, the Bible.
