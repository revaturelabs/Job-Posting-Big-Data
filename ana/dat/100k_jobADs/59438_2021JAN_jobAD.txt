Gigantic and painstaking, scrupulous and titanic efforts were required in order to deploy the Maidan, to keep it, to keep hungry [people] on the street in the cold.DisproofA recurring pro-Kremlin narrative that claims the Euromaidan was a coup sponsored by the US.The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was a reaction from several segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013, after pressure from Russia. See the full debunk, The Western-backed coup in Ukraine has torn the country asunder.See similar disinformation cases alleging that a civil war began in Ukraine after the clique seized power in the country, that Euromaidan was an armed coup that resulted in an illegitimate transit of power, that after Euromaidan Ukraine lost its sovereignty and is falling apart, or that the aim of the coup in Ukraine in 2013-2014 was to seize Ukraine's resources.Go to searchFacebook Twitter CopyGo to searchpublication/mediaantifashist.online (Archived)antimaydan.info (Archived)Reported in: Issue 225DATE OF PUBLICATION: 30/11/2020Language/target audience: RussianCountry: Ukraine, USKeywords: Colour revolutions, Coup, EuromaidanDisclaimerCases in the EUvsDisinfo database focus on messages in the international information space that are identified as providing a partial, distorted, or false depiction of reality and spread key pro-Kremlin messages.

It is a club against any Ukrainian politician, official, or businessman who dares to be arbitrary (i.e. go beyond the limits set by the system of external control).December 14, 2020DisproofThis is an example of a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative alleging that Ukraine is under external control.NABU is a state law enforcement agency that independently investigates the corruption of public officials and prepares cases for prosecution. The bureau was created in 2014 after the National Anti-Corruption Committee did not fulfil its obligations. NABU is accountable to the Parliament of Ukraine through the law on the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and the law on prevention of corruption.International Criminal Court demonises Russia in the Ukrainian conflictThe prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is trying not only to make Russia a participant in the conflict but also to impose on Russia the duties of an “occupying power” both in relation to Crimea (she directly writes: “Russia’s annexation of Crimea”) and in relation to the eastern regions of Ukraine.The prosecutor fulfils an order for the legal demonisation of Russia in the Ukrainian conflict. And she does it legally so rudely that there is no doubt about the unscrupulous nature of her actions.The individuals who committed a coup d’etat in the country and used violence against a part of their own population are regarded in The Hague as legitimate authority!December 14, 2020DisproofThis is an example of recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation on Ukraine and, in particular, the examination by the International Criminal Court of the crimes committed in Ukraine during the 2013-2014 protests in Crimea and Donbas.The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) did not demonise Russia. The Prosecutor did not call Russia an occupying power in Crimea or Donbas. In the statement, the Prosecutor mentioned that in order to establish the truth, the ICC is going to cooperate with the authorities of Ukraine and Russia equally.The West tacitly admits that Crimea belongs to Russia, as proven by firms operating thereWestern firms are slowly entering Crimea, and sanctions are no obstacle. The situation of Austrian architects Coop Himmelblau, which took part in the construction of the Sevastopol Opera, only showed that the West has adopted for a long time the tacit consent that Crimea belongs to Russia after the peninsula was reunited with the country in 2014 amidst a coup in Kyiv and following a referendum. Western countries, along with Ukraine, don’t recognise Crimea as Russian, but this can’t be said of the business community.December 14, 2020DisproofRecurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the 2013-14 protests in Ukraine and the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia.Contrary to the claim, international sanctions over Crimea are a serious obstacle for Western firms to operate on the peninsula. Those companies who continue doing it are forced to resort to complicated evasive schemes and face consequences of violating EU legislation.don't be deceived, question even moreShare your feedback with usFIRST NAMELAST NAMEEMAIL ADDRESSCOMMENTSend FeedbackDISCLAIMERCases in the EUvsDisinfo database focus on messages in the international information space that are identified as providing a partial, distorted, or false depiction of reality and spread key pro-Kremlin messages.
