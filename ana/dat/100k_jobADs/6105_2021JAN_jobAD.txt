Should you pursue higher education?A Master's degree program or any post-graduate program in Cook Islands costs anywhere from 23,500 New Zealand Dollar(s) to 70,600 New Zealand Dollar(s) and lasts approximately two years. That is quite an investment.You can't really expect any salary increases during the study period, assuming you already have a job. In most cases, a salary review is conducted once education is completed and the degree has been attained.Many people pursue higher education as a tactic to switch into a higher paying job. The numbers seem to support this tactic. The average increase in compensation while changing jobs is approximately 10% more than the customary salary increment.The decision really depends on your situation and experience among many other factors. Putting all variables aside, if you can afford the costs of higher education then the return on investment is definitely worth it.

The people who get the highest bonuses are usually somehow involved in the revenue generation cycle.64% of surveyed staff in Information Technology reported that they haven't received any bonuses or incentives in the previous year while 36% said that they received at least one form of monetary bonus.Those who got bonuses reported rates ranging from 3% to 6% of their annual salary.Received Bonus36%No Bonus64%Types of Bonuses ConsideredIndividual Performance-Based BonusesThe most standard form of bonus where the employee is awarded based on their exceptional performance.Company Performance BonusesOccasionally, some companies like to celebrate excess earnings and profits with their staff collectively in the form of bonuses that are granted to everyone. The amount of the bonus will probably be different from person to person depending on their role within the organization.Goal-Based BonusesGranted upon achieving an important goal or milestone.Holiday / End of Year BonusesThese types of bonuses are given without a reason and usually resemble an appreciation token.Bonuses Are Not Commissions!People tend to confuse bonuses with commissions. A commission is a prefixed rate at which someone gets paid for items sold or deals completed while a bonus is in most cases arbitrary and unplanned.What makes a position worthy of good bonuses and a high salary?The main two types of jobsRevenue Generators Supporting CastEmployees that are directly involved in generating revenue or profit for the organization. Their field of expertise usually matches the type of business.Employees that support and facilitate the work of revenue generators. Their expertise is usually different from that of the core business operations.Example:A graphics designer working for a graphics designing company.Example:A graphic designer in the marketing department of a hospital.Revenue generators usually get more and higher bonuses, higher salaries, and more frequent salary increments. The reason is quite simple: it is easier to quantify your value to the company in monetary terms when you participate in revenue generation.“Try to work for companies where your skills can generate revenue. We can't all generate revenue and that's perfectly fine.”Bonus Comparison by Seniority LevelTop management personnel and senior employees naturally exhibit higher bonus rates and frequencies than juniors. This is very predictable due to the inherent responsibilities of being higher in the hierarchy. People in top positions can easily get double or triple bonus rates than employees down the pyramid.21 High Paying Jobs That Don't Require a College Degree!Check The ListSalaries for specific divisions in Information TechnologyData AnalysisDatabase AdministrationDevelopers and ProgrammersIT AdministrationIT ConsultancyIT HelpdeskIT ManagementIT SecurityNetworkingOther ITWeb / InternetInformation Technology Hourly Average Wage in Cook Islands27 NZD per hourThe average hourly wage (pay per hour) in Cook Islands is 27 NZD.
