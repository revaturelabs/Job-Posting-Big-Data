Does my home really need insulation? Will it make a difference in my bill?Greenbanc takes the guesswork out of the process by relying on the Department of Energy’s Home Energy Score and its objective science-based methodology for analyzing your home’s energy efficiency. Your home’s score and suggestions come directly from the Department of Energy’s model and reflect the millions of dollars the government has invested in research and development to determine projects that have attractive returns.Greenbanc acts as the homeowner’s advocate in the second step of the process: selecting contractors. Greenbanc’s Greenjobs platform allows homeowners to receive bids from multiple contractors and solar installers to do the work. This drives down the cost and assures you that you are getting great value and maximizing savings. We aim to make the process easy, transparent and efficient with the highest possible savings in the industry. There’s no obligation to do the work and your personal information remains confidential, except to the contractors or installers you select.Additionally, the service is free for homeowners.Greenjobs is currently in alpha trials (with some manual fine-tuning).
