Our proprietary machine-learning algorithm uses more than 600,000 data points to make its predictions. To get the most accurate prediction of the salary you might earn, customize the prediction in your Dice profile. Actual salary offered by employer may vary.How was this salary estimate calculated?Dice's predictive salary model is a proprietary machine-learning algorithm. Unlike many other salary tools that require a critical mass of reported salaries for a given combination of job title, location and experience, the Dice model can make accurate predictions on even uncommon combinations of job factors. The model does this by recognizing patterns in the more than 600,000 salary data points to infer how much each factor - job title, location, experience, education, and skills - will impact the salary.Have more questions?
