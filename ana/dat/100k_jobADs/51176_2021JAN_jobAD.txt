He blamed several factors, including the economy, terrorism and the resulting decision by other conventions to move their dates closer to ARMA’s.Several exhibitors had promised to take part, then backed out after Sept. 11.Fiola, who owns cabinetry supplier Studio Technology, will still lose money on the event because he had signed a contract with a hotel in Burlington, Mass.“I really still believe (ARMA) is a viable organization but obviously I can’t continue to pay all the money and take losses if there’s no support from the industry,” Fiola said. “I can’t have the same nine or 10 companies show up and having it cost Studio Technology money.”Fiola still plans to hold an ARMA event in the middle Atlantic states next year, and said a winter show in Atlanta is being considered.“It may just be the state of the world right now, and the industry as well,” he said.SubscribeFor more stories like this, and to keep up to date with all our market leading news, features and analysis, sign up to our newsletter here.RelatedProgramming and SalesKojo Nnamdi Show to End in AprilWAMU announces plan to end productionHeadlines2021 Celebration of Service Nominations OpenNAB Leadership Foundation sets deadline for March 5Programming and SalesHow WTOP Covered the Assault on CongressRadio journalists use smartphones and WhatsApp to get the story to listenersBusiness and LawHybrid Radio and the Royalties QuestionAdvocates seek to minimize the exposure of stations to higher costsGuest CommentariesCommunity Broadcaster: Making Sense of ChaosWhat can a small community radio broadcaster do when breaking news is the priority?HeadlinesFCC to Host Summit on Finding Jobs in the Tech SectorThe Road Map to Tech Jobs event is set for January 15ProductsMSA Recalls Some of Its LifelinesHere's how to determine if your climber has oneHeadlinesPower Up Hybrid Radio With RadioDNSLearn new tech and save money by doing it yourselfFrom the EditorJason Ornellas Makes His MarkOur Excellence in Engineering recipient “will go through walls to get things done”About UsContact UsTagsAdvertisePrivacy PolicyCalifornia Privacy RightsTerms of UseAd ChoicesSubscribePrivacy SettingsAccessibility Statement© 2021 Future Publishing Limited, Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA.
