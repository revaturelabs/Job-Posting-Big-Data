"New Year, New Job â€“ ryanguard.netSkip to contentryanguard.netRyan GuardNew Year, New JobI should probably start by saying that I am still the High School Pastor at Mission. Thereâ€™s no plan to change that. Iâ€™ll still be the primary communicator/leader/vision caster/etc.What will change is that I will also be the College Pastor at Mission starting this January! Iâ€™m ridiculously excited about this!Iâ€™m handing off a ton of my High School Ministry workload to our HSM director Jonny Lutz, and heâ€™s going to hand off a ton of his workload to a brand new coordinator that weâ€™re hiring. Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m allowed to say who that coordinator is yet, so youâ€™ll have to wait.I have a huge heart for college students, and Iâ€™m going to be able to spend a ton of time focusing on the College Ministry. The former pastor in the ministry (Jason Robinson) has done an incredible job at leading the ministry for the past five years, and I consider it a tremendous honor to take the reins from him.Hereâ€™s to 2014!May God get all the glory ðŸ™‚Tweet this:ShareTwitterLike this:Like Loading...RelatedAuthor ryanguardPosted on December 30, 2013 Categories Uncategorized	Leave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
