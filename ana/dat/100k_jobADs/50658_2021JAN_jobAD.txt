Labelled as the ‘Empowering Communities’ initiative, it aims to:Create jobs and offer training for those that are unemployed or homelessWork with residents to identify and support community projectsHelp young people to develop new science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills and access apprenticeshipsBuild a sustainable legacy, continuing to benefit even after work is completedOthers that are also involved in the scheme include HS2 LTD and its contractors such as Costain, Skanska, STRABAG, Mace Dragados and Arup. With Network Rail now involved, this can help all partners better reach local communities in the seven boroughs along the London section of the HS2 route.Speaking on the initiative, James Dean, Network Rail West Coast South route director, said: “We are delighted to be collaborating with industry partners to create opportunities for people in the local area. Euston station sits in the heart of Camden, as well as serving tens of thousands of passengers a day we offer great jobs and training.“We’re going to put significant people power behind this social legacy project. Everybody at Network Rail gets five days volunteer leave. I hope we can use those days to make a real difference”Louise Dailly, chair of the Empowering Communities steering group and head of social sustainability, at Skanska Costain STRABAG joint venture, said: “We’re delighted Network Rail has joined the Empowering Communities partnership.The programme brings together the strengths of the partner organisations and enables us to deliver more together than we could individually.She continued:“This collaborative approach will boost opportunities for local people and deliver long-lasting benefits in terms of tackling worklessness, homelessness and providing opportunities for local young people, businesses and community projects.”The seven London boroughs who will benefit from the new scheme are: Brent, Camden, Ealing, Hammersmith & Fulham, Hillingdon, Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea, and Westminster.Morson is the UK's leading rail recruiter, working on some of the biggest rail projects.
