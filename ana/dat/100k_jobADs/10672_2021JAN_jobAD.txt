Customers will get better choice, better value, more convenience and more personalisation.“Retailing will be more productive, powered by better jobs that offer the chance to develop a wide array of skills and greater earnings. Not because of the National Living Wage, but because differentiation between competing retailers will depend on it”.Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said: “The combination of price deflation, business rate rises, and growing labour costs is putting increasing pressure on a highly competitive sector which is already going through a time of great change.“In order to minimise the impact on retail jobs across the country, we need to work in collaboration with government and other key stakeholders to ensure there is a considered response to this structural change.“Getting this response right will have a positive impact on the retail industry, but also on the wider economy, social mobility, geographical balance, training and employment more broadly”.Source: British Retail Consortiumwww.brc.org.uk29 February 2016Related NewsFootfall Dropped By More Than 40% During 202011 January 2021BRC Responds To Lockdown Announcement05 January 2021BRC: Response To Tier 4 Restrictions And French Border Closure21 December 2020view more UK DIY NewsInsight provides a host of information I need on many of our company’s largest customers.
