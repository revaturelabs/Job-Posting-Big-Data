Break away from work and turn to the water to relax and energize your spirit. The moment you step on your board you will find yourself in a completely different world. It doesn't matter where or when you go. Discover the Jobe SUP collection now. Jobe produces the best value and most advanced construction along with the most complete packages.Aero SUP CollectionWhen you don't live close to the water an inflatable paddle board is just way more convenient than a hardshell board like the Jobe bamboo and titan boards. Everything fits into one small waterproof backpack, which makes it easy to take it with you anywhere you go. Jobe inflatable boards are the lightest and stiffest on the market and... they offer a 3 year warranty on all of the Aero boards.Best Board EverStiffer and more lightweight than ever. Heat Bonded Technology.As Jobe had no interest in producing single layer boards, they took a layer of drop stitch reinforcement to protect the base cloth and a second drop stitch reinforcement layer to strengthen the board to the max. The Heat Bonded Technology holds that they use to laminate the drop stitch inside to the second layers with controlled heat performed by a machine, removing all human error and flaws. On top of these layers, they use a PVC-coat stringer to guarantee the Aero its durability. All layers are well-connected due to thermos-assembled methods performed by high-tech machines under controlled conditions, saving almost 2kg in weight compared to traditional double layer application methods. The stringer make the board stiffer and way more durable and therefore safer, than cheap one layer boards.Jobe Aero SUP Boards Size GuideDesna 10.0 Yarra 10.6 Duna 11.6 Neva 12.6Length 10' / 305cm 10'6\" / 320cm 11'6\" / 350cm 12' 6\" / 381cmWidth 32\" / 81.3cm 32\" / 81.3cm 31\" / 78.7cm 30\" / 76.2cmThickness 4\" / 10cm 6\" / 15cm 6\" / 15cm 6\" / 15cmVolume 200ltrs 310ltrs 324ltrs 320ltrsBoard Weight 17.2lbs / 7.8kg 18.5lbs / 8.4kg 18.7lbs / 8.5kg 20lbs / 9.1kgNose Flat Flat Flat FlatCentre Flat Flat Flat FlatTail Flat Flat Flat FlatNose Rocker 7.5\" 9\" 9\" 9\"Tail Rocker 0\" 0\" 0\" 0\"Max Rider Weight 198lbs / 90kgs 265lbs / 120kgs 265lbs / 120kgs 265lbs / 120kgsFin Set Up Three 4.2\" flexible fins Centre fin with handscrew Centre fin with handscrew Centre fin with handscrewCategory Allround Allround Allround / Touring TouringIntended Place to Use Lake / River / Urban Lake / River / Urban Lake / River / Urban Lake / River / UrbanCare3 Years WarrantyWe believe in our brand.
