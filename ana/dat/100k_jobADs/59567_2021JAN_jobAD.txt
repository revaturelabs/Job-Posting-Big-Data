Estimators may travel to worksites, read blueprints and technical documents, collaborate with engineers and other high-level personnel, or consult construction experts in order to gather data regarding materials, labor, and time needed to complete the project. They analyze this information to calculate reasonable cost-effective budgets and probable project timelines. Strong computer skills are important, as most estimates are determined using programs.Estimators produce output for several purposes. Some focus on specific parts of a larger project, such as the time needed for a particular phase or cost of plumbing. Others compile these focused assessments into general estimates for the entire project. Still others might coordinate with sales teams to use their calculations to plan and deliver bids to clients.Search Estimator JobsAll Assistant Project Manager Assistant Superintendent Contract Administrator Division / Regional President Drafting / CAD Estimator Finance / Accounting Foreman / Supervisor Inspector Land Acquisition Marketing Planner / Scheduler President / CEO Project Manager / Construction Manager Purchasing Quality Assurance / Quality Control Safety Sales Superintendent Surveyor VP Construction Architect Civil Engineer Construction / Project Engineer - Other Electrical Engineer Geotechnical Engineer Mechanical Engineer Carpenter Carpet Installer Ceiling Tile Installer and Acoustical Carpenter Concrete and Terrazzo Finisher (Concrete Mason & Finisher) Controls / Telephone / Alarm / Cable Installer Drywall (Installer,Taper, Lather) Electrician Elevator Installer & Repairer Fence Erector Floor Layer (Except Carpet, Wood, and Hard Tile) Glazier Hard Tile Setter Hazardous Materials Removal Worker Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning Mechanic Heavy Equipment Operator (including Paver, Pile Driver) Insulation Worker Laborer Mason (Brick, Stone, Block) Millwright / Mechanic / Maintenance Painter and Paperhanger (construction and maintenance) Plasterer and Stucco Mason Plumber, Pipefitter, Pipelayer, and Steamfitter Reinforcing Metal Worker Roofer Sheet Metal (including Duct Installer) Structural Metal Worker Welder / Fabricator1-12 of 12 JobsTake-Off Technician Estimator Trainee - Or Entry Level - Career MindedPro Spec Painting Incorporated - Vineland, NJJob Information Pro-Spec Painting Inc Take-Off Technician Estimator Trainee - Experienced or Entry Level - Career Minded in Vineland, New Jersey Full-time, Part-time, Temporary, Internship Take-Off...2 days agoConcrete EstimatorDeptford, NJ (24 miles from Vineland, NJ)An award winning and recognized Concrete Contractor with a reputation for excellence in building is seeking an experienced Estimator With Heavy Civil to oversee diverse projects from pre-construction...2 days agoConcrete EstimatorGPAC - Woodbury, NJ (24 miles from Vineland, NJ)An award winning and recognized Concrete Contractor with a reputation for excellence in building is seeking an experienced Estimator With Heavy Civil to oversee diverse projects from pre-construction...4 days agoCommercial Cabinet EstimatorMay Cabinets Inc - Glassboro, NJ (16 miles from Vineland, NJ)Web link: Link Description: May Cabinets is seeking a Cabinet and Millwork Estimator for commercial projects....5 days agoConstruction EstimatorRosenhayn, NJ (8 miles from Vineland, NJ)ATT: Construction Estimator Position...6 days agoCabinet/Millwork EstimatorGlassboro, NJ (16 miles from Vineland, NJ)May Cabinets is seeking a Cabinet and Millwork Estimator for commercial projects....7 days agoMechnical EstimatorLiberty Personnel - Millville, NJ (11 miles from Vineland, NJ)Mechanical construction, mechanical contracting, estimator, estimating, estimate, HVAC, Plumbing, piping, construction management, facilities, take offs, bids, change orders, Sales, Estimator, Estimating...13 days agoMechanical Estimator (HVAC)Liberty Personnel - Somerdale, NJ (24 miles from Vineland, NJ)Performs estimating process daily, including take-offs, obtaining quotations from subcontractors & suppliers Preparing the proposal and other bid return documentation....21 days agoProject Manager- Estimator- Civil ConstructionLiberty Personnel - Deptford, NJ (24 miles from Vineland, NJ)Responsibilities included but not limited to: Ensure bids, estimates, budgets and jobs are timely Perform quantity take-offs and turnkey estimates for heavy construction projects (Heavy/Highway, Heavy...45+ days agoMechanical EstimatorLiberty Personnel - Glassboro, NJ (16 miles from Vineland, NJ)Mechanical construction, mechanical contracting, estimator, estimating, estimate, HVAC, Plumbing, piping, construction management, facilities, take offs, bids, change orders, Sales, Estimator, Estimating...45+ days agoEstimator (Store)84 Lumber Company - Sewell, NJ (20 miles from Vineland, NJ)The Multi-Family Estimator is responsible for estimating for type 3 and type 5 construction for wood frame multi-story buildings....60+ days agoConstruction Estimator/PMLiberty Personnel - Woodbury, NJ (24 miles from Vineland, NJ)Qualified Candidates must have: Knowledge and Experience in Commercial Construction Preparing labor and material estimates based on architectural drawings Quantity take-offs and the review of subcontractor...90+ days agoView all jobsDemographic Data for Vineland, NJMoving to Vineland, NJ?
