Americans Can’t Afford Faux Meat Now.ByAl RootMay 1, 2020 10:42 am ETOrder ReprintsPrint ArticleText sizePhotograph by Photo by Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty ImagesWells Fargo is recommending that its clients sell Beyond Meat shares because the highflying alternative-meat startup isn’t safe from the Covid-19 pandemic.Analyst John Baumgartner downgraded Beyond Meat (ticker: BYND) stock from the equivalent of Hold to Sell on Friday. “Our more cautious stance is driven by expectations for much softer food service demand in 2020 and sharply eroding economic conditions that risk demand for premium-priced plant-based meat at retail,” wrote BaumgartnerIn other words, plant-based meat is pricey, and people aren’t eating out because most restaurants are closed.A couple of Beyond Burger patties, for instance, can cost about $12 a pound, roughly twice what ground beef costs shoppers. Beyond management, of course, realizes this and is working to get the cost of its products down.“We continue to expect that [profit margin] will be delivered primarily through improved volume leverage, greater internalization of our manufacturing footprint, materials and packaging input cost reductions, tolling fee efficiencies and improved supply chain logistics and distribution costs,” said CFO Mark Nelson on the company’s recent earnings conference call.“As we have stated previously, over time, we intend to pass some of these cost savings on to the consumer as we pursue our goal to achieve price parity with animal protein in at least in one of our product categories by 2024.”Still, pricey isn’t great when more than 30 million American’s have filed initial claims for unemployment benefits over the past few weeks. Unemployment is rapidly approaching 20%.Of course, plant-based meat is better than no meat at all. Protein companies, including Tyson Foods (TSN), have said the U.S. is likely to face meat shortages because the industry is having a hard time keeping processing plants open. Higher meat prices, or reduced supply, would help Beyond in the grocery story, but Wells Fargo is also concerned about food-service sales.Restaurants and other prepared-food outlets account for about half of Beyond’s sales. And people aren’t eating out during the pandemic. Baumgartner acknowledges that sales at retail are jumping, but not enough to justify the stock’s recent levels.In the end, he struggles with valuation. The stock trades for about 170 times estimated 2021 earnings and 10 times 2021 estimated sales. The company, of course, is a fast-growing startup, making comparisons with peers difficult.In his note downgrading the stock, Baumgartner left his price target unchanged at $72 a share. Beyond shares have raced past that mark in recent weeks, bringing the year-to-date gain to more than 30% as of Thursday’s closing price. The S&P 500 is down by double digits.Baumgartner isn’t alone in his caution. Only 20% of analysts covering the company rate shares the equivalent of Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is about 55%. The average stock-price target among analysts is about $78, some 20% below recent levels.Beyond shares are up about 120% from their 52-week low—set the day of the initial public offering—but down almost 60% from its record high. It’s been a bumpy ride for shareholders.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comCloseSell Beyond Meat Stock, Analyst Says.
