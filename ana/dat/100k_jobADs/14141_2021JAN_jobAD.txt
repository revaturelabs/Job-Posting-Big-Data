"Blue Sky Disney: The Latest Jobs Report...skip to main | skip to sidebarSaturday, December 20, 2008The Latest Jobs Report...No, this isn't an article on the state of the economy...There's a great deal of buzz going around after Apple's major, double-wamy announcement about Macworld/Steve Jobs made the papers, wires and Net.We received a few interesting e-mails about it and I found several interesting articles online.Wired Magazine has an interesting article about the whereabouts of Mr. Reality Distortion Field himself as does a story over at Fortune. Then there's a post over at Fortune's Apple Blog about why the Fruit Company is better off without Macworld. It's going to be a curious ride for Apple all the way through the first week of January when we experience Phil's deflowering at his headlining keynote.Interesting times lie ahead...Posted by Honor Hunter at 12:02 AMLabels: Apple, Business, Steve Jobs2 comments:Anonymous said...Nice pic you made.December 20, 2008 at 10:54 AMHonor Hunter said...Thanks, but as much as I'd like to claim credit for it, I'm not that talented and don't have the time to make something so, uhm... graphically intensive. Is that the right word? Is that a word? Whatever...I only did very minor alterations to it. It was found on the Net while hunting up the occasional Zach Efron rumors.Yeah, right. Like that's gonna happen.December 20, 2008 at 11:06 AMPost a CommentNewer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)Blue Sky Disney Archive► 2013 (217)► December (2)► November (4)► October (15)► September (18)► August (19)► July (13)► June (19)► May (76)► April (15)► February (5)► January (31)► 2012 (255)► December (19)► November (20)► October (19)► September (18)► August (35)► July (55)► June (48)► May (13)► April (10)► March (4)► February (9)► January (5)► 2011 (195)► November (5)► October (7)► September (11)► August (14)► July (17)► June (17)► May (15)► April (20)► March (37)► February (26)► January (26)► 2010 (407)► December (19)► November (28)► October (33)► September (34)► August (48)► July (44)► June (36)► May (40)► April (40)► March (29)► February (24)► January (32)► 2009 (658)► December (37)► November (39)► October (46)► September (61)► August (69)► July (94)► June (53)► May (38)► April (47)► March (69)► February (57)► January (48)▼ 2008 (649)▼ December (60)Rhapsody In Blue Sky (Part Two)...Top Ten Films Domestic/International 2008.Rhapsody In Blue Sky (Part One)...How To Be Andrew Stanton...Mouse Premiers Guinea Pigs Today...In Memorium: Lumiere (1935-2004)100,000,000.00 Dog...In Memorium: Catwoman/Yzma (1927-2008)Noel...Mouse Not On Voyage...Blue Sky Buzz(Mini Update): Name Calling...The Competition In 2009: New Monsters vs. Aliens T...Box In TR2N...Fate/Coincidence?Gee, Our First Shots Of Force...Animated Jones And The Quest For Dini...The Competition In 2009: New 9 Trailer...In Memorium: VHS (1977-2008)When George Lucas Could Do No Wrong...Black Holes & Revelations...Snow Seventy-One Years Before Christmas...Gates Of Power, Gates Of Opportunity...The Latest Jobs Report...Agent Of Chaos Spoils Event...More Tron 2Bits...Wall-E Wins Again, The Chicago Way...Before The Dark Times, Before The Empire...Retrography: The 70's...Seeing Surrogates...TR2N In 3D2?Up On Up...The End Of The World As We Know It...Cast2n Beg2s...Scrooge's Silver Anniversary: Disney Style...Thundering Forward...Robot & Millionaire Tie...Up Updated...AFI's Top 10 Films Of 2008...Pixar's Goofy...Decadent Dave's Blue Sky Disney Mini-Review: Punis...Odds & Ends, Bits & Piece 3: The Missing Links...The Black List...WOW-E...ABC Gives Exiled Chance...Pixar Short, Disney Film...Awakenings Past Remembered...Release Dated...Dreams Were Born Today...Small Creators Sell Salisbury To Disney...Of Mice & Dragons...A Fifth Outing For Jones?Mickey's Replacement...Coming in 2009: A Disney Sideshow...Annie Annoucements...Beyond The Black Hole...The Classic Past, Posted...3 Pigeons/Three Interviews...ElecTRONic Chatter...Mouse Releases Witch...Bolt's Jolt...► November (52)► October (58)► September (53)► August (60)► July (77)► June (52)► May (53)► April (53)► March (44)► February (55)► January (32)► 2007 (393)► December (32)► November (35)► October (39)► September (71)► August (55)► July (44)► June (61)► May (25)► April (8)► March (6)► February (6)► January (11)► 2006 (24)► December (12)► November (12)ContributorsColonel KurtzDecadent DaveHonor HunterShrunken NedTHX-1138Tron UnitBlue Sky Disney is not connected to or affiliated with the Walt Disney CompanyThe opinions represented here are of the authors entirely, and do not represent the views or policies of anyone else, or other companies."
