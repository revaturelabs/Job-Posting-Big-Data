YouTube user Braziliandanny wanted to see what the same style would be like for something more mundane, so he created this brilliant parody by shooting some first-person footage of a boring day at his desk job and then editing the clips together, GoPro commercial-style.Just hours after the video was published, GoPro left a comment on it, saying: “Every day office HERO! #GoPro”Source Article from http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PetaPixel/~3/2i4ZVJMCJr4/Chris Roubis PhotographerStarted out doing photography at the age of 6 using an uncle's old 1940 kodak brownie box camera. At 15 years of age, I decided to buy my very own 1975 Praktica SLR camera. I now shoot with a Nikon D850. I do unpaid TFP and commercial paid work. I also do Video Editing.
