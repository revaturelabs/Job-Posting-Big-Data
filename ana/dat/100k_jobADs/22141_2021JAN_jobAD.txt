People who are organized feel most comfortable when there is a sense of order. They are best served in jobs that allow them to develop plans in order to reach specific goals. Whether you like to work with people, places or things, here are some ideas for career paths if you are highly organized.MerchandiserIf you’re organized and you love retail, merchandising is a solid career choice. Merchandising entails arranging retail items so that they are appealing to shoppers. Being organized is handy in the field because you spend a great deal of time straightening and putting things back on the shelves and hooks where they belong. If you have a super neat sock drawer or closet then this position in retail may strike a chord with you. In addition, some merchandisers work independently and service a route of stores instead of just one. Therefore, not only are you organizing things but also your time as you won’t have a boss standing over you all day making sure you get things done.Event PlannerThere may not be a better job choice for a highly organized person than event planning. People who work in this field spend countless hours arranging schedules and making sure everyone is in the right place at the right time. In any given event, they have their hands in all aspects from pre-planning to clean up. Event planners excel when they are highly organized because even a small event has a lot of little details to take care of. For example, if you were planning a This Is Your Life party, not only would you make sure that the food was prepared when needed but also that the surprise guests were hidden away and the emcee had his script ready to go. You can only keep track of many details like that if you are highly organized.Travel AgentOne area of life that always requires being on top of details is traveling. Unless you are a backpacker-type who likes to wing it, making sure you get from point A to point B takes some organizing. When you are a travel agent, it’s even more important to be highly organized because the fate of other people is in your hands. As a travel agent, you regularly organize travel accommodations like flights and rental cars, as well as hotel stays and cruises. You may also arrange a customer’s itinerary and coordinate things to do while they are on vacation.Real Estate AgentPerhaps one of the most challenging careers you can have in terms of being organized is as a real estate agent. Being an agent in this field requires many different skill sets. You have to keep track of all of your customers’ contact information, the details of your listings and the deadlines of your contracts. In addition, just arranging a day of showings takes a lot of organizational strength. If you don’t schedule your showings in geographical order, while figuring in the time it takes to complete the route, not only will you not see all of the houses you intend to but your client will also not be happy.ResourcesOrganize this: A Six-figure incomeWriter BioBased in the Midwest, Gina Scott has been writing professionally since 2008.
