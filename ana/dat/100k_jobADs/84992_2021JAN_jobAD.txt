[+] could result in age bias complaints and litigation.GettyWhile unemployment numbers continue to climb, the reopening of states across the U.S. brings hope for economic recovery. Many of the companies that released or furloughed employees due to the impact of coronavirus have already begun rehiring.The process of recruitment – from the language used when posting a job ad to selecting the hire – must ensure equal opportunity. While gender and race are often top-of-mind from a diversity perspective, age is a protected category that is often overlooked.When a recent ad appeared on LinkedIn for an immediate need, it included a limit on experience. According to two employment attorneys, that’s a red flag that could result in an age bias complaint and subsequent litigation.Job postings like this one that limits experience could indicate age bias and result in a lawsuit.LinkedInWritten Evidence Increases Liability“That advertisement looks pretty dicey to me,” says private labor and employment attorney Steven Mitchell Sack, about the LinkedIn post. “The Age Discrimination in Employment Act generally makes it unlawful to include age preferences, limitations, or specifications in job notices or advertisements and this ad clearly states a limit.”MORE FOR YOUOn The Pandemic And AccessibilityDiversity Is Great But Will Organizations Be Ready For Inclusion In 2021?5 New Year’s Resolutions For People With DisabilitiesAge claims are the most difficult of all the protected categories to prove, according to Sack, because direct evidence is often difficult to obtain. Companies are typically more liable when they put things in writing, like a discriminatory job advertisement that lists specific preferred criteria.“When you have direct evidence like this job ad, and it can be backed up by statistics such as the average age of the last 30 hires was 35, it can be used against a company in either an individual or class-action lawsuit.”Earlier this year, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) settled a class-action lawsuit for age discrimination in hiring by agreeing to pay $11.6 million. The suit charged PwC for filling most of its positions through college campus recruiting, thus creating limits to older workers when they failed to post the entry-level accounting jobs on its website.No Blanket AssumptionsJob postings that limit experience could put a company at risk, according to David Miller, a Labor and Employment Lawyer with Bryant Miller Olive. “It suggests a desire for younger applicants. However, degree of experience does not directly and always correlate to age and, therefore, more evidence would be needed to establish liability.”“Was there a demonstrable general pattern of hiring youngsters instead of older folks? On the flip side of the coin, can the employer document that it had a limit on how much it could pay for this position and pay was strongly linked to experience? Could it show that it had fairly considered second-career applicants who were older, but still fit under the experience limits?”A frequent defense for targeting applicants with limited experience is that they are cheaper labor. One cannot make a blanket assumption that anyone with over ten years of leadership experience is not salary negotiable. That myth has been debunked in numerous studies.A Harvard Business Review (HBR) article published late last year suggested that age bias is one of the biggest and most problematic types of bias in the workplace. The generalization that a more experienced worker will demand more money is a myth that automatically excludes older talent. The HBR piece suggests that hiring managers look at pay equity by job and level versus tenure. “Tenure is not a useful measure for pay, unless it directly translates into experience and skills that drive value to the company.”“A blanket assumption should not be made that an older and more experienced person may not be willing to accept a position for which he is ‘overqualified,’ even if it pays less than a job commensurate with his experience would ordinarily command,” says Miller. “People find themselves in all sorts of life situations.”Miller shares a story of an acquaintance who held a first-line supervisor job and left it to take care of his sick wife. When he returned, all that was available was a part-time, poorly paid and non-supervisory job for which he was overqualified.“For him it was perfect because he didn’t want the stress and still needed more time off to care for his wife, even though she was better,” Miller says. “They offered him the job, and he gratefully took it. He got exactly what he needed, and the company got the best part-time, entry-level employee they could have.”RecommendationsMiller suggests that, as a best practice, employers question themselves when considering a hiring restriction. How are they restricting? Are they in a protected class? Is there a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason?“Does language in a job posting that limits applicants to those with less experience put a company at risk? Yes, for sure, because it invites this kind of scrutiny.”“The employer needs to ask itself what it is really looking for. If it only wants to pay up to a certain maximum, then just say that and don’t use experience as a proxy for pay limitations. If the employer wants a less-experienced employee because it wants to train them from a blank slate to do it ‘the company way,’ then say that instead of ‘only recent graduates considered’. Otherwise, the employer is laying itself open to a lawsuit.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
