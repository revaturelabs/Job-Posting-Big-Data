We are asking local businesses who think they may be able to support to come along to our launch event on 22 October and help us to help give people who have experienced the grip of addiction and homelessness a chance to rebuild their lives.”Natalie Wells, Business and Client Manager at The Howarth Foundation, added:“Employment is often the final piece of the puzzle for our clients, and having a regular job gives them a sense of purpose and can significantly reduce their chances of remission.“However, we recognise that, for many businesses, offering employment to someone who has spent time homeless can be a daunting prospect. That’s why The Howarth Foundation works closely with all our employers to match the right candidate with the role, and we then provide ongoing support, including HR and employment law support through our family firm Howarths, with regular review points once the candidate has been placed in the business.”Mr Howarth added:“We know the Business Building Futures scheme works, and we have been able to make a lasting difference to our clients’ lives while providing businesses with some of the most loyal, dedicated and enthusiastic employees they will ever recruit.“Our clients want to do well at work, they want to succeed, and they want to feel they have a purpose in life again. We are now asking businesses across Kirklees to get on board and help us make that a reality.”The Business Building Futures launch event takes place at The John Smith’s Stadium in Huddersfield from 4pm – 6pm on Tuesday 22 October.
