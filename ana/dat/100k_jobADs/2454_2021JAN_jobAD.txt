This career requires strong knowledge of a company’s business plans when designing the system’s layout and ensuring the network is situated to best meet the organization’s goals. They are also responsible for establishing what hardware is needed and determining how it will be placed around the logical network, including offsite locations.Network engineers manage previously established networks as well, though this consumes significantly less of their time than planning new ones.
