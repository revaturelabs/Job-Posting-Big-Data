Right or wrong, recruiters and hiring managers view steady employment as an indication of a candidate’s work ethic and ability. That’s why keeping a job is such an important and overlooked part of developing your career.So, set yourself up for success. Once you’ve landed your new gig, here are a few tips for keeping it long-term.Keep a Positive Attitude:No matter what your job is or what industry you work in, attitude is everything. Being aware of your attitude – and how it affects the people around you – is an important skill to have. It shows you’re engaged and ready for the long haul.Conduct Yourself Professionally:Behaving professionally doesn’t have to mean boring. Rather, it should mean you exhibit an air of courtesy, respect and confidence. How you communicate, both verbally and non-verbally, should reflect that.Be a Team Player:There is hardly a job today that doesn’t involve working within a team setting. Small or large, effective teams play to each member’s strengths and expertise to accomplish a shared goal. Good communication, follow-through and support are how you build trust and strengthen work relationships with your colleagues.Offer to Help Out:Raising your hand – putting yourself out there – can seem daunting. But taking on new projects and challenges shows initiative, confidence and a desire to grow. Not only will this help you stay challenged and engaged in your current role, it’ll demonstrate that you’re able to grow within your organization.Never Stop Learning:Continuous professional improvement can come in many forms. While traditional schooling – taking college courses, earning professional certifications, or accruing continuing education credits – is valuable, it’s not your only source of learning. Every interaction in our day affords us the opportunity to learn. Reading a trade journal, talking to a colleague in a different department, or just taking the time to observe your surroundings can be valuable sources of information.Get More at Goodwill:If you want more tips on finding and keeping your new job, check out the Goodwill Workforce Connection Centers.
