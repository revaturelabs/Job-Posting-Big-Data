Seems like it's moving fast. I accepted the tentative offer on 23 october. have the medical exam on 4 november, SI and PFT 1 on 13 november. Just submitted the SF86 the other day. Is it normal for the first parts to be moving quick? From what I read its normally slow.And also quick question is the PFT 1 still sit ups, push ups, step test? So many conflicting info on the web and other forums and just wanted to clarify. any info would be greatly appreciated.thanks!CommentPostCancel5 - 88 comments#58816.5Mike_lowrey commented11-03-2019, 10:04 AMEditing a commentI’d hope being young does benefit the BI. I know for a fact mine isn’t complex.#58816.6itwasjustifi3d commented11-03-2019, 04:34 PMEditing a commentMike I would hope so too! Im 21 so there really isn't that much to work off for me. I have a spotless record, not even a driving ticket, and all my references can give a positive remarks for me. And other than school and one part time job shouldn't be too difficult for the investigator.#58816.7Mike_lowrey commented11-05-2019, 01:23 PMEditing a commentSameeeee here. Time is on our side. 21, spotless record, in college, and a part time gig.#58816.8xknuckles commented11-06-2019, 08:06 PMEditing a commentI don’t think anything has to do with age. I’m young as well and I’m going to hit the one year mark already.corsairForum MemberJoin Date: Mar 2019Posts: 47ShareTweet#5881711-01-2019, 10:16 PMNearly 34 weeks since SI - keeping myself busy sure has helped pass the time. The last few pages have been pretty informative regarding EOD, incentive pay, and picking locations.

I took it on 11-8-17 it took forever to actually clear. If I dont get the call before this Friday the 8th ...does my medical expire? Or does it expire from the actual date it was all cleared?My fitness test was take on 11-20-17 .I would hate to have to do all this over again and wait some more after have finally passed everything.Any feedback is appreciatedCommentPostCancel1 - 33 comments#58818.1David1984 commented11-02-2019, 02:18 PMEditing a commentncavazos dont quote me on this but I read somewhere on here a while back that your fitness test is good and don’t have to retake it as long as you didn’t apply to a different announcement after your 1 year after passing your fitness test.So if you are in the same announcement you should be good. But again I could be wrong hopefully someone else can confirm this.#58818.2ncavazos commented11-02-2019, 02:43 PMEditing a commentHow about the medical? It's going to be 2 years on that as well this Friday.#58818.3David1984 commented11-02-2019, 02:48 PMEditing a commentncavazos if you go back 1 previous page the last few post someone asked the same question and people commented.

Does anyone know how that works?CommentPostCancel1 - 22 comments#58821.1merlin436 commented11-03-2019, 06:05 AMEditing a commentIt's a BP thing. OFO has nothing similar to it.Supposedly, it helps to address potential corruption and misconduct issues within the BP. Whatever address one gives as an applicant has a 100 mile bubble around it. Within that bubble, the chances of getting an initial hire as a PA fall under the rule. It doesn't apply to relocations, so nothing stops a person from ultimately migrating back to his backyard of usual haunts.#58821.2Klumper23 commented11-03-2019, 10:19 AMEditing a commentAwesome thank you!Kevin1234Forum MemberJoin Date: Jul 2017Posts: 68ShareTweet#5882211-03-2019, 10:40 PMAfter being made an offer and getting an EOD 3 weeks ago.

How long does this part take?CommentPostCancel1 - 22 comments#58826.1raudy06 commented11-04-2019, 02:14 PMEditing a commentno specific time frame. after you re-certify you will meet with your BI In person a couple of weeks later, he/she will meet with references, and all past employers etc. he/she will will send their final report to OPR and will stay there until they approve it.. that should take 2-3 weeks to happen and then you have to wait for the approval. Everyone is different mine took 8 months to get the green light, yours might be before since you already have a a provisional. Its possible you start the academy and still be waiting on Background to get the green light, thats why you got a provisional.Last edited by raudy06; 11-04-2019, 02:17 PM.#58826.2antoniojeff808 commented11-04-2019, 04:52 PMEditing a commentBeen 2 mos since i first met my BI.

And what occurs at this meeting?CommentPostCancel1 comment#58828.1antoniojeff808 commented11-04-2019, 08:00 PMEditing a commentThat was my case. Couple wks after i passed poly, i got a call from the BI itself to make an arrangement for the interview. About a month since passing the poly to meeting the BI. My BI flew out from mainland to Hawaii, spent a wk on the island for all the interviews.Last edited by antoniojeff808; 11-04-2019, 08:28 PM.SpinyNorman83Forum MemberJoin Date: Oct 2019Posts: 4ShareTweet#5882911-05-2019, 10:09 AMUpdate:Job Announcement:CBPO DH GS9 18-6Applied: 05/2018Interview: 06/2018Fitness Test/Medical Exam: 06/2018? - Completed the initial medical exam and did the fitness test the same day and same locationMedical: 07/2018 - 08/2019Polygraph: 10/03/2019Drug Test: 10/14/2019Background Review: TBDFinal Offer Letter:10/29 - Lukeville, ArizonaEOD: 03/30 - Gives me time to move across countryFLETC: 04/16-08/20Spanish Immersion Training: ? - I assume six weeks starting after graduationAlthough this station is out in the middle of nowhere and is located 2.5 hours south of Phoenix, this gives me an opportunity to be able to gain more experience at a smaller border crossing than a larger one. Although the morale there has been described online as low, because the lack of any surrounding area, the rain closing the one highway, and having to live at least 40 minutes north of the location, I am trying to look at the positives to being assigned there. Never know what the next opportunity holds and how much you can learn in a smaller location.1 likeCommentPostCancel1 - 22 comments#58829.1TsFost commented11-06-2019, 02:09 AMEditing a commentSee you at FLETC in april.
