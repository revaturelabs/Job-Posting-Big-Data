It means you do not save any time by working too fast; hurrying will cause mistakes.Getting a job here in Japan is not easy, but you shouldn’t take any job just because you feel you are running out of time. It’s important that you take time the think to think over whether or not this job is the one that you want.1. The reality of Job hunting for international studentsIn 2008 the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided to implement the project, “ Global strategy “ which is to open up Japan around the world and help to expand the smooth flow of “ People・Things・Money・Information”.As a part of this project, they launched a plan to “Increase the number of international students up to 300,000“ by 2020. According to a survey done by JASSO in May, 2018, the number of international students reached 298,980 which almost achieved the expected number. Now, 60 % of those who have graduated from schools want to get a job in Japan but only half of them managed to get a job. Clearly job hunting activities for international students are not doing well. Reasons for this include language issues, a lack of knowledge about the Japanese complicated job hunting system etc.It is true that nowadays many companies do not only focus on international students’ language skills. Japanese companies are also interested in using foreign students in their Sales and Marketing departments too. The only issue is that it is difficult for both parties to find the right student for the right job.2. Plan aheadIn Japan, there are rules and schedules about job hunting activities. The starting point of job hunting activities is March of the previous year when you graduate from schools. The companies also start releasing employment information and accepting entry sheets (like resumes). Therefore, an international student like you, also needs to start attending seminars and joint briefing sessions, requesting employment information and sending entry sheets to the companies you are interested in. Companies check the entry sheets first, and if they think they want to meet you, they will get in touch with you. The entry written tests and the actual interviews will start from June and the official job offers ( known as “ Naitei “ ) will be in October.Although It was decided that these rules would be abolished by March 2021 it seems like that it will remain as it is for the time being. But, if you can set yourself a clear goal, visualize what you have to do and when you have to do it by, you should be able to proceed without any major problems.3. If you run out of time, change your visaEven if you plan ahead and work hard, you might run out of the time before you find a job. But do not worry, you can change your visa type from Student to Designated Activities( job hunting ). The key point for this is that you can prove;You have been looking for a job while you are at university, college, post graduate school or vocational school.You have been a good student and will be able to graduate / have graduated from these schools.You have enough support to continue looking for a job.There will be no problems with the first two points. Possible issues could arise with the financial side. You have to prove that your living costs will be covered, by showing the bank balance or some documents to show that you have enough money coming in regularly. You can also get a part time job during this time if you get permission in advance.4. Found the job, but…If you plan ahead and start job hunting activities early, then it is possible that you may find a job while you are still at school. Then, your future employer / company will issue a “naitei “ which is a type of contract that states that you will be working for them after your graduation. At most schools in Japan the school year ends in March, so you graduate from school and start working from April. There will be no issue for a student of vocational schools as many of these schools end in March, but some of the other schools end in September. In this case, there will be a gap between the graduation timing and the start of your job. But don’t worry. You can change your visa type from Student to Designated Activities(naitei, job promised). If you are on a Designated Activities visa, looking for a job, then you find a job but you have to wait for a while until you actually start working, then this visa is also applicable.5.
