During this latter period he had appeared in shows for the Shimberg, Theatre II at USF, the Gorilla Theatre, American Stage, Fresh! Live! Theatre!, etc. He appeared several years ago as the crotchety Professor Krempe (type casting?) in Playing with Fire: After Frankenstein for Jobsite. This season he will be playing the crotchety Judge Popper (type casting again?) in The History of the Devil. As the oldest member of this season’s emsemble, he is pleased to be working with the talented – and young – Jobsite crew again.Jobsite ProductionsPlaying With Fire: After Frankenstein	The History of the Devil	Jobsite IsThe independent, not-for-profit theater company in residence at the Shimberg Playhouse at the David A.
