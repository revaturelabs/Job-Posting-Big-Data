The perimeter is painted maroon!The court last year just took so much energy away from the place, made me feel cold and depressed and a lack of energy.It is still the gray color but they finally gave the outside a maroon paint job. Made zero sense why it wasn’t already like that. Very happy.Last edited: Nov 14, 2020Reactions: Zeppelin Gopher, Moonlight, LongLiveMilesTarver and 1 other personDdie hard gopherWell-known memberJoinedMay 20, 2013Messages9,029Reaction score472Points83Nov 14, 2020#2Reactions: Zeppelin Gopher and LongLiveMilesTarverMMplsGopherWell-known memberJoinedNov 4, 2017Messages19,831Reaction score4,225Points113Nov 14, 2020#3Fixed it for ya: the perimeter is painted Iowa State red.The seats are maroon.

The AD has decided they want the Barn's \"maroon\" to evolve to this red-ish hue over time.Look at the center-court scoreboard. Same red-ish hue. Eventually the seats and handrails will be painted this color, too.stocker08Well-known memberJoinedFeb 2, 2009Messages22,450Reaction score3,837Points113Nov 15, 2020#8MplsGopher said:Fixed it for ya: the perimeter is painted Iowa State red.The seats are maroon.

It's too bright to be considered \"cardinal\". You can tell there is a brownish hue to it. Honestly....the seats and the handrails are a darker shade of maroon too. I've got lots of apparel that isn't 100% consistent when it comes to the logo....and I can see why they wouldn't want the border to be as dark as the seats and the rails.See these logos for reference. Definitely a hint lighter than logo #1....but not enough to complain about. And who knows how it looks in person compared to in a picture.I will be filing this under \"non-issue\".Reactions: SelectionSunday and MoonlightMMplsGopherWell-known memberJoinedNov 4, 2017Messages19,831Reaction score4,225Points113Nov 15, 2020#9For what little it's worth. The top \"banner\" on the GH message board layout is the \"correct\" hue, in my opinion. If you bring it down to hover over the Goldy picture you posted, it seems to match perfectly:Now bring it to hover over the court picture:I don't know ... the handrails still look pretty spot on.

Looks Good!!Ooak_street1981Well-known memberJoinedNov 20, 2008Messages3,562Reaction score381Points83Nov 17, 2020#18I went to to the paint store with photo on my cell phone, and the worker told me cell phone images were pretty worthless in judging colors. He suggested I get a chip of the paint and bring it back.I took three \"sample\" squares back that I thought were close and only 1 of 3 was close and it was too light. I learned that this is a tougher than imagined thing.If you look at the Viking uniforms over the years you cannot be surprised by the difficulty as well.Assuming there is a real change, I like the \"browner\" maroon much better than the \"Iowa State\" redder maroon, that the 1977 MB #41 Jersey I have in my dresser seems to resemble. Of course Iowa State used to have a McDonald's color scheme and started to drift towards USC and the U of M sometime ago. Right now we seem to be closer to Arizona State than USC.Reactions: MplsGopherOtisWell-known memberJoinedAug 13, 2014Messages3,927Reaction score722Points113Nov 17, 2020#19From the Parkinglot said:Yes bring back the goody gopher dribbling the basketball at center court.

Just to add to the authenticity.But the board warping would be too much, although I'm not against painting the floor to make it look like it's warped even though it isn't to further our home court advantage.Bad GopherA Loner, A RebelJoinedNov 20, 2008Messages19,309Reaction score3,409Points113Nov 17, 2020#20MplsGopher said:Fixed it for ya: the perimeter is painted Iowa State red.The seats are maroon.

You end up with arenas full of yellow, red, and purple, too.nitramnaedActive memberJoinedNov 19, 2012Messages471Reaction score216Points43Nov 17, 2020#22I'm sure the University Maroon has a Pantone color match and I would guess that they have standard color mixes with all the major coating companies so I don't know how they could get this wrong unless that was what they wanted.nooramLeave my member out of it!JoinedNov 12, 2008Messages1,758Reaction score76Points48Nov 17, 2020#23For reference, here is official primary and secondary colors:U of M colorsReactions: nitramnaednitramnaedActive memberJoinedNov 19, 2012Messages471Reaction score216Points43Nov 17, 2020#24nooram said:For reference, here is official primary and secondary colors:U of M colorsClick to expand...Exactly.

The banner is the official \"UMN Maroon\" (RGB #7A0019), while the thumbnail of the document must have some kind of shading/filter applied to it for effect, as that upper block shows as RGB #990131. A solid \"shade\" lighter (I don't know the proper term).Interestingly, the banner/footer/buttons/etc. maroon used on Gopherhole is not an exact match either. It uses RGB #8A0822, but the difference is imperceptible to my eye.MMplsGopherWell-known memberJoinedNov 4, 2017Messages19,831Reaction score4,225Points113Nov 17, 2020#28Here is a 400x225 (16:9) patch of #7A0019:You must log in or register to reply here.Share:Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Tumblr WhatsApp Email LinkHomeForumsMinnesota Gopher sportsGolden Gopher Basketball ForumContact usTerms and rulesPrivacy policyHelpHomeRSSForum software by XenForo® © 2010-2020 XenForo Ltd. | Media embeds via s9e/MediaSitesTop Bottom"
