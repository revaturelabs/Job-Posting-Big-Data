It conducts basic biological and biomedical research in all fields in which non-human primates play essential roles: in particular in infection research, the neurosciences and organismic primate biology. Besides its research infrastructure in Göttingen, the DPZ maintains four field stations for research on and with primates.The Infection Biology Unit of DPZ investigates virus-host cell interactions and their impact on viral spread and pathogenesis.Within a DFG-funded project a position for onePhD Student (m/f/d)is available as of now (TV-L E 13, 65%, funding is initially available for 36 months). The goal of the project is to identify host cell factors required for ER import of envelope proteins of emerging viruses (including SARS-CoV2).and to elucidate whether they constitute potential targets for antiviral intervention.The PhD student will be intimately involved in the generation of ER import factor knock-out cell lines by CRISPR/Cas9, establishment of readout systems (signal peptide reporter assays), selection of mutant viruses, quantification of import factor upregulation by qRT-PCR, preparation of RNA and cell lines for subjection to RNAseq and SILAC-based proteomics (by cooperation partners in Göttingen), and inhibitor studies on cell lines and primary cells.We anticipate candidates with very good communication skills, time management and the ability to work independently and as part of a team. First experiences with independent planning of experiments are required. Prior experience in virological methods, cell culture (especially CRISPR/Cas9 techniques), cloning and protein biochemistry (protein expression and characterization by immunoblot or immunofluorescence) is considered an advantage.The appointment at DPZ follows the regulations of civil service. Disabled applicants with equal qualification will be given preferential consideration. We kindly ask you to indicate in your application if you are disabled.Please send your written application, including all certificates and two letters of recommendation, until the 31th January 2021 under key word “Infection Biology Unit PhD student” via mail to bewerbung(at)dpz.eu.For further information please see http://www.dpz.eu or contact hhofmann-winkler(at)dpz.eu for details on the project.www.dpz.euPrivacy StatementLegal noticeRSS"
