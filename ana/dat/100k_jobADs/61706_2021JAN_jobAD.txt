Key functional responsibilities will cover: delivery of the global reward strategy and policies, with responsibility for the implementation, analysis and administration of the Global compensation and benefits programme. Provide support in the research, analysis and design of the firm's global C&B strategy and lead in the management of the Group's Equity Plans, including design, implementation, delivery and regulatory and tax considerations. Liaise with global finance departments to ensure accruals for equity and cash compensation cycles are appropriate and maintained.
