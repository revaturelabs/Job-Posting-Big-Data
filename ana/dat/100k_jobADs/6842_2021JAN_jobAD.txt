The S&P 500 index fell 1.16% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index dropped 0.69%. U.S. equities accelerated to the downside after New York City announced that it will close down in-person schooling beginning tomorrow.

As of November 17, hospitals in the U.S. have 76,830 Covid patients according to the Covid Tracking Project. The figures are alarming and experts are stressing that many regions’ hospitals are at or near capacity.U.S. Currently Hospitalized Covid PatientsSource: The Covid Tracking ProjectThe announcement out of NYC reversed earlier optimism after Pfizer announced that they are ready to submit their Covid vaccine under the FDA’s emergency use authorization. The news-driven sentiment echoed across the broader market, hitting the sentiment-linked Australian Dollar.Recommended by Thomas WestwaterImprove your trading with IG Client Sentiment DataGet My GuideThursday’s Asia-Pacific Outlook:The Australian Dollar moves into focus with October’s employment report set to cross the wires at 00:30 GMT. According to the DailyFX Economic Calendar, Australia is set to report a loss of 30k jobs and a 0.3% uptick in its unemployment rate. AUD/USD has climbed nearly 4% higher since October’s close, as vaccine headlines helped bolster the Aussie-Dollar.AUD/USD has been hovering above the 0.73 handle this week, but a disappointing jobs report would likely pressure prices to the downside. The 2019 high at 0.7295 may provide some support if we see Australia report figures in line with expectations. However, any significant miss to the downside would likely see notable selling pressure. If the jobs report does disappoint, a drop to a prior trendline from September may be in play.AUD/USD Four-Hour ChartChart created with TradingViewAUD/USD TRADING RESOURCES— Written by Thomas Westwater, Analyst for DailyFX.comTo contact Thomas, use the comments section below or @FxWestwateron Twitterbest trading platformsforex tradingforex trading brokersforex trading newsforex trading platformsforex trading updatesonline forex tradingtrading platformsShare0	previous postCanadian Dollar Technical Outlook: USD/CAD, CAD/JPY, NZD/CADnext postBitcoin analyst sees ‘perfect backdrop’ for $100K this bull cycle, $1M by 2035adminRelated postsGold Price Rebound Brings Former Support Zone on Radaradmin December 3, 2020Choppy markets revive quest for RFQ’s ‘magic number’admin May 28, 2020S&amp;P 500 Hits Record High on Stimulus Hopes, Straits Times Index May Riseadmin December 2, 2020Leave a Comment Cancel ReplyYou must be logged in to post a comment.Posts CategoriesCrypto Currency (1,733)Bitcoin (1,102)Crypto Mining (2)Ethereum (650)Mix Currencies (8)Monero (84)Price Analysis (138)Make Money Online (200)Get Paid To (3)How To Earn Money (24)Remote Home Jobs (80)Work From Home (85)Online Investment (226)PAMM Investment (1)Stocks Investment (223)Online Small Business (23)Online Trading (1,217)Binary Options Trading (12)Binary Options Brokers (6)Online Forex Trading (1,205)Forex Brokers Reviews (1)Forex Trading Brokers (1)Forex Trading News (1,202)Services (1)Best PTC Sites 2019PaidVerts (2014)NeoBux (2008)Ojooo (2016)YSense (2007)Scarlet-Clicks (2009)DonkeyMails (2005)No-Minimum (2004)LinkGrand (2006)PrizeRebel (2007)GPTPlanet (2010)Blogrollearn cash onlinemake money onlineonline tradingPPCMate TestSearch for:SearchRecent postsPrecious Metals Analysis: Gold and Silver Buoyant as Real Yields Fall January 21, 2021Some institutional investors taking profit as Bitcoin retraces January 21, 2021Nasdaq Hits Record High as Biden Takes Office, Hang Seng Eyes 30,000 January 21, 2021Australian Dollar Forecast: Jobs Report Fails to Inspire AUD/USD January 21, 2021Bitcoin price searches for support near $35K, DeFi tokens move higher January 21, 2021Gold Price Forecast: XAU/USD Recovers but is the Rally to be Believed?
