"What’s the Best Coaching Job in the SEC? – Bird's BanterSkip to contentBird's BanterA potpourri of ramblings, stories, musings and opinions.SearchSearch for:College FootballWhat’s the Best Coaching Job in the SEC?Quick! Off the top of your head, what’s the best job in the SEC? We’re talking football, of course. That’s what we do here.So, what is it?Did I hear a goodly number of ‘Alabamas’ out there? Ok, that would be fair. But here is what the head coach at the University of Alabama, Nick Saban, thinks. In an article written by Dennis Dodd of CBS Sports, Saban compliments his former pupil, Kirby Smart, and also questions him as to why Georgia does not win on a grander scale. That is something that has left many pundits and fans scratching their collective heads over the years. That has been debated, ad nauseum, over the past eleven years. It’s how long it has been since the Bulldogs won an SEC championship. They haven’t won the Big Enchilada, a natty, since 1980.Smart now finds himself in the big chair, in Athens, and Dawg fans are howling… with glee. Time will tell if Georgia returns as a dominant power in the SEC East. We shall see.Now back to Saban. He thinks Georgia and LSU should be the top jobs in the conference. And that brings us back to our original question… What is the best head coaching job in the Southeastern Conference?Barrett Sallee make a a very solid and strong argument for Alabama. He thinks that is, pretty much, a no-brainer. It is difficult to disagree with him, whether you love or hate the Crimson Tide. The “Process” is hitting on all eight in T-Town and it doesn’t look like things are going to change in the near future.What about the rest of the league?I’m going to start at the bottom and work my way up to the top. This is what I think and you should take it with the very smallest grain of salt you can locate with a magnifying glass.Onward!14. VanderbiltA gimme, right? You don’t have to be Carnac The Magnificent to figure that one out. Vandy is the graveyard of coaching jobs in the SEC and it ain’t even close.13. KentuckyThey play basketball exceptionally well in Lexington.12. Mississippi StateStarkVegas. It holds no similarity, whatsoever, to the derivation of its, now popular, nick-namesake.11. South CarolinaWe’re about to be reminded, once again, how great a football coach Steve Spurrier really was.10. ArkansasOle Bret Bielema has done some good things in Fayetteville but he will never win the SEC West.9. Ole MissHugh Freeze has proven the Rebels can contend but Oxford is a place where no one will win, consistently, over an extended period of time.8. MissouriThe Tigers have won two out of the last three East division titles but it doesn’t appear that is going to happen again any time soon.7. TennesseeA lot of coaches around the country wish that they were up on Rocky Top.6. AuburnThey have both won a national championship and played for another, in the last six years, down on the Plains.5. Texas A&MThe resources in College Station are limitless.4. LSUI don’t think it’s one of the top two jobs in the conference but one could certainly argue that point.3. GeorgiaA great, great job that is begging to be the top one.2. FloridaIt’s been done here, one more than one occasion, and it, probably, will be done again.1. AlabamaIn the SEC? How about the country?That’s my two cents on how head coaching jobs rank in the Southeastern Conference. It’s entirely subjective and that’s one reason we love to spend much of our time, as SEC fans, debating countless subjects related to college football. Everybody has an opinion and, quite often, they are strong ones. Mull it over. Chime in!Hey! Only 127 days remain until Vanderbilt hosts South Carolina on a Thursday night!Share this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...Relatedautull May 20, 2016Leave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
