I’m glad I decided to work with her. I have worked with Sphere for a number of years and other agencies and I always return to Sphere over others. This is due to the companies professionalism and because of the way they conduct business. It’s really great how easy you all make the process of securing work and getting on placement. Jess has kept the values of the company upheld in this regard and making it a smooth experience. Every step of the way she has been professional and honest. A key component of agency contact is being honest with staff on placement and communication – it governs if a candidate returns to work for the company in the future. All communication through Jess has been fluid and transparent and she has always upheld her word. If there was a problem she addressed it promptly and professionally. It is with great pleasure, I’d look forward to working with Jess, on future assignments.I wish her the very best in her career, as she is an asset to the company.”Freelance LabourerSouth WalesThe dedicated service from Tayler and Andy was first class.
