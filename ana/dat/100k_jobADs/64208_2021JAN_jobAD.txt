partnerFriday 18-09-2020Interviewing for an executive position can be one of the most important in your job search. Your resume will help you get an interview, and reference checks and performance tests will be used to confirm the results of the interviews. None of these are going to get you employes. it is the one-on-one meetings, where you have the ability to speak directly to the hiring manager, that will inspire the organisation to recruit you.No matter how much you plan, it's never going to be the same as interviewing. Guessing what's important to the hiring manager will reveal some of the questions you're going to be asked, but you can't plan for every possible query. At some point, you will need executive interview coaching.Here are the areas of study that career coaches are doing to support clients with their interview coaching:Company – You should have a detailed understanding of what the organisation is doing, how and where it works, and any related news. It's really important to do your homework on the business. You should be able to express why you want to work there, what makes a fit for you, and what a unique quality you bring that aligns with the culture of the business. Candidates too often hold the response on the surface. Dive deep and really figure out why you want to join the squad!Industry – Depending on your position, you do not need to be an industry expert, but it is important to understand the main factors at play. This will help you better understand the job and whether this industry is something that excites you and continues to excite you in the future.Community – This isn't always instantly apparent, but your coach will help you find creative ways to assess the true culture, both during your study and during your interview. It's important to understand if these are people you're happy to be working with and if this is an atmosphere where you're going to succeed.People – You can understand who the key players are and do some research with whom you will be dealing directly. If possible, study the interviewers.Method and Questions – It's important to understand the company's interview process so you're not upset or caught off guard. You can also do your research to understand the questions that the company usually asks about this position.Mock interviews and coaching sessionsIt's time for the big one! You've extensively studied and trained, and now it's time to test your skills. Your coach will test your interviewing skills across these main areas:Professionalism – Are you a professional, knowledgeable and someone I'd be proud to welcome as a colleague of mine?Confidence/body language/enthusiasm – Do you have a clear body language, a decent pace, eye contact and nervous behaviours under control? Do you find yourself confident in your abilities and excited about the business and the role?Authentic / Personal – Do I believe what you say? Do you seem to be someone I want to work with?Awareness of company/preparation – did you do your homework? Is it clear that you want to work with this business in particular, and that you have a working knowledge of who we are and what we do?Leadership/culture – can you fit into our culture? Are you a powerful leader? Can you provide evidence of this by your answers?Evidence-based – professional – Do you have the skills and capabilities you need to succeed in this role? Can you provide evidence of this by your answers?enrol yourself for interview coaching at JobInterviewology today and be on your way to land your dream job!Share this articlePopular posts7 Intelligent Ways to Start Paying off Student Loan DebtGraduating from university is one of life’s greatest accomplishments, but it shouldn’t end with a lifetime of debt.
