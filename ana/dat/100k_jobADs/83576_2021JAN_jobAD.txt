Some of you who have not have been sent an email if I need to confirm further details. If you donated $2 or more this year and your golden icon hasn't turned over and you are not an 18-year donator and have not receive an email from amanda at gamerswithjobs dot com, please PM Amoebic so we can work it out!Hello everyone! This year, since our donation drive had turned 18 and is now old enough to vote, we'd like to involve the community in voting for this year's golden icon selection and looking to get your suggestions! Once we've gotten a good handful, we'll set up some polls and the icon with the most votes wins!The current year's Golden icons, numbered, for your reference. If it's too similar to a custom donor icon or previous icon, it may not end up in the final vote.We've received a couple of suggestions so far, so thanks to folks for submitting! If I haven't listed it, please repost here! I apologize for missing any. We'll start the list in the OP, and add them as suggestions are posted below.It has to be relatively small, so simple is best. Icons need to follow the code of conduct. Avoid anything political, religious, or culturally appropriative.Here's the list so far:Mars RoverjoyconGolden EyeCat“modern” controllerRocketGlobePeace signMonster truckLizardFrogMore cars!BananaLego blockSega Genesis controllerMousePair of 6 sided diceA ♥♥♥ life meterGolden Apple of DiscordA Golden Handshakedumpster fireAC turnipNook logochairFire TruckBig cat - lion or tiger (aka tiger king)Chess piece (Aka Queen’s Gambit)GroguCthulhuVoting BallotBedEagleRoll of Toilet PaperGas MaskWhoopie CushionWebcamHeadphonesLotus flowerfairy princessunicornrainbowThanks so much, everyone!

A globe5. A peace signPersonally, I’d rather the icon not be a memorial of this dumpster fire of a year. Just my $0.02.

A “modern” controller (generic shape to avoid fights)I'm fine with picking sides to begin with and eventually filling in the others. I was thinking a Genesis controller because we already have an NES one, and could just keep going down the line over time with memorable controllers for each of the big companies that have made console controllers over time. Maybe eventually adding a mouse or something for PC as well. I think a pair of dice would be cool if that's not too much for the small factor.So my suggestions:1. Sega Genesis controller2. Mouse3.

Syringe2. Facemask3. HouseI'm not sure about anyone else, but I'm a little traumatized by covid. As spot-on as it may be for 2020, I'm not sure covid-related icons is something I'm comfortable with, especially if anyone who lost someone to covid would have to carry that tag around for a whole year. If any get voted into the final rounds, we will need to have a discussion about it before proceeding.mrtomaytohead wrote:Banana would be fun, too.
