So, when Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Arbor Day… are you following me yet? Any holiday, no matter how big or small, is a day of rest for these fellas and they aren’t giving it up with out time and a half and then some.So, your brochure HAS to be ready to go July 7th? You need to have that sucker on a press by the third week of June, at the LATEST. I’m not kidding.Thank you, this has been a Public Service Announcement from your Friendly Neighborhood Designer.graphic designrandom musingsPost navigationPrevious PostAccessory QuestNext PostHow to Get Your Job Printed on Time, Part 2	Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
