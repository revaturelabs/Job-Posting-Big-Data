People who reach your site from a social bookmarking site are generally there because your Web site appeared in a search for topics were interested in.Social bookmarking tells search engines not to follow the link, and so you will not reap any benefit from additional links! This may sound rather strange, but people who book mark may use more than one bookmarking site. Search engines will often list results from bookmarking sites. Therefore, if your site bookmarked, this is an extra opportunity to show up in search results.FOLLOW US:About UsTerms of UseSpam PolicyCookie PolicyBlogPartnersContact UsCopyright © 2020 JobsPublish.com.
