I started at an interesting time in my personal life, but my coworkers showed support from the very beginning. I have not worked on a better team in my whole career. I am extremely thankful to work for a company who understands there is more to live than our jobs and values time with your family. I live a balanced life, my work time is work time and personal time is for me, my friends and family. I am blessed to have the opportunity to work remotely half the time, which also saves me time from commuting, plus saves on gas and wear and tear too! This job comes with some wonderful benefits and a decent amount of time off too. In addition to having ample time to travel for myself, I‚Äôve been given the opportunity to see four new places this year, Montreal, Atlanta, Frankfurt and Torino, all as a part of my job (granted Frankfurt is only a short trip as it‚Äôs whatever I can squeeze in tomorrow on my long layover). I‚Äôm in a job at a company that wants to know where I want to go next; there is plenty of room for growth in the future and I don‚Äôt fret about the stability of my job or company. Finally being at a company that values its employees as people, not just as another chip in their pile, is a wonderful feeling.Share this:TweetEmailLike this:Like Loading...workPost navigationDay 26 ‚Äì EducationDay 28 ‚Äì FrankfurtOne comment	Pingback: Day 30 ‚Äì Thankful for Everything ‚Äì grateful. thankful. blessed.Leave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
