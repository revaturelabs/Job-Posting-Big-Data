Two independent research groups said they stumbled upon the new strain while looking for signs that a highly transmissible variant from the United Kingdom had established itself here. Instead, they [...]Democrats: Passing Biden's immigration plan through Senate is 'a herculean task'It's taken only days for Democrats gauging how far President Joe Biden's bold immigration proposal can go in Congress to acknowledge that if anything emerges, it will likely be significantly more modest. As they brace to tackle a politically flammable issue that's resisted major congressional action since the 1980s, Democrats are using words like “aspirational” to describe [...]Actor Gregory Sierra, known for 'Barney Miller' and 'Sanford and Son' roles, dies at 83Gregory Sierra, who had memorable roles in the 1970s sitcoms “Barney Miller\" and “Sanford and Son,\" has died after battling cancer.
