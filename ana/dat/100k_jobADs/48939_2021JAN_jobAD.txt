This part of the city centre is seeing an influx of new offices and student accommodation so there is a market for more restaurants in this area to cater for what is anticipated to be an area of increased footfall. We have identified other sites across the city for potentially expanding the concept to a second location however we are entirely focused on the Wellington Place site for now.“I’ve always had a desire to fuse both Indian and Italian cuisine, so when we decided to open the restaurant I knew exactly what we wanted to create.“I am confident the people of Belfast and beyond will love what we have to offer.’’Chef Luigi, who worked for Paul Rankin for a number of years, brings four decades of experience with him. The chef, who came to Northern Ireland 20 years ago said he was delighted to be on board with the Mumbai Milano team.He added: “Northern Ireland has a longstanding love for both cuisines; however, it is rare to have a restaurant in which the customer can avail of the standouts from both cultures. People today desire good quality, delicious food, that is good value for money and that is exactly what we offer.“To be able to showcase these beautiful cuisines and create a fusion menu that we think will both intrigue and excite people is a delight.“So far the feedback has been great from the public.”The 120-seater restaurant opened its doors last week and will be open seven days a week. The menu includes everything from traditional Indian curries to authentic Italian pizza and pasta.General manager Liam Whiteway said: “The menu offers a wide range of classic Indian and Itallian meal options as well as some unique fusion choices.“All food offerings will be complemented by an extensive drinks and cocktail menu with quirky elements including cocktails infused with candyfloss, honeycomb and other sweet treats.“The interior fit out is stylish plush fabrics in a luxurious comfortable setting.”For more information go to http://mumbaimilano.co.ukShare.
