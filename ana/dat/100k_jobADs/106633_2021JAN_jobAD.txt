For that we need to stand for our common values and act together on a European scale. Our world is clearly on the road toward the formation of large political-economic blocks,”the programme states.Jobbik will name its candidates for the EP elections late in January or early February, Gyongyosi said.Source: MTI/Hungary JournalPhoto: MTIShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...Relatedthehungaryjournal December 30, 2018 EP2019, featured, Hungarian opposition, Jobbik, Marton Gyongyosi	Leave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
