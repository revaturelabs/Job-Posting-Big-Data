Clearly such a law should exist. You don’t have the ability to pay child support if you don’t earn money through your job. And you can earn money through your job if you don’t have that job due to no fault of your own.If Mom and Dad are married and Dad loses his job, the family’s lifestyle naturally and inexorably decreases in response to the resulting loss of income. This is unfortunate, but nobody can say this is unfair. What’s so perverse is that if Mom and Dad get divorced, and then Dad loses his job, he can (and almost always is) ordered to maintain the lifestyle of his ex-wife and children, even though he has no ability to do so. This is clearly not just unfair, but immoral, and it is not the purpose of the law to impose such impossible burdens.Utah Family Law, LC | divorceutah.com | 801-466-9277https://www.quora.com/Should-US-child-support-orders-reduce-support-if-their-supporting-parent-loses-their-job-through-no-fault-of-their-own/answer/Eric-Johnson-311Share this:TwitterFacebook: automatically supporting parent, Child Support, fault, greed, job, lifestyle, loses, married, no fault, order, ordered, politician, politics, reduce, reduced, underemployedRelated PostsHahn v.
