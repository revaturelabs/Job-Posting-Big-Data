Join me as an associate at my proudly independent practice, Neabore Veterinary Clinic, in Haddonfield ,New Jersey. After working in corporate practice, I came to realize that building lasting relationships with owners and pets is the best way to provide high value, individualized veterinary care. This led me to open my own clinic in 2019. My WHY: Be the hometown vet for the local community that loves to support local business. This informs all of our decisions as a business, from how we designed our exam rooms, what we post on social media, and how staff interact with clients.We are a small animal clinic located on the main street that connects the walkable, vibrant business districts of three neighboring towns: Haddonfield, Haddon Township, and Collingswood. I designed the clinic to be clean, welcoming, and bright with features such as a big picture window in the main exam room and personal touches like portraits of staff pets in the lobby commissioned from a local artist.I am looking for a veterinarian to not only join a team but also a community. All experience levels will be considered. This can be a great position for someone that wants to jump into a busy medical and surgical caseload but also a new grad looking for mentorship.Valid NJ Veterinary licenseNOTES:Additional Salary Information: Benefits include health insurance, paid vacation, paid CE, flexible scheduling, and matching retirement planInternal Number: VeterinarianCreate a Job Alert for Similar JobsAbout Neabore Veterinary ClinicNeabore Veterinary Clinic is an independent small animal practice located in Haddonfield NJ.
