Mum said there was no room left for her in the bed. I said, “Yes, is”, patted the bed and said, “see”. We slept until Mummy’s alarm went off at nine and I carried on snoozing for 5 until mummy arrived with milk and Tubbie cookies. Grandma collected me this morning to take me to see Daddy, I was a bit hesitant at first but tempted when I heard Father Christmas had been there too. I fell asleep in the car on the way home but woke up as soon as we got there. I showed mummy my new ride on tractor and trailer, computer, musical car, batman plane, pyjamas and £45.00! Mummy said tomorrow we would go and buy a batman to go in the car. I played nicely until 8.15 when mum gave me a tube of sweets, which I promptly lobbed, across the room in temper (and I’m not saying why). Next I knew I was in bed, despite me saying “I’m a good boy now”. Apparently that doesn’t count. Oh well, I’ll just have to be awkward and stay awake for the longest time possible. It was great; mum was really wound up by the time I went to sleep at 9.45. She should be grateful, I brought her a present back from Daddy’s a Cherished Teddy called Jerrod ‘don’t worry, it’s just another little bump in the road’.2019: Back to the office job today. It didn’t go too bad but Id rather be riding that tractor! Tonight is the first time Zof and I have been home together all week and we had planned to make our Christmas dinner but couldn’t be arsed to wait for it all. Two big dominos, sides, wine and Gavin and Stacey coming up. All went down a treat.#Kids #parents #family #CherishedTeddies #tractors #jobs #Christmas #Food #cooking #Pizza #DominosPosted on December 28, 2019 December 28, 2019 Categories anxiety and depression, crohn’s, chronic illness, diaries, mums, toddlers,parents, growing upTags christmas, growing up, jobs, tractorLeave a comment on December 27th – Christmas Jobs	Blog at WordPress.com.Privacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
