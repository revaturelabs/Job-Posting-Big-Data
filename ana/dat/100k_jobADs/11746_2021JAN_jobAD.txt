Studied Engineering at Nottingham University.There were several things that attracted me to Capital One – the opportunity to get involved in data-driven decision making, the flexible working hours and the fact that I’d get to live and work in Nottingham.I joined the Marketing and Acquisition team in November 2016, looking after the Direct Mail channel. I’ve been promoted three times since I joined and am now a Senior Manager. My biggest highlight so far was when I was part of a project that involved switching our third-party data supplier. The project led to a 500% increase in new business via the Direct Mail channel.The response model I built determined who would be mailed and when. I’ve been really impressed by how much senior stakeholders value your ideas and analysis. I feel proud that my idea went to market and offered our customers a frictionless application journey without impacting their credit score.Before joining Capital One I was completely new to the finance industry which has made it challenging. But I’ve received loads of support from my team. If I have any questions, they’re always more than happy to answer them and point me in the right direction.Related JobsSenior Strategy and Analytics AssociateLondonRelated ArticlesRead Chen's StoryChen – Data Scientist GraduateBA Case Study GuideCase interview - AnalystRead Tiff's StoryTiffany – Software Engineer GraduateSign up for job alertsDon’t see a role that’s right for you?
