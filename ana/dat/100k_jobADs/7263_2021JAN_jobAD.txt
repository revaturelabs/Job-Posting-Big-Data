We fell in love with Brazil while travelling through to Argentina after a few months in the beautiful Argentina ,we decided to move to Brazil. I have plans of attending university to further my studies in hospitality and management. Also i will be completing an online course as an english teacher. But sadly no employment as yet. Which is why I'm urgently seeking employment in the tourism and hospitality industry. I do not mind relocating. Please feel free to contact me for any additional information needed. Have a good day.CommentsLog in to join discussionRelated PagesCreate New PostHostel Jobs ForumHow to Work in HostelsOther TopicsSite News and FeedbackOff-topic ChatWork Abroad ForumTeach English AbroadKibbutz Volunteer JobsVolunteer AbroadOther Travel WorkResort and Hotel JobsThe LoungeTravel StoriesIntroduce YourselfBrowse WorkersBrowse JobsForumAboutÂ© Copyright Hostel Management International, LLC Use of this site subject to Website Terms , Privacy Policy, Forum Policy and DCMA"
