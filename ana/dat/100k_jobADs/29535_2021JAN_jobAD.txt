Now the pub has said it received over 2,700 applications in total after their advertisement went viral.Source: Sober LaneCommenting on the response to this unconventional hiring approach, owner Ernest Cantillon said it meant the company got “the most creative and outgoing staff without having to trawl through stack-loads of CVs and try to get to know someone on paper”.Instead, the applicants had ten seconds to impress, which is the most they are likely to have on a busy night in the bar so it makes sense – plus fun and having a laugh is what Sober Lane is all about. I was overwhelmed by the response and so grateful that we had such a huge pool of superb applicants to choose from.The official opening of the bar in Irishtown, Dublin 4, took place last Wednesday. Their ‘flip a coin’ game, whereby customers can win a free round if their luck is in, has unsurprisingly proven very popular already.Related: Want a job at this pub?
