I left behind the luxury of not only knowing how to get “home” without consulting a map, but also a space to call my very own. I know am once again living out of my suitcase and am on the road again. If you can’t tell, I’m a little hesitant to go back to the vagabond-Jill of last month, though seeing some new and amazing things is certainly in order!My first stop was Iguazu Falls. Even though it took a 17 hour overnight bus ride to get there, it was definitely worth it. They are spectacular! Pictures can’t even really do them justice. My only complaint was that it was so freaking cold there. Yes, I know that I’m in the southern hemisphere and because it is June, it is winter time here. Places here are not equipped to deal with this cold of weather (below freezing), and thus don’t even have heaters. I could quite literally see my breath inside my hostel. I’m really wishing I would have lugged along my Under Armour right about now…Share this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...RelatedCategories: South America	| 1 CommentPost navigation← Older postNewer post →One thought on “Iguazu Falls”	June 10, 2012DaveHow is that tree growing out in the middle of that falls?Reply	Leave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
