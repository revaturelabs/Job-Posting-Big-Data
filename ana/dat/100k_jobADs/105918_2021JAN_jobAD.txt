At the same time, people who attend the job fair are always very well informed about the employers and have their CVs ready to hand out to them.‚ÄùHoneywell at Jobspin Multilingual Job Fair in Brno, October 19, 2019.

The number of people unemployed has fallen to 201,900, the lowest figure since last September. The number of job-seekers in the market is currently very limited, but Jobspin Job Fair has nevertheless continued to grow with each event. After counting the number of people who registered online and the number of special job fair catalogues that were given out, the organizers estimated the attendance at 550, almost 10% more than at the previous fair.Jobspin Multilingual Job Fair in Brno, October 19, 2019.

However, by the late afternoon, it was obvious that people were staying longer than the previous time, as there were still new visitors arriving after 3pm. Last time I think we were already packing up our stand about this time,‚Äù commented one of the exhibitors.Jobspin Multilingual Job Fair in Brno, October 19, 2019. Credit: CG / Jobspin.After speaking with many of those attending the event, the organizing team reported that the majority of people were already based in Brno, or at least had visited previously.Based on the previously collected data and observation, the average age of visitors was between 25 and 35. However, the registration desk staff reported one couple in their 70s who are attending university as mature students.Job-seekers of various nationalities, education and backgrounds came to get fresh insights into Brno‚Äôs job market. According to Eduard Soukup, Team Leader at Grafton Recruitment, which provided the free CV consulting stand, the demographic of the visitors was similar to previous Jobspin Job Fairs in Brno. As usual, the majority of people had a university education and some work experience, often from their home countries. Most professionals at the Grafton stand had education in marketing or technical fields; the most frequent working backgrounds were finance and IT. ‚ÄúA group of Civil Engineering graduates came down all the way from Ostrava for the Jobspin Job Fair, which probably skewed the balance toward the technical field of knowledge,‚Äù said Soukup with a smile.Eduard Soukup, Team Leader at Grafton Recruitment, which provided the free CV consulting stand.
