XEI Scientific, Inc. is a small scientific business that manufactures and supplies anti-contamination systems for electron microscopes. The company produces and markets several lines of products for vacuum contamination removal on a world-wide basis. XEI Scientific, Inc. is one of the first companies to market commercial plasma cleaners that use downstream cleaning process to remove carbon contamination from electron microscopes. Among other accomplishments XEI Scientific has developed a unique radio frequency (RF) plasma generator, a patented RF hollow cathode electrode, and an easy start programmed plasma cleaning. The downstream plasma cleaner provides a solution to hydrocarbon contamination in vacuum chambers such as scanning electron microscopes (SEM) and transmission electron microscopes (TEMs). Hydrocarbons in the chamber of an SEM and TEM microscopes or on the samples cause a loss of optimal resolution in high magnification imaging crucial to obtain high quality images. The plasma cleaning process developed by XEI Scientific, Inc. provides an easy and cost effective solution to removing and minimizing hydrocarbon contamination as well as maintaining clean chamber conditions for obtaining best results.The company’s headquarters as well as manufacturing, production and R&D facilities are located in Redwood City, CA.
