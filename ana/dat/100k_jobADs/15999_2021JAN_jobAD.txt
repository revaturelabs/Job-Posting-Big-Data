Is that really true?Contrary to what some may believe, getting a job after graduating is not easy. For many graduates, it is extremely competitive and positions fill up fast. When you’re graduating with over $100,000 in loans, unemployment is not an option.If you don’t get a job in your field immediately after graduating you’re often forced into taking any position that pays the bills, even if it has nothing to do with your field of study. According to CNBC, more than 40 percent of college graduates take a job that doesn’t require a degree. Basically they are wasting about four years of their lives and are being left with a ridiculous amount of student loan debt for nothing.I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard someone say they picked their major because it has a surplus of job openings. I strongly believe we should choose a career we are passionate about. Would you really want a doctor who’s only there for the money? We should want someone who cares, someone who is driven by what they love to do.If I am paying to attend a college or university then I should at least be guaranteed a job in my field when I graduate, especially considering the growing cost of tuition. If I am a hardworking student, then my university should work just as hard to ensure my success.Whether it be helping students create resumes and portfolios, practicing interview strategies or networking within their field, this career preparation should be a priority at every institution.However, I don’t believe all of the responsibility should be put on the school. It should be equally divided between the institution and the student. Students shouldn’t expect a free handout because they showed up to class and joined a few online forums. To get this guarantee, they must be required to keep a certain GPA and obtain recommendation letters from professors in their department.Colleges and universities should want to see their students prosper. The more successful their alumni are, the more applicants they’ll get in the future. College is a business. Schools want you and your money. So be smart, know your worth and don’t commit until you make a deal.Contact the writer: [email protected]Twitter: @AGallagherTWWAbout the ContributorAshlynn Gallagher, Opinion EditorAshlynn is a senior Digital Media and Broadcast major and serves as the Opinion Editor for The Wood Word.
