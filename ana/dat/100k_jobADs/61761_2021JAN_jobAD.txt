Attendance reached 456 beneficiaries, all of whom finished work on May 29.“We consider SPES as one of the most relevant programs of our government because it helps the out-of-school youth to pursue their studies and also to help their parents in their day-to-day needs,” said PESO officer-in-charge Norman Mirabel.Mirabel noted that 40 percent of the beneficiaries’ salary was released by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), while the local government and private employers provided the remaining 60 percent. Aside from the salary, Taguig City also distributed free T-shirts to the youth.“The importance of this program to our city is that it serves as a bridge for Taguigeño students and out-of-school youth who are in need of financial assistance,” Mirabel explained. “Through this program, our youth gain work experience and knowledge working with different kinds of people.”Taguig City started implementing the SPES program in 2011 and has already benefited around 5,000 students until 2016.To be eligible for the program, an applicant should be 15-25 years old. All applicants submitted three copies of the duly filled-out registration Form 01 with ID pictures, validated by the school principal or registrar; any document attesting to his/her age; any document attesting to the student’s academic standing; and the latest income tax return of his or her parents, or a certification from the employer/union president that the parent of the applicant is to be displaced or has been displaced.Aside from providing jobs to students during the school break, Taguig City is also the lone local government unit in the National Capital Region (NCR) that conducts a job fair in different barangays for a full five days, and also in its main office thrice a week.PESO organized its first Independence Day job fair at Vista Mall in Barangay Ususan on June 12. It catered more than 1,000 Taguig-based job-hunters. ###FILIPINO VERSIONTaguig City nagbigay ng mga summer job para sa 1,000 SPES beneficiariesMahigit kumulang 1,000 kabataang Taguigeño ang kumita nitong bakasyon sa tulong ng mga trabahong ibinigay ng Taguig City Hall.Naatasang magtrabaho ang mga benepisyaryo, kasama ang mga mag-aaral at out-of-school youth, sa loob ng 20 araw sa lokal na pamahalaan o 45 na araw sa pribadong sektor.Ang nasabing deployment ay alinsunod sa programa ng pamahalaan na “Special Program for Employment of Students” (SPES), na nagbibigay ng tulong pinansyal sa mga kabataan tuwing bakasyon.Nagtalaga ang lungsod ng Taguig nang ikatlo at huling batch ng mga kabataan noong ika-13 ng Hunyo na binubuo ng 150 na benepisyaryo at inaasahang matatapos ang programa sa ika-11 ng Hulyo.Noon namang ika-15 ng Hunyo, ipinamahagi ng Public Employment Services Office ang sahod ng unang batch ng SPES. Mahigit 400 na estudyante na natapos ang employment program noong ika-29 ng Mayo ang dumalo rito.“Isa ang SPES sa mga itinuturing na pinakamahalagang programa ng ating gobyerno sapagkat natutulungan nito ang out-of-school youth na maipagpatuloy ang kanilang pag-aaral at para na rin matulungan ang kanilang mga magulang sa pang-araw-araw nilang pangangailangan,” wika ni PESO officer-in-charge Norman Mirabel.Ipinaliwanag ni Mirabel na 40 porsyento ng sahod ng mga benepisyaryo ay nagmula sa Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), samantalang ang natitirang 60 porsyento ay nanggagaling sa lokal na pamahalaan o pribadong sektor. Maliban sa kanilang sahod, nagmimigay rin ang Taguig City ng libreng T-Shirt para sa kabataan.“Mahalaga ang programang ito dahil nagsisilbing tulay ito para sa mga Taguigeñong mag-aaral at out-of-school youth na nangangailangan ng pinansyal na tulong,” paliwanag ni Mirabel. “Sa pamamagitan ng programang ito, magkakaroon ng karanasan sa pagtratrabaho at karunungan sa pakikisalamuha sa iba’t-ibang tao ang ating mga kabataan.”Sinimulang ipatupad ng Taguig ang programang SPES noong 2011 at nakatulong na ito sa halos 5,000 na kabataan ngayong 2016.Upang mapabilang sa programa, ang aplikante ay dapat nasa edad na 15-25 years old.
