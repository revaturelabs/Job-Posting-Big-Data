This year’s theme is all about “Recruiting Reimagined.” In today’s fiercely competitive talent market, the companies that recruit successfully are the ones that constantly find ways to innovate, optimize, and stand out from the crowd. At this year’s Summit, we’ll inspire you to reimagine every stage of the recruiting funnel—from hello to hire.We are thrilled to welcome Guy Kawasaki as our Summit ‘16 keynote speaker. An entrepreneur, evangelist, bestselling author and in-demand speaker, Guy will share the keys to unlocking “The Art of Enchantment” with our Summit audience. In a talk based on his New York Times bestselling book, Guy argues that enchantment has the ability to transform situations and relationships, turning skeptics into believers and the undecided into the loyal. Done right, enchantment is more powerful than persuasion, influence or marketing techniques. You won’t want to miss this opportunity to learn how you can reimagine your recruiting and enchant top talent.Summit ‘16 is packed with insightful presentations from Jobvite leaders, including CEO Dan Finnigan, and industry thought leaders, including Kris Dunn from Fistful of Talent. These sessions promise to take your recruiting and talent acquisition to the next level. Choose your learning experience in our Day 1 Deep Dive Workshops, and connect with your peers during breakouts and networking sessions. With insightful keynotes and in-depth sessions, we’ll redefine what it means to be on the cutting edge in today’s market. You’ll walk away ready to revitalize your recruiting plan, captivate candidates, and hire smarter.For a sneak preview of what you can expect at the Summit, check out these highlights from Summit ‘15.
