The best daytime TV is the kind where you listen before you talk, and with my partners at Disney/ABC, that’s what we’ll deliver next fall!”View this post on Instagram#TamCam coming in a few but first, thank you #TeamTamron.

My new partners appreciate and respect the relationship I’ve built with my audience and know that if we create television worth watching, they’ll join us for the ride. I’m so grateful and excited for this next chapter. The landing makes the leap of faith so worth it!A post shared by Tamron Hall (@tamronhall) on Aug 8, 2018 at 12:17pm PDT“We’re excited to bring Tamron Hall to our ABC Owned Stations next fall and are confident she’ll be a unique and welcome voice in daytime,” Wendy McMahon, president of ABC Owned Television Stations Group, added in the statement. “Tamron is refreshingly authentic and approachable. She genuinely cares about people, their struggles and their triumphs. We know she’ll connect with our audiences in a personal and positive way.”News first broke in early August that Tamron was working on bringing her own daytime talk show to TV. “I’m so thrilled to partner with Disney/ABC to create a daytime television show that’s unconventional, fun, intimate, and sometimes even raw,” Tamron said at the time. “My new partners appreciate and respect the relationship I’ve built with my audience and know that if we create television worth watching, they’ll join us for the ride. I’m so grateful and excited for this next chapter. The landing makes the leap of faith so worth it!”View this post on InstagramNo cold shoulders in #Chicago just warm hugs. So good to be back #sweethomechicagoA post shared by Tamron Hall (@tamronhall) on Sep 23, 2018 at 4:08pm PDTDisney/ABC couldn’t be happier to have her on board as well. “We are incredibly excited to partner with Tamron and look forward to bringing a fresh, new daytime talk show to stations across the country that will showcase her enormous talent and dynamic personality,” Janice Marinelli, president of Global Content Sales and Distribution, Direct-to-Consumer and International of The Walt Disney Company, said.William Burton, Senior Vice President of ABC Daytime, added, “Tamron’s wealth of experience and unique perspective is needed in today’s daytime landscape. We look forward to developing a daily destination showcasing her spirit, boundless enthusiasm, and powerful ability to engage with viewers.”This news comes months after Weinstein Television announced that the network was giving Tamron a new job as a daytime talk show host. However, following the sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein and his subsequent firing, the status of the project had remained unclear for some time.Getty ImagesThe program was reportedly set to feature Tamron in front of a live studio audience. She was also allegedly set to serve as an executive producer on the upcoming series and work with The Weinstein Company to create additional non-scripted programming. The new talk show would focus on current events, human interest stories, and celebrity interviews. “I’ve been working towards developing a talk show for a long time, but needed to make sure I did it the right way and with the right person to take the lead,” Harvey said at the time, according to People.In February 2017, Tamron surprisingly announced she was leaving Today after nearly three years. “Yesterday was [Tamron’s] last day as an anchor on both [NBC and MSNBC]. Tamron is an exceptional journalist, we valued and enjoyed her work at Today and MSNBC and hoped that she would decide to stay. We are disappointed that she has chosen to leave, but we wish her all the best,” a statement from NBC read.“The last 10 years have been beyond anything I could have imagined, and I’m grateful,” Tamron said in a statement. “I’m also very excited about the next chapter. To all my great colleagues, I will miss you and I will be rooting for you.”We’re not surprised that Tamron has finally announced her big gig either. In late 2017, Us Weekly reported that Tamron was ready for a big TV comeback. “Tamron and her team have been pitching a talk show for her,” an insider shared. “They think it could be big.” Congrats on your new job, Tamron — we can’t wait to watch!Join our Facebook Group for the latest news and updates on the Today show!Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Tags:co-hostsshowsTamron HallToday Showtv newsMore in Reality TVMegyn Kelly Is Reportedly Feuding With New 'Today' Face Craig MelvinSavannah Guthrie Reveals She Has Not Seen Matt Lauer Since His 'Today' FiringKathie Lee Gifford's Colleagues Are Petitioning for Her to Get a Star on the Hollywood Walk of FameTop storiesRobin Roberts Gives Update on Amber Laign 1 Week After Father DiedMartin Lawrence Has 3 Kids He's Proud Of — Meet His Grown DaughtersChanging It Up!
