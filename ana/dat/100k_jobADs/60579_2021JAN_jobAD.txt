"Business Evolutionist: Job HuntingBusiness Evolutionist« Carnival of the Capitalists | Main | Love is the Killer App »June 07, 2004Job HuntingI'm charting some new territory here... unemployment...In the past 14 years I've changed jobs a few times, each one has been the result of being recruited or a referral so I'm sort of new to job hunting.Suggestions welcome... as well as job offers! ;-)I've worked on a lot of VERY diverse and cool projects through the years... I'm a true generalist: I've been involved in several business process design/reengineering projects. I was involved in Internet Strategy/Marketing for a Fortune 500 company. I've managed projects. I'm a Certified Java Programmer (Ive designed and built NUMEROUS applications). Built two development teams. Written numerous articles (and a book). Etc.My recent posts about IDEO and The Origins of Unengaged Employees take on a whole new meaning to me right now. As I look online at job postings I'm amazed at the narrow focus of most of the job descriptions. The trouble for me, I think, is that people are going to look at my diverse skills and question the depth of them. Don't get me wrong, I could create a specialized resume for each position, but then I'm not telling the whole truth, nor would I be very happy doing one thing and only thing for an extended period of time.... unless of course I'm really into the purpose of the business and/or the \"thing\" I'm doing is creative in nature.Ah, who knows... The West Wing - The Complete Second Season was just released on DVD... perhaps I'll get it and just hang out and watch that all day... NAH. I'd get terribly bored, very quickly.Several opportunities have already presented themselves - one in particular that really interests me.Anyway, I really wasn't sure about blogging this... but what the heck. I figured that sharing it might help explain what might be coming out of my keyboard in the next couple of posts as I'm deciding my future.Posted by Jon Strande at 03:47 PM in Personal | PermalinkCommentsEver thought about becoming an entrepreneur?Just curious =°)Posted by: Philipp Schumann | June 07, 2004 at 07:34 PMPhil, yes indeed! I'm thinking VERY seriously about it. There are actually three things I'm considering right now... which I'm sure I'll be blogging about in the coming days.Do you have some thoughts about it?JonPosted by: Jon Strande | June 07, 2004 at 07:59 PMDo post them, I'm ever so curious.Now I know you need to be careful with that kind of stuff, I'm myself planning something I won't tell anyone about until the launch :)But isn't it just great to have something in the pipeline...?Looking forward to seeing what you're up to, though, and a special thank you for the book summaries. Great for poor students who don't have the time and funds to actually read them in full.On another note, I just read your \"The Origins of Unengaged Employees\" post but the comment feature wasn't available. I was just gonna add that I believe that the overall \"mentality\" of a company -- something that to a great deal is (co)shaped by its (co)founder(s) -- has a great influence on \"staff engagement\". I think most people are by nature highly interested in making sense of their making-a-living, and thus blossom in places where they can contribute their individual skills to a \"vision\" they can identify with. Unfortunately, lots of companies are still soo 20th century, and thus their main vision is either shareholder value, market leadership, or profits. Or all. Naturally, people get easily bored by such a single-minded approach, and that's where engagement ends. Just my point of view, though. I guess Google can be regarded as an interesting proof of this concept.Best regards,PhilPosted by: Philipp Schumann | June 07, 2004 at 08:25 PMHum, a comment-edit feature would be useful.Where I said:<< Now I know you need to be careful with that kind of stuff, I'm myself planning something I won't tell anyone about until the launch >>it would be fairer to also mention that a friend and me are actually planning this together. :)Sorry for stuffing your blog with stuff like this, try to keep my posts short.Posted by: Philipp Schumann | June 07, 2004 at 08:28 PMSomething will present it self.If I were a manager I would hire a talent person such as you in a second.Let me know if I can help.ChuckPosted by: Chuck Conway | June 08, 2004 at 03:07 AMPhil, no need to apologize! Like most bloggers I enjoy comments, especially good ones! ;-) My pleasure on the book summaries. Writing them helped me retain the information, sharing them is a bonus. I appreciate you thanking me for them.Chuck, thank you! I really appreciate it!!Posted by: Jon Strande | June 08, 2004 at 06:09 AMJon,regarding job searches; is there any way that you can link these experiences with a common thread? That's what employers are looking for. I don't think that polyvalence is a problem for employers as long as you can show what they will think is some sort of a 'logical' path. I would have thought that the cover letter is the best place for that, followed of course by the interview.Have you tried a themed CV? That's something that can work in France, a place where people are pigeon-holed professionally very easily and 'generalists' aren't necessarily very well seen. That might allow you to group diverse experiences together more easily (for the recruiter).Good luck, whatever you do!ChristopherPosted by: Christopher Grove | June 08, 2004 at 06:48 AMChristopher - thank you! Yes, most of my experience has been directly linked to IT. For instance, I was one of only two IT employees at a $300 million dollar Consumer Packaged Goods company that was part of the business process redesign and ERP selection team. My job was to translate the business needs into functional requirements for the proposed system.Posted by: Jon Strande | June 08, 2004 at 07:07 AMHmmm... as someone who had his fair share of career downtime after 9-11... here's what worked for me:1. Imagine your dream job.2. Mentally break your dream job into 4-6 distinct parts.3. Narrow your focus of your blog to just these 4-6 distinct parts. Create them as official categories, if you have to.4. Blog like crazy about them.5. If you're any good (I'm assuming you are) eventually somebody interesting will get a whiff of it, and invite you to scatter your pollen throughout their company in exchange for decent money, as opposed to doing it for free in the 'sphere.6. Yes, they'll in all likelihood expect to reign you in a bit; expect you to save your best ideas for them, and only give out the B-Grades to your blog readers etc etc.Whether that's a fair deal (it is to me) I can't decide for you.Posted by: hugh macleod | June 08, 2004 at 12:43 PMHugh,Your advice is great and your B material is also excellent!Posted by: Mike | June 08, 2004 at 03:15 PMI'm about to re-enter the job market myself. It's a royal pain in the ass. Starting a business is a lot more fun; the problem is finding the cash to live on while the business gears up.Good luck!Posted by: fiat lux | June 08, 2004 at 09:48 PMHugh, yes, great advice indeed!!!! Thank you!Fiat, Yeah, starting a business would be more fun... but money being what it is... [/grin]. Actually, money is only a partial concern with me, the thing I really want to do - take over the world - has a really long sales cycle. LOL!!! ;-)Best of luck in your search - let me know if there is ANYTHING that I can do to help!Posted by: Jon Strande | June 09, 2004 at 06:06 AMThe comments to this entry are closed.The Best OfManaging the Total Customer LifetimeThe Origins of Unengaged EmployeesIDEO?
