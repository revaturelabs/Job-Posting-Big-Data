We have a professional duty to provide an unbiased and objective view, and we report and advise.

All programmes take 3 years to complete; they just offer different routes to achieving success. Our Empowered Programme offers you the chance to work and study near your KPMG office and follow blended work experience and study (classroom and online learning) towards ACA or CA (Scotland) qualification - local to your home office location. Some travel will be required for work and exams will be spread out over the 3 year programme.Like the organisations we work with, we're having to adapt.

The programme uses innovative technology and is delivered via a blend of Online Classroom Live and Recorded courses plus in-centre classroom courses. This blended approach enables you to study and learn the content at a pace suited to your learning style, but ensures all are at the right technical level prior to stepping into revision elements so you can focus on your exam technique before the exam. The structure of the programme spreads the ACA examinations over the lifetime of the 3 year training contract so that you are able to build up your technical knowledge, and can gradually apply what you are learning in training to your workplace experience. Regardless of the ACA programme route you choose both have wrap around support which consists of dedicated professional coaches, online portal content and live and recorded additional study sessions, which means there is a form of support for your every need.For those joining an office in Scotland we offer the ICAS (CA) - both the tuition provider and the professional body which means they both create and teach the material you require to gain the relevant knowledge expected for their syllabus. The programme consists of classroom-based tuition and revision, with wrap-around online and self-study learning. The training is block release which means you are out of the business for 4 to 8 week periods at a time enabling you to focus solely on your professional qualification and then go back into the business once complete. The structure of the programme requires you to take ownership of your studies but also provides a good balance, allowing you to shape your own learning and seek support as and when you need it. The structure of the programme spreads the CA examinations over the lifetime of the 3 year training contract, so that you are able to build up your technical knowledge, and can gradually apply what you are learning in training to your workplace experience.The impact of COVID-19 on professional qualifications:The vast majority of KPMG's staff undertaking a professional qualification were able to continue with their studies and examinations following the COVID-19 pandemic, including those studying with the ICAEW and ICAS. We expect studies to be back to our usual mix of classroom and remote learning detailed above for our 2021 intake, and exams to be scheduled normally.Extra informationStatusOpenLocationBirminghamType of ContractGraduate InternshipPublished at13-01-2021Profession Sub-categoryAccountancyFull UK/EU driving license preferredNoCar PreferredNoMust be eligible to work in the EUNoCover Letter RequiredNoBirmingham | Accountancy jobs | Graduate InternshipApply nowAlso possible without CV and motivational letter!Apply nowAlso possible without CV and motivational letter!Get similar vacancies sent to your mailboxFill in below which area you are searching in for a similar function and don't forget your e-mail address!< 10 km < 25 km < 50 km < 100 kmProfession TypeProfession Type Accountancy Admin / Secretarial Advertising / Marketing / PR Advice Bar Staff / Waiters and Waitresses Counselling and Social Services Customer Service Design / Fashion Engineering Health / Medical Home Care Human Resources ICT Legal Logistics jobs Management Manufacturing / Industrial Online Marketing Project Management Promotions Receptionist Retail Sales Scientific Services Secretary Security / Stewarding Sport / Adventure Teaching / Instructors / Guides Technical TrainingType of ContractType of Contract Casual / Part Time Jobs Evening Job Full Time Jobs Graduate Internship Graduate Jobs Internships Placements Summer / Holiday Jobs Temporary Full Time Voluntary Weekend Work from homeSave alertRelated vacanciesInsight Placement Black Heritage Talent - Technology Insight Birmingham TBC 2021Graduate Audit ACA / CA - Empowered Birmingham Autumn 2021Graduate Consulting - Financial Transformation Birmingham Autumn 2021Graduate Technology - Digital Consulting Birmingham Autumn 2021Graduate Technology - Financial Modelling Birmingham Autumn 2021Share this vacancyNot what you are looking for?
