The ability to listen to and understand information and ideas presented through spoken words and sentences.Deductive Reasoning . The ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.Inductive Reasoning . The ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events).Oral Expression . The ability to communicate information and ideas in speaking so others will understand.Problem Sensitivity . The ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong.

The ability to make precisely coordinated movements of the fingers of one or both hands to grasp, manipulate, or assemble very small objects.Control Precision . The ability to quickly and repeatedly adjust the controls of a machine or a vehicle to exact positions.Rate Control . The ability to time your movements or the movement of a piece of equipment in anticipation of changes in the speed and/or direction of a moving object or scene.Response Orientation . The ability to choose quickly between two or more movements in response to two or more different signals (lights, sounds, pictures). It includes the speed with which the correct response is started with the hand, foot, or other body part.Multilimb Coordination . The ability to coordinate two or more limbs (for example, two arms, two legs, or one leg and one arm) while sitting, standing, or lying down. It does not involve performing the activities while the whole body is in motion.Reaction Time . The ability to quickly respond (with the hand, finger, or foot) to a signal (sound, light, picture) when it appears.Wrist-Finger Speed . The ability to make fast, simple, repeated movements of the fingers, hands, and wrists.Manual Dexterity . The ability to quickly move your hand, your hand together with your arm, or your two hands to grasp, manipulate, or assemble objects.Spatial Orientation . The ability to know your location in relation to the environment or to know where other objects are in relation to you.Trunk Strength . The ability to use your abdominal and lower back muscles to support part of the body repeatedly or continuously over time without 'giving out' or fatiguing.Dynamic Flexibility . The ability to quickly and repeatedly bend, stretch, twist, or reach out with your body, arms, and/or legs.Dynamic Strength . The ability to exert muscle force repeatedly or continuously over time. This involves muscular endurance and resistance to muscle fatigue.Explosive Strength .
