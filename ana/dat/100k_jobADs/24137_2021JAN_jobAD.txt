The rate of revenue collected in the IT and Legal sectors have taken a nosedive this year. This is another economic effect of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID). Many law school graduates still remain in a state of limbo as top law firms have seen pay cuts, layoffs, and furloughs.With the promise of a vaccine near, there are some bright spots that point to economic recovery. One boost has come from law firms with strong labor and employment practices as their clients navigate cutting jobs and addressing workplace safety issues. There is a trend towards growth as the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the legal industry added 1,900 jobs in July.During these uncertain times, employees attempting to move on to new jobs may be subject to “generous” counteroffers from their current employers. However, as the adage goes, appearances can be deceiving.Especially in light of the pandemic, most employers with any interest in pulling themselves out of the current downturn in revenue will try to retain you with a moderately attractive counteroffer. This tactic may be to buy themselves time.The counteroffer is more so for the employer’s interests than it is for you. If your employer valued you and you were satisfied with your wage and the work environment, you would not have looked elsewhere for employment. Remember, a counteroffer is not a solid promise.Consider these five reasons why you should reject a counteroffer:1. Your increase may have been a future raise.If a raise is offered as part of your counteroffer, take into consideration that all firms have budgets with wage guidelines. The increase included in your counteroffer may represent your future raise granted early. Translated this means you will have to wait longer to see another increase.2. Counteroffers may create a toll on your work relationships.If you accept your employer’s counteroffer and remain at your current position you may face alienation from the company’s culture. On a ground level, your coworkers may see you as disloyal and no longer a part of the team. In their eyes, you tried to leave them.3. The same issues may resurface.If the reason you decided to move on from your employment was any issue other than money, then your dissatisfaction may return after the glow of your pay raise fades. Also, if the corporate culture changes promised in your counteroffer do not last, you will soon be back to job hunting.4. You may have stunted your ability to be promoted.No matter what, if you accept a counteroffer, your credibility and reputation within the organization will fundamentally change. Your manager will always question your loyalty as you will be seen as a dissatisfied employee or “the one who wanted to leave.” This may cause you to be passed over for future promotions or important projects.5. Counteroffers may narrow your job options in the future.If you make it through a company’s hiring process only to turn around and accept your current employer’s counteroffer, you should not expect the prospective employer to ever consider you for a position again. Also, realize that the legal community is smaller than you think.When evaluating an employer’s counteroffer it’s important to remove your ego from the equation. Be clear on the issues are that caused you to seek a new job in the first place and evaluate the counteroffer from that perspective. Unless the counteroffer addresses all of the reasons why you considered leaving in the first place, it’s best to move on. Even if the counteroffer does address all your issues, there are always drawbacks to consider.Strategic Recruitment Solutions has been matching top companies with top talent in the Gulf Region for more than a decade.

Workplace satisfaction is an integral part of retaining and recruiting new employees and growing a business or firm. Employers face some challenges in that the motivating factors for workplace satisfaction seem to differ radically between younger and older generations, but now they have the data to follow through with addressing these needs.Positive WordsStatistics suggest that employees between the ages of 21 to 30 partially depend on managerial praise and recognition to be fully satisfied. Of this demographic, 30 percent would “strongly” recommend their workplace as a satisfactory environment. Of this younger age group, 39 percent agree that their manager/supervisor puts forward the maximum effort to recognize their achievements.Workplace PerformanceWhile younger workers want positive words, older workers want their performance measured. Parallel to this, data suggests that the older the worker, the more satisfied. There is a correlation between an increase in age and in incremental satisfaction. Senior citizens are the most satisfied workers, reporting a 95 percent satisfaction rate. Of employees between the age of 61-70, 47 percent would “strongly” recommend their workplace to others.Two PerspectivesThere are two different perspectives on satisfaction due to age in the workplace. For a business to be successful, there is a need to address both age groups. Not only will this have the effect of creating a more productive working environment, but it will also help retain workers.Strategic Recruitment Solutions has been matching top companies with top talent in the Gulf Region for more than a decade.

You certainly want to be pleasant and congenial, but what should you do if you are asked a question that you believe is inappropriate or one that makes you feel uncomfortable?IT’S THE LAWThe US Labor Department division of Labor/Employee Relations website reminds employers that “it is illegal not to hire candidates because of their race, color, sex, religion, national origin, birthplace, age, disability or marital/family status.” Interviewers should not ask you questions that would elicit such information. However, even though most employers are aware of the law, prepare your answers to these questions:Do you have a disability?The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides protections for disabled employees and job applicants. You do not have to answer a question regarding your disability unless you choose to disclose it. If you have an obvious disability (for example, you require a wheelchair) or if you choose to disclose your disability, your interviewer is allowed to ask what, if any, special requirements you need to fulfill the job requirements.What’s your age?If you are 40 years or older, you are protected against age discrimination by the Employment Act (ADEA). It is against the law for the interviewer to ask your age. Interviewers have the right to ask if a job candidate is 18 or older (verifying legal adult status) if this is an important factor in the candidate’s ability to do the job.Marital statusWhile it’s irrelevant and illegal to ask this during the interview, employers can ask this question for insurance purposes.Do you have children?Your interviewer should not ask you whether or not you have children. However, your employer has the right to ask questions about your dependents for insurance purposes.What’s your race?Any questions that inquire about your ethnic or racial identity are not allowed during the interview. You may be required to answer questions about your race or ethnic identity on your employer’s insurance forms.Can you tell us about your nearest relative or next of kin? This is a question your interviewer should avoid asking. It is appropriate for your employer to ask once you are hired because this information is needed to provide you with employee benefits.Are you a U.S. citizen?Your interviewer is allowed to ask whether you are legally eligible to work in the United States (i.e., do you have a temporary visa, a green card, or citizenship). However, it is prohibited to ask direct questions about your national origin or immigration status.Have you ever filed for bankruptcy?Your interviewer cannot ask you whether you ever filed for bankruptcy or any questions about your financial status. Your employer may ask for financial information as it relates to your employee benefits.HOW TO RESPOND TO ILLEGAL INTERVIEW QUESTIONSWhat are your options in this situation? Here are a few suggestions:Briefly answer the question, or if you are uncomfortable in doing so, respond to the intent of the question;Ignore the question and change the subject; orRefuse to answer the question.It is best to be tactful but firm. Prepare your answers to these questions in advance by focusing on how to reply without disclosing any personal information.DISCLOSING PERSONAL INFORMATION IS YOUR CHOICEWhen the interviewer asks if you have any questions, this is your opportunity to decide what to self-disclose. For example, if you needed a specific accommodation for your disability or want to know about maternity leave.If you choose NOT to disclose any personal information, you may come across as secretive. Disclosing too much information may make you appear “needy and high maintenance.” A recruiter can help prepare you for the interview, especially how much to disclose and how.INAPPROPRIATE INTERVIEW QUESTIONSBizarre, inappropriate interview questions are another topic altogether. These are the questions that are not illegal. However, they make you think about the interviewer’s intentions. Questions that relate to your sexual orientation, personal relationships, political affiliation, or beliefs are off-limits.Strategic Recruitment Solutions has been matching top companies with top talent in the Gulf Region for more than a decade.

After you practice your responses to a list of the most common legal competency-based questions, you must make sure you don’t miss this critical component to your next interview. Whether your interview is virtual or in-person, your body language could be the key to helping you get the job.Professor Albert Mehrabian did extensive research into the impact of our verbal and nonverbal communication. In his communication model, he identified three key points regarding body language:55 percent of the message you communicate relates to your body language and facial expression;38 percent of the message you communicate relates to the tone of your voice and your manner of speech; andOnly 7 percent of your message relates to the words we communicate.From unconscious fidgeting to awkward facial expressions, our nervousness in an interview can easily lead to a host of body language mistakes.So here some suggestions on how to improve your body language:MAINTAIN EYE CONTACTOne of the biggest mistakes you can make during your job interview is to avoid eye contact with your interviewer. Hiring managers want to see the confidence in their prospective candidates, and keeping your vision cast down towards the floor makes you look nervous and lack confidence. Though this can be a part of your personality, it’s something you need to consider and address.Make sure you look at your interviewer as you answer their questions and show you are actively listening and engaged in the conversation.THE BODY LANGUAGE OF A SMILENot only can smiling make you appear warm and friendly, but it may also help you with your interview-based nerves. Employers want to hire someone who has a pleasant manner and fits into a legal firm’s culture.LIMIT YOUR HAND GESTURESAlthough you may gesture with your hands with your friends and family, it is best to keep hand gestures to a minimum during your job interview.Moving your hands around can be distracting, especially on a zoom job interview.UNCROSS YOUR ARMSThough you might think this doesn’t happen anymore in an interview situation, however, surprisingly it still does. Remember, especially in an interview situation, crossed arms may be seen as a sign that you are disengaged, bored, or even worse – defensive.By keeping the frame of your body open and angled towards the interviewer, you can portray interest and engagement with your body language,KEEP YOUR BODY POSTURE STRAIGHTSitting with a bad posture will not help you appear confident. Make sure you sit up straight, with spine straight against the back of your chair, and square off your shoulders. A strong posture helps you look more like a leader.Strategic Recruitment Solutions has been matching top companies with top talent in the Gulf Region for more than a decade.

If you are thinking of changing jobs, you need to share your full job history with your legal or IT recruiter. The more they know, the more they will be able to help you find your dream job.Recruiters should know:1. Recruiters should know about all your prior jobs, even the ones not listed on your resumeDid you know that 78 percent of job seekers lie on their resume! For the most part, this applies to positions post-college. You should reveal every position you’ve held, even if for a short time. At best, you will appear to be a well-rounded candidate who has the ability to work in a variety of roles. At worst, it avoids the possibility of leaving something in your work history that may come back later to haunt you.2. Tell your Recruiter the truth about why you are leaving your current jobEmployers will always want the answer to this question. Tell your recruiter the truth about the circumstances that led you to consider changing jobs. If you choose not to share the “real” reason at your interview, your recruiter can help you answer the question in a way that puts you in your best light. It may help to make a list of pros and cons regarding your current job: what are the positives and what are the negatives? This information is invaluable in your recruiter’s hands for assisting you in finding the best job for you. He or she will help you avoid toxic environments that pushed you to move on from your current job in the first place.3. Recruiters need to know what salary you have in mindAdvocate for yourself in terms of salary. If you have a minimum salary requirement, tell your recruiter! Not only will this help you find a job with the right compensation it will also save everyone time. Once you let your recruiter know what you want, the prospective positions can be narrowed down to find the best fit for you.Strategic Recruitment Solutions has been matching top companies with top talent in the Gulf Region for more than a decade.
