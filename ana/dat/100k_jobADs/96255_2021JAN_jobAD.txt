Not only does wearing the wrong bra affect the way you look, but it can also cause other problems like neck and shoulder pain, backaches, tingling in the arms, rashes and chafing, fibrocystic breasts, and skin abrasions.At Breakout Bras, we offer something called the 10 Minute Boob Job. That means our friendly, experienced fitters can pin down your correct bra size within your first 10 minutes in our fitting room.STEP 1: ASSESSMENTYour perfect fit is more than just a number! That's why our fitters don't use a tap measure to fit you. Instead, we take into account many factors, such as the length of your torso, the shape of your ribcage, where you carry the most fullness in your breasts, and more.This way, we can find the styles that work best for you and your body.STEP 2: TESTNext, we take all those things we considered in the first step to pick out some styles. The goal of this step is to find a good starting point that we can build upon.Collectively, our fitters have more than 50 years of professional sizing experience, and they will use that knowledge to choose styles that are most likely to work for your body.Once you try on a few test styles, we can take note of what works and what doesn't. Then it's time to move on to the next step.STEP 3: ADJUSTFinally, it's time to adjust the fit until it's perfect.Is the band firm enough to give you adequate support? Are the wires back far enough to completely encompass your breasts? Are you falling out the top or the bottom of the cups? Are your straps digging in or sliding off?Our fitters will check all these major points and ensure that we have you in the correct size, all within your first 10 minutes in our store!﻿Congratulations!
