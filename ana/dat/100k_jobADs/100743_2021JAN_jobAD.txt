Regrettably, many qualified applicants are never considered as a result of their gender, religious views, age or racial background, and it is essential for victims who experience discrimination while applying for a job to hold hiring managers and companies accountable for their actions.In fact, discrimination during the hiring process is often especially devastating for those who desperately need a job or spend a considerable amount of time and resources to pursue a particular position.Looking at examples of discrimination during the hiring processAccording to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, it is against the law for employers to discriminate against job applicants because of their religion, sexual orientation, age (if they are over 40), race or gender identity. Discrimination takes various forms during the hiring process, whether an employer fails to provide reasonable accommodations to help a disabled job applicant, an applicant is required to take an unfair test or an application is rejected solely because of one’s gender or race.Looking at the impact of discrimination for applicantsIf you experience discrimination while applying for a job, you could face multiple challenges. Finding lucrative positions has become increasingly difficult, and many people become hopeless or give up due to bad experiences. Depression and anxiety are a problem for some victims, as well as financial hardships. Companies that fail to respect the right of workers and job applicants must answer for these violations.FacebookTwitterLinkedInSearch for:Recent PostsJob applicants and unlawful discriminationWhat does the FMLA mean for you?UPS eases appearance restrictionsWhat are Qui Tam Actions?How to stop sexual harassment without losing your jobArchivesJanuary 2021December 2020November 2020October 2020September 2020August 2020July 2020June 2020May 2020April 2020March 2020January 2020November 2019October 2019September 2019August 2019June 2019May 2019CategoriesFirm NewsUncategorizedRSS FeedSubscribe To This Blog’s FeedLoading...Set Up An Initial Consultation TodayOffice LocationThe Foster Group902 W.
