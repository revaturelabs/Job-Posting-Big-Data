Sunday, January 24th, 2021QHC board approves draft planAdministrator | Nov 19, 2015 | Comments 0NOV. 25 – UPDATE – QHC board members approved the draft 2016-2017 operating plan in principle. Changes are possible as the corporation and unions continue meeting in December. Final approval is expected in January for implementation in April.* * *NOV. 19 – Quinte Health Care (QHC) employees are awaiting word on job losses and changes.QHC needs to remove $11.5 million in expenses next year in order to operate within reduced funding levels and cover inflation. This includes a $7 million reduction in administration/support departments and $4.5 million in patient care areas, said Susan Rowe, Senior Director, Communications, QHC, in a release Thursday morning.President and CEO Mary Clare Egberts said there are some changes to clinical services and access to care across the hospitals, but the vast majority of the proposed changes for 2016/17 are related to staffing levels and efficiencies in almost every area of QHC.If the proposed changes are fully implemented, there would be 84 fewer positions at QHC.The release explains the proposed changes would eliminate 162 positions and add 78 new positions. Of the 162 positions, 38 are already vacant. Of the 78 new positions, 48 can be used for automatic reassignments and the remaining 30 can be used for other reassignment opportunities or job postings.“These changes are extremely difficult for everyone at QHC and we are focused on supporting our staff through this stressful process,” said Egberts. “Unfortunately it is not possible to remove another $11.5 million from our organization without reducing the number of staff positions, but as always, our goal is to manage this as much as possible through attrition, retirements and offering different positions where possible so that we can minimize the number of valued staff who need to leave QHC involuntarily.”On Nov. 24, the QHC Board of Directors will consider the proposed operating plan for approval in principal, subject to any changes from the union staff planning process. Final Board approval is to be in January 2016. The changes would then start to be implemented in April 2016.“The unions meetings this week are part of the continuing process and we are sharing information as we have it,” said Egberts.The process to identify the savings began in May and included two phases of community engagement with input gathered from more than 1,500 people.“Community members told us in the spring that their top priorities for hospital care were 24-hour emergency rooms, inpatient beds and basic diagnostics,” said Tricia Anderson, QHC Board Chair. “We have been able to commit to keeping these key services close-to-home.”TweetFiled Under: Local NewsAbout the Author:Comments (0)Trackback URLComments are closed.RECENT COMMENTSSM on Requests for First Nations’ consultations delays Quinte’s Isle planning meetingMike Rodgers on Requests for First Nations’ consultations delays Quinte’s Isle planning meetingTed Norris on Requests for First Nations’ consultations delays Quinte’s Isle planning meetingChuck on Requests for First Nations’ consultations delays Quinte’s Isle planning meetingDon Montgomery on Requests for First Nations’ consultations delays Quinte’s Isle planning meetingArchivesArchives Select Month January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010Countylive.caHOME LOCAL MARKETPLACE COMMUNITY CONTACT US© Copyright Prince Edward County News countylive.ca 2021 • All rights reserved."
