"Handjob SecretsHandjob SecretsFeel sexy & naughty with these powerful hand secrets during an erotic handjob or to amplify the ultimate blowjob.Most men love handjobs.Handjobs have the unfortunate reputation of being the ugly stepsister of the blowjob. But a handjob has its place.Most men love handjobs. What men don't love are bad handjobs. After all...when you think about it...it is how they give themselves pleasure.A man loves a woman who craves pleasure and takes matters into her own hands...literally.Familiarize yourself with your man's penis by touching it. Feel where the head of his penis meets the shaft. Feel the texture of each part of his penis.Your hands don't tire out as quickly as your mouth does. That makes an erotic handjob a good warm up act for a blowjob.Giving your man an erotic handjob is a great way to learn how much pressure he likes on his penis. It's easier to apply pressure with your hand than with your mouth.Add to the fun by helping him to take it all off.Lube It UpWater based or silicone lube works for a handjob.Make sure his penis is always nice and wet during a handjob. Don't let your hands get dry. Dry friction feels uncomfortable and can cause chafing.Your hand should slip and slide up and down his penis...not pull the skin off.Just about any sex lube will be fine for a handjob. But don't use warming or stimulating lubes or gels...or anything with menthol.System JO H2O Water Based (2.5 oz. $6) is my favorite basic lubricant. If it dries out a bit during action you can add water and it gets slippery again. It also doesn't get tacky or sticky. It washes off easily and doesn't stain.Aqua SexThe shower is a perfect place to deliver the ultimate handjob. Don't forget the silicone lubricant for a handjob in the shower. Water based lube...as well as natural lubrication...will just wash away in the water.You'll want to be generous with the lubricant...but you don't want to use too much. Too much lube means that you can't get enough friction. That means you will do twice the work for half the result.Be generous with the lube during a handjob.To apply lubricant...pour a little in the palms of your hands and rub them together. This also helps to warm both your hands and the lube to body temperature.Or place your hand over his penis with your fingertips resting lightly on his scrotum. Pour the lube over the back of your hand so that it trickles between your fingers.Take your time to apply lube with a sensual rub all over his shaft and testicles to add to the pleasure of the moment. Gently rub a bit of lube onto the head of his penis while you stroke his shaft with your other hand.For more hot handjob secrets...Explore the contents.Get yours now.Don't miss Handjob Positions for Ultimate Pleasure.Return to Top of PageTCBBusinessFor More Information...Subscribe 2 Secret DiaryFavorites MenuAbout MeTestimonialsContact MeFAQPrivacy PolicyPRODUCTSCourses & BooksHave it All ▼Books & Courses MenuComplete CollectionFree BonusesSeduce & Satisfy ▼BlowjobsHandjobsLapDance & StripTeaseErotic MassageSexy GamesSexy FilmsGift IdeasExperience Orgasms ▼Super Sex & OrgasmsQuickiesCunnilingusNo-Drama Relationships ▼Success with MenTalk SexySext TextForeplayPerfect KissARTICLESSexy SecretsBlowjob & Handjob MenuOrgasms & Intercourse MenuFantasy Sex & Seduction MenuMen & Relationships MenuMassage-LapDance-StripTease MenuFavorites MenuVIDEOSWatchBlowjob VideosHandjob VideosOrgasm & Intercourse VideosRelationships VideosYouTube ChannelAbout Ella ▼Contact MeAbout MeTestimonialsSite MapResources ▼CoursesYouTubeFAQGuaranteeYou must be 18 years or older to view this site.By entering this site you agree to the Privacy Policy - Terms and Conditions.Copyright@2010-2020 by Secrets2KeepHim.
