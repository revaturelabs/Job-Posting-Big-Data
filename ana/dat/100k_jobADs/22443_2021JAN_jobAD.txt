The Church requires parental consent and verification of the parent's identity before allowing children to create and activate a FamilySearch Account.What personal information will be collectedYour consent authorizes the Church to collect and store your child’s first and last name, date of birth, address, email address, and Church ward and stake or branch and district (if the child is a member of the Church), as well as your name and email address.This consent does not authorize the Church to collect any other personal information from your child. If any Church-affiliated website requires any additional personal information from your child, the website must first obtain parental approval.How personal information will be usedThe Church collects this personal information to verify your child’s identity when he or she creates a FamilySearch Account. After an account has been created, your child may use his or her FamilySearch Account username and password to access a variety of Church-affiliated Internet sites beyond publicly accessible sites such as ChurchofJesusChrist.org and ComeUntoChrist.org. This personal information is shared among affiliated websites when your child accesses those sites. Interactive features on these websites may allow your child to post messages to ward or general message boards; create an online profile; upload pictures, videos, or genealogical data; or otherwise create and share content that may be viewed by others.The Church may provide your child’s personal information to third parties that perform specific services on our behalf, such as payment processing, maintenance, security, data analysis, and hosting. In accordance with the Church’s Privacy Notice and industry standards, these parties are contractually required to protect your child’s personal information. They cannot use it in any other way (such as marketing) or share the information with anyone else.The Church may also use your child’s personal information for internal purposes, such as auditing, data analysis, system troubleshooting, and research. Such use will only identify statistical trends, and the results will only be reported in a general way, after all personally identifiable information has been removed.How to revoke consentAny parent or legal guardian who consented to his or her child’s registering for a FamilySearch Account may later revoke that consent and ask that the child’s account be removed. To revoke consent, click the following link to contact FamilySearch Account Support and provide the child’s first and last name, FamilySearch Account username, and Church record number (if the child is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints).<\",c,' onload=\"var d=',n,\";d.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].\",d,\"(d.\",g,\"('script')).\",i,\"='\",a.l,\"'\\\">\"].join(\"\")}var c=\"body\",e=h[c];if(!e)return setTimeout(q,100);a.P(1);var d=\"appendChild\",g=\"createElement\",i=\"src\",k=h[g](\"div\"),l=k[d](h[g](\"div\")),f=h[g](\"iframe\"),n=\"document\",p;k.style.display=\"none\";e.insertBefore(k,e.firstChild).id=o+\"-\"+j;f.frameBorder=\"0\";f.id=o+\"-frame-\"+j;/MSIE[ ]+6/.test(navigator.userAgent)&&(f[i]=\"javascript:false\");f.allowTransparency=\"true\";l[d](f);try{f.contentWindow[n].open()}catch(s){a.domain=h.domain,p=\"javascript:var d=\"+n+\".open();d.domain='\"+h.domain+\"';\",f[i]=p+\"void(0);\"}try{var r=f.contentWindow[n];r.write(b());r.close()}catch(t){f[i]=p+'d.write(\"'+b().replace(/\"/g,String.fromCharCode(92)+'\"')+'\");d.close();'}a.P(2)};a.l&&setTimeout(q,0)})()}();c[b].lv=\"1\";return c[b]}var o=\"lightningjs\",k=window[o]=g(o);k.require=g;k.modules=c}({}); window.usabilla_live = lightningjs.require(\"usabilla_live\", \"//w.usabilla.com/4e5ac7524142.js\"); /*]]>{/literal}*/AboutVolunteerBlogSite MapSolutions GalleryFeedbackLanguageFamilySearch Terms of Use (Updated 2019-12-10) | Privacy Notice (Updated 2018-09-01)© 2021 by Intellectual Reserve, Inc.
