Your Goals. What is DoorDash Available in over 4,000 cities in the U.S., Canada, and Australia, DoorDash is about connecting people with possibilities: bigger savings accounts, wider nets, stronger communities, and happier days. We empower local businesses and local drivers (called Dashers) with opportunities to earn, work, and live. As a Dasher , you can be your own boss and enjoy the flexibility of choosing when, where, and how much you earn. All you need is a mode of transportation and a smartphone to start making money. It's that simple. Why deliver with DoorDash Earn extra money for your goals: Achieve your short-term goals or long-term dreams by driving or biking with DoorDash. Choose your own hours: Unlike full-time jobs or seasonal gigs, when and where you work is totally up to you. Freedom to dash anywhere: Deliver near your home or in a city you're just visiting. Easy to get started: Don't worry about car inspections or vehicle restrictions. Just sign up and receive everything you need to start earning. Receive deliveries right away: Once approved, log on to the Dasher app to receive nearby orders immediately. Know how much you'll make: Clear and concise pay model lets you know how much you will make before accepting any order.
