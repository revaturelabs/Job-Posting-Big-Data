They will join six others who were successful in securing a role on the apprenticeship scheme following the first Movement to Work placement hosted by the business in June 2014.Ted Creighton, Head of Learning and Development at BAE Systems Submarines said: “The Movement to Work programme is an important initiative designed to tackle youth unemployment. As a result of two successful cohorts that we have hosted, we’ve found some real talent and have offered fifteen local people the opportunity to start a career and learn new skills.“I look forward to the new apprentices joining the business later this year and hope that the hands-on experience gained by the rest of group will help them to go on and achieve their career goals.”As part of the Movement to Work scheme, the groups also spent two weeks at Furness College learning other skills to help them gain employment and were invited to celebrate their experience at a dedicated event at the college.Robbie Gilmour, 18, from Barrow, completed his placement in the BAE Systems Submarines care and protection team in December and has since been offered a production services apprenticeship. Speaking of his time on the scheme he said: “Before taking part in the Movement to Work programme, I was fed up and I didn’t know what to do with my life. It’s been an amazing opportunity and I’ve loved every minute of it.“I couldn’t have done it without the great people that helped me through this process.”Notes to editors:Co-ordinated by the Prince’s Trust and launched by the Prime Minister in October 2013, the Movement to Work scheme is tackling the number of unemployed 16-24 year olds which stood at 965,000 at the beginning of 2014 – equivalent to 21% of young people in the UK. Under Movement to Work young people complete a four-week training programme including a two-week work placement provided by employers.Movement to Work aims to involve 100,000 young people by the end of 2015. BAE Systems aims to offer 100 work experience places this year at its UK based sites. In addition it is working with suppliers to encourage them to take part in the scheme.RSSPrintTwitterLatest updatesAccessibilityTerms & ConditionsPrivacyCookie policySitemapCookie SettingsCopyright © 2021 BAE Systems.
