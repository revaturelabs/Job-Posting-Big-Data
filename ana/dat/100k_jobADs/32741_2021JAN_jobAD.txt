On the 19//07/2016 I had to take it back to the branch for repair on blank screen. Hardly 14 days of purchase the phone showed lifeless on screen. The phoned was returned back around 3-4 weeks period and was returned, mid-late august. It only worked for 3 months. On the 12 december the phone was taken back to markham for rebooking. Precious from markham received the phone and as per wrong dated booking form which she claimed to have received the phone on the 16/01/2017 which is a complete lie she claimed that the handset had physical damage and on the day the handset was handed to her on the 12 december 2016 she examined the phone and confirm that there is no physical damage and indeed there was none. Now you are claiming that it was scratched. Your attached picture is claiming that unauthorised repair detected. No warranty seal in tact. According to my knowledge you are the first people to open the phone initially and might have not replaced the warranty seal as I am not a technician I cannot know much about that. Or maybe between you and your client markham under the sales of precious who not only lied about the condition of the phone but also lied about the date she received the phone someone has to take responsibility of this. On the 27/12/2016 she was contacted concerning the phone and she claimed that she has already send it through for repairs but the repair booking form is dated 16/01/2017. On the 17/02/2017 mobicel was contacted about the phone and the lady claimed that markham only book the phone on the 23/01/2017. Look at the time frame, lies and fraud included in documents and tell me what do I have to do. I would like a refund of r799.00 to be refunded back to my nedbank cheque account which was debited to contra the sale or a cash refund will do good for me. If not I need a replacement of the phone. The phone has only been used for 3 and half month - no wonder it was on sale by r500.00 which is equivalent to about 42%. I am currently waiting for my r799.00 cash back or replacement of the unit.RESOLVEDThe complaint has been investigated and resolved to the customer's satisfaction.Mobicel's response · Oct 02, 2019Dear Valued ClientWe do not offer or have ftp server to give anyone access too, we apologies for the inconvinience.Team#MOBIsquadMobicel's response · Jul 11, 2019Hi LindaKindly advise which model is it and also if the above has been resolved?Team#Mobisquad#Mobicel's response · Jul 11, 2019Hi Lindawe apologize for the inconvenience caused, kindly advise which device is it?Please send your response to [email protected] or alternatively call us on [protected] for prompt and efficient assistance.Team#MOBIsquad#Mobicel's response · Feb 02, 2018HiClient's device was assessed and water was detected on the device.We contacted the client and informed her and she instructed us to let it go therefore the device has been declared BER.ThanksMobicel's response · Feb 02, 2018HiThe device was assessed and liquid was detected on the device.
