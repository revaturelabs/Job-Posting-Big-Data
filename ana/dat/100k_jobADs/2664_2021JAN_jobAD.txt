Ernest and Young5 points | 25 comments | 1 month ago ago by [deleted] from personalfinance[deleted]Caleb_Krawdad |39 pointswritten 1 month ago agoSeems low but then again they're no Ernst & YoungEdit - in a series note, you don't go to the big 4 for a \"nice place to work\" you go to work your ass off, get great expertise and education, then sell out to a place that is nice to workc8080 |6 pointswritten 1 month ago agoThis is the comment I was looking for.Frozenlazer |9 pointswritten 1 month ago agoWhat kinda position is it? If that's in their consulting arm as a entry level consultant that seems way too low. Those jobs were paying like 45k when I was coming out of college 16 years ago in 2004. But salary data for those jobs is easy to find. They hire a small army every year.Mustangfast85 |1 pointwritten 1 month ago agoSimilar rememberance. $40k isn’t terrible but isn’t a bit considering how much grunt work is aheadVegasOldPerv |17 pointswritten 1 month ago agoMake certain this isn't a scam.Scammers like to use big name companies to make their victims feel safe. They're always advertised as remote jobs at first with potential transition to in-house and potential advancement to account executive level positions.Also, $800/wk is a favorite number scammers use. I don't know why. I guess it's in the middle, high enough to be interesting but not so high that it creates doubt.Basically you should try for an in-person interview. Call the E&Y location and ask for their HR Dept. Inquire if the position you are applying for is a valid offer.I hope it all works out for you. As to your question, it's experience with almost decent pay. Something to at least put on your resume for future job applications.Good luck.Gonebabythoughts |13 pointswritten 1 month ago agoYes, take it.As an international company, you will have opportunities for growth and advancement far outside the reach of that first job. But ask for $45k.[deleted] 1 month ago agoexconsultingguy |4 pointswritten 1 month ago agoIs this as like an admin assistant or something? Even for a fresh out of undergrad audit assistant position I’d expect to be over $50k. Hell when I started at Deloitte in advisory back in 2015 we all started at $68k with a $10k signing bonus.Regardless, EY is a solid place to launch your career and will open many doors. They’ll also work you like slave labor if you can’t build your credibility and stand up for yourself.Edit: also /r/consulting or /r/accounting for a more in-the-know crowd.Cromulus |3 pointswritten 1 month ago agoThat does seem quite a bit low. Is there a performance bonus, or is that a training period salary?t-poke |3 pointswritten 1 month ago agoThe only advice I have is to delete your post before someone at E&Y looks at your Reddit post history and rescinds your offer based off a couple posts I saw.Unless you think there are multiple 24 year old former luggage handlers who just got offered a $40k a year for a financial crimes analyst position in San Antonio and there’s no way they’d be able to link this to you specifically.swebs05 |2 pointswritten 1 month ago agoIf you’re working in the service delivery center you’re basically a lower cost consultant... in my experience at a big 4 for service delivery centers you will have (1) less upward mobility, not the traditional consultant path (2) lower pay than traditional consulting but expected to work just as much on projects (3) you have way less internal firm initiatives to be a part of so you do end up working lessIf you want to go into consulting then this could be a good way to build experience and then go somewhere betterbakedpotato244 |2 pointswritten 1 month ago agoWhat is the job title? 40K seems a bit low for EY, I would expect at least 50k-60k for starting salary there.KitKatAttackkkkkk |2 pointswritten 1 month ago agoAgreed. It was $50k starting salary for audit and tax almost 10 years ago. Ice never even heard of OPs position. Is that at the shared services center?[deleted] |1 pointwritten 1 month ago agoFrom some googling \"Service Delivery Center\" sounds like an on-shore shared services center.KitKatAttackkkkkk |1 pointwritten 1 month ago agoI see, well working in the SSC will at least get the foot in the door, but Opie might as well go into internal accounting at any random company at that point. $40k still seems low for a staff analyst...EquivalentSelection |2 pointswritten 1 month ago agoFollow the money.If it's more than what you currently make - go for it.You will also be more marketable with Ernst & Young on your resume vs. \"Luggage Handler at Airport\".Do it.glitterofLydianarmor |2 pointswritten 1 month ago ago$40K is pretty low. EY pays its interns more per hour than you’d be earning.NotVeryGoodAtStuff |2 pointswritten 1 month ago agoSome money is always better than no money.alissa2579 |2 pointswritten 1 month ago agoSeems a bit low to me. Look at salaries in your area to see if it’s in the rangemadpirate-k |1 pointwritten 1 month ago agoWhat does the internet say in regards to the average pay and do you feel it would position you well in your career?revively |1 pointwritten 1 month ago agoTake it because you will get such a resume booster and it sounds like you need one to offset the odd jobs stint. Not to say you are not perfectly qualified without it - otherwise you wouldn't have gotten the offer - but they probably felt like they could squeeze you due to this experience issue. Build up your resume so you have more options. Not uncommon when you are only out a few years.Second - it's Covid and record high unemployment. Take the offer even if it's low. If you get a better one later, jump ship. I can't stress this enough. Much easier to get the pay later.jd_dc |1 pointwritten 1 month ago agoYeah get the big 4 time on your resume. Survive on ramen and rail liquor when you go out for 2 years, then jump to another firm and get some quality of life.But seriously, take the job, make the best of it, and you'll come out ahead. I'm only 6 years out of school but would have jumped at 40k at a big name when I graduated.kingkang80 |1 pointwritten 1 month ago agoI thought you wrote \"earnest and young\"throwaway_eng_fin |1 pointwritten 1 month ago agohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms[deleted] |1 pointwritten 1 month ago agoIt seems from some googling like the \"Service Delivery Center\" is an on-shore version of the more common \"Shared Services Center\" model, the latter of which is basically outsourcing to India. You would probably act as a resource for multiple project teams but not directly interfacing with clients. The preferred route would be to get a non-SDC job (which I'd expect to start at 60k+) but honestly getting EY on your resume instead of baggage handler will be a plus.You will probably have to jump to another job after a couple of years if you want to move to more mainstream consulting roles.dkfnvhr |1 pointwritten 1 month ago agoThey pay does sound a bit low but the company name is very respected. Ask them if they can give you more or at least what are the prospect of promotion after 6 months or a year. Are there other compensating benefits.?"
