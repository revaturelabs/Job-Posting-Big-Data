There are many different reasons why jobs don’t seem to work out for the best or why you feel unhappy with your current employment situation. But how do you know you’ve reached the point where you need a different job rather than simply wishing your job was something more than it is?It’s a tough call that people in all fields and industries must some day make. It’s not easy by any stretch of the imagination. But, it’s a call that will bring a greater sense of peace and serenity into your life than you’ve felt in a long time – at least on a professional level. Here are a few signs that it’s time to start brushing up your resume in order to explore your options elsewhere.1) You can’t seem to forge a connection with any of your coworkers. The bottom line is that for whatever reason (only you can quantify that) you just can’t seem to forget a personal relationship with anyone in your office and that is a sign that you need to get out there and find some people to work with where you feel a connection with your coworkers.2) You don’t want to tell anyone what you do. If you hide every time your kid’s career day comes around or cringe at the thought of meeting new people and answering the inevitable “so what do you do for a living?” question then it’s time to examine why you’re still doing it. Eventually, it’s time to leave the safety net of what you know behind in favor of branching out and doing something you really want to do for a career. At least go for a job you can take pride in doing and know you’re doing it well.3) Your job doesn’t allow you to take care of your skills, talent, or education. These are jobs that are menial and they are costing you the very skills and talents you worked so hard to perfect in college and throughout your career. Now is the time to decide if you really want to continue doing what you’re doing or if it’s time to start getting back to the field or line of work that you’ve always wanted to do and worked hard to be able to do.4) Your job is beginning to impact your health. No job is worth sacrificing your mental and physical well being and ye many people lay those things on the line every day in jobs they’ve grown to despise for fear that there’s nothing else out there for them.It’s not always easy to stick your neck out there and take the risks that go along with finding a new job or switching careers. But making the change can make a world of difference in your life, your health, and your attitude about the future.
