Other companies taking part include Yodel, DHL and UPS who have a further 460 positions to fill.For employers, the National Hiring Days initiative not only helps connect workers with jobs, but can also do so rapidly, reducing the time to hire from an average of six weeks to a matter of days, with the possibility of on-the-spot offers being made to successful interviewees.While this event comes at a time where a further 7,200 jobs are at risk of being cut in shops including Sainsbury’s, John Lewis, Clarks and Lloyds Banking Group; there are also many roles opening up in distribution. XPO Logistics has created 10,775 jobs in the UK to help fulfil heavy demand from consumers across Black Friday and the Christmas peak, increasing the company’s workforce by 14% since 2019. Similarly, Tesco are set to create 16,000 new permanent jobs to cope with the Coronavirus and Christmas peak in demand.John Hardman, chief people officer at Yodel comments: “As we prepare for the run-up to Christmas we have a number of vacancies across the business and we’re excited to be working with Indeed to help those looking for their next role. As part of this, we have introduced our virtual interview process, ensuring convenience and safety for all.”Indeed’s managing director, Bill Richards adds that these are “anxious times” for everyone, but hopes the event will “easily connect jobseekers to employers so that they can quickly find work or make new hires”.With both the newly imposed Covid-19 measures and rising number of cases in the UK, it is likely that other retailers will need to follow suit and hire virtually.Covid-19IndustryResilienceRetailerAdd New CommentYou must be logged in to comment.Newest FirstOldest FirstThe InternetRetailing NewsletterA curated update containing news analysis, reports, podcasts and opinion - completely free and delivered three times weeklyFirst NameLast NameInitials of First NamesEmailSign UpRead MoreEdinburgh Woollen Mill and Bonmarche bought out of administration, some jobs and stores saved as M&S acquires Jaeger’s brand14 Jan 2021Amazon and Asos lead retailer traffic growth as ecommerce dominates 2020 web use13 Jan 2021Asos sees sales rise 23%, but warns of £15m Brexit hit to come13 Jan 2021More than two-thirds of consumers shopping homeware online every month in 2020, MADE.COM poll finds13 Jan 2021Online sales record highest growth for 13 years in 2020: IMRG12 Jan 2021Online sales grew by a third as shoppers shielded from Covid-19 in 2020 – but total sales fell by a record 0.3%: BRC12 Jan 2021You May Also LikeEditorialEDITORIAL How Tesco, Dunelm, Halfords and other Top500 retailers traded in lockdown and over peakRXUKN Brown Group sees sales start to recover after pivot towards homewares and giftsPeakBoohoo reports 40% sales rise and drops 64 suppliers following investigations into standards; Primark counts the cost of lockdownIndustryEdinburgh Woollen Mill and Bonmarche bought out of administration, some jobs and stores saved as M&S acquires Jaeger’s brandBecome a MemberCreate your own public-facing profileGain access to all Top500 researchPersonalise your experience on IR.netRegisterWe are the magazine, portal and research source for European ecommerce and multichannel retail, hosting the board-level conversation for retailers, pureplays and brands across all of our platforms.
