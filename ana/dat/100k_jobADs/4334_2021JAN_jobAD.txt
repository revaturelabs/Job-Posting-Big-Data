I am happy to have laid the foundation for the India chapter of our female employee resource group - Women's Professional Development Network - and serve as its leader for five years. I am also very excited to be involved in the diversity journey of Applied Materials in India and look forward to even greater times ahead.Anshuma SinghGlobal IT Program Manager\"I joined Applied Materials in 2013 as a chemistry manager at our Mumbai Chemistry Center of Excellence.
