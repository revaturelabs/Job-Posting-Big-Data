Graduate school provides the strong technical training and skills needed to excel at a new job, but often students and postdocs aren’t sure how to navigate the job search and application process. This workshop aims to provide advice on key aspects of the job search, such as writing a resume, interviewing, and negotiating for positions.Speakers from diverse employer sectors that have experience with hiring (e.g., academic, industry, non-profit, government) will lead the discussion, representing different career trajectories, as well as diverse viewpoints on the hiring process. The schedule will include time for one or more “hands-on” activities, which may include speed networking with potential employers, mock interviews, or a resume editing workshop.Back to all WorkshopsMember Login	Search	Quick LinksJoin CERF TodaySubscribe to a ListservMy ProfileDonate to CERFJob BoardEstuaries & CoastsCESNCERF 2021CERF 2017 Quick LinksProgram ScheduleSponsors & ExhibitorsUpcoming EventsTue Jan 26, 20212021 CERF Webinar: Preparing for the next 50 years of Coastal and Estuarine ScienceCategory: CERF Events & WebinarsTue Apr 13, 20212021 National Watershed and Stormwater ConferenceCategory: Partner MeetingsWed Apr 14, 20212021 National Watershed and Stormwater ConferenceCategory: Partner MeetingsThu Apr 15, 20212021 National Watershed and Stormwater ConferenceCategory: Partner MeetingsView Full CalendarSupport CERF when you shop on Amazon!Go to smile.amazon.com!Our TweetsTweets by CERFScienceFind Us On FacebookCoastal and Estuarine Research Federation CERF#CERF2017#cerf2017 TweetsThank YouOur Sponsors©2021 Coastal & Estuarine Research Federation2150 N 107th St, #205 | Seattle, WA 98133 | United States(206) 209-5262 | [email protected]Privacy PolicyFacebookTwitterFlickrVimeoLinkedInInstagramBack to toppowered by MemberClicks"
