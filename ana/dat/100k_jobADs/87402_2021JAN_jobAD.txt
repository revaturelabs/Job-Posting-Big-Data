You wrote such an elegant post once where you said that it doesn't matter how autistically someone studies because HR employs trannies, faggots, chads and women, but not ugly men. Unironically have a screenshot of it on my mobile, because it was so perfectly formulated.HR is a bad joke - worthless idiots with no practical value that tell others who has practical values, they only practical thing they really do is raising the next generation of people like them therefore justifying their existence with their existence. Nothing but contempt for HR and the modern job market.Embafalling though the cracks★★★★★JoinedMay 19, 2019Posts23,219Online86d 16h 28mJan 10, 2021#5Thumbs up her va-jjRollD20I don’t belong in this timeline get me out★★★★★JoinedJan 10, 2019Posts11,630Online78d 14h 21mJan 10, 2021#6Emba said:Thumbs up her va-jjClick to expand...Sorry that’s not for youEmbafalling though the cracks★★★★★JoinedMay 19, 2019Posts23,219Online86d 16h 28mJan 10, 2021#7RollD20 said:Sorry that’s not for youClick to expand...REPORTS metomaleRecruit★★★★JoinedJun 12, 2018Posts362Online1d 13h 20mJan 11, 2021#8women always have easy jobs(almost no work)unless they are from the third world.You must log in or register to reply here.Similar threadsTheory It’s honestly over for you if you don’t have girls commenting on your social media posts.StSausageCelJan 19, 2021Inceldom DiscussionReplies9Views255Inceldom Discussion Jan 19, 2021FastBananaCEOBlackpill \"Foids don't even want to be in the same room with ugly incels\" is 100% true statement, here's whyBududubNowJan 9, 2021Inceldom DiscussionReplies1Views369Inceldom Discussion Jan 9, 2021DisgustingSlobLifeFuel Unpopular opinion: I think some foids can be basedyikerinosJan 9, 2021Inceldom Discussion2Replies66Views2KInceldom Discussion Thursday at 10:25 AMyikerinosDiscussion Would foids participate in state funded courses to improve their personalities?GermaniaInceliaJan 17, 2021Inceldom DiscussionReplies2Views130Inceldom Discussion Jan 17, 2021GermaniaInceliaToxic Femininity Feminism is not compatible with foids' natureUglymeJan 3, 2021Inceldom DiscussionReplies6Views320Inceldom Discussion Jan 3, 2021LiteralGoblinShare:ShareLight (2021)Contact usTerms and rulesPrivacy policyHelpHomeRSS| Style and add-ons by ThemeHouseTop BottomThis site uses cookies to help personalise content, tailor your experience and to keep you logged in if you register.By continuing to use this site, you are consenting to our use of cookies.Accept Learn more…"
