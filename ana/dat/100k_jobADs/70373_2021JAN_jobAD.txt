Our team of experts is driving the maturation of machine learning and other core technologies for autonomous flight; we are creating a reference architecture that includes hardware, software, and a data-driven development process to allow aircraft to perceive and react to their environment. Autonomous flight is transforming the transportation industry - our team is at the heart of this revolutionThe OpportunityThis is your chance to build autonomous airplane systems! During this internship you will join our perception team, developing data acquisition and processing pipelines that will be deployed on our aircraft. The internship will be hands-on, allowing you to test the code you will write on a real system.Intern ResponsibilitiesSupport the development, integration, and testing of sensing software and hardware, including visible spectrum cameras, infrared cameras, INS/GNSS and radarsCreate software and algorithms to manage sensor data acquisition and processingSupport field testing of our systems, some of which fly on real manned aircraftRequirementsSignificant academic background in computer science, electrical engineering, or a related fieldWorking proficiency in C/C++ or Python on a Linux-based OSCommand of software fundamentals (iteration, data structures, object oriented programming, bits and bytes) and best practicesKnowledge of computer vision algorithms (e.g. OpenCV)Real-world experience with autonomous systems (e.g. mobile robots, cars, aircraft) and related sensors (e.g. lidar, radar, cameras, inertial measurement units)Intellectual curiosity to do what hasn’t been done before, coupled with a drive to overcome challengesNice-to-have experience you might bring:Hands on experience working with camera systemsFamiliarity with robotics algorithms, such as localization, sensor fusion, image/signal processing, guidance, navigation, and controlA passion for making things flyAbout A³ by Airbus GroupMission Imagine a world without boundaries, free of constraints.
