The Technical University of Munich is one of the top research universities in Europe fostering a strong entrepreneurial spirit and international culture.Project and Job DescriptionThe focus of this position is on developing new methods for the grand challenge of guaranteeing safe maneuvers of automated vehicles. A special focus will be on considering uncertainties in the future behavior of other traffic participants as well as uncertainties originating from the object retrieval of environment sensors (e.g. video cameras, LIDAR, RADAR, etc.). Using methods from optimization in conjunction with formal verification methods should provide a prediction of surrounding traffic participants ensuring the enclosure of the true behavior. These prediction methods are also referred to as set-based prediction. Our latest paper regarding this topic can be found at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9170860. Results should be demonstrated using Common Road, our driving simulator, as well as our autonomous vehicle.EligibilityTo be eligible for PhD Position for Set-Based Prediction in Autonomous Driving, applicants must have:Excellent Master’s degree (or equivalent) in computer science, engineering, or related disciplines (typically mathematics, physics).Fluency in spoken and written English is required.Good programming skills in at least one programming language, e.g. MATLAB, C/C++, Python.Highly motivated and keen on working in an international and interdisciplinary teamApplicants with strong background in the following fields are preferred:Signals and systemsRobotics and autonomous drivingFormal verificationLogicsSoftware engineeringBenefitsThe applicant will be directly advised by Prof. Matthias Althoff. Besides excellent skills for conducting innovative science, the candidate should also be talented in implementing research results on a real vehicle and lead teams of students. Our Offer PhD remuneration will be in line with the current German collective pay agreement TV-L E13 (around 4300 Euros/month). Technical University of Munich is an equal opportunity employer committed to excellence through diversity. We explicitly encourage women to apply and preference will be given to disabled applicants with equivalent qualifications.ApplicationInternational candidates are highly encouraged to apply. Please send a complete application (in English or German) including a CV, the Master thesis (highly recommended), your full transcript of records and contact details to Moritz Klischat. Please do not include a cover letter. We kindly ask you to use the subject line “Application to Set-Based Prediction in Autonomous Driving” in your application email.APPLYRelated JobsShowing 1 - 4 of 5 jobs10 Doctoral Research Positions in Chemistry – GermanyGermanyGermanyPart Time1 month agoPhD Position for Set-Based Prediction in Autonomous Driving – GermanyGermanyGermanyFull Time2 months agoPhD Positions in Neuroscience – GermanyRuhr-Universität BochumGermanyGermanyFull Time2 months agoPhD Position Muslim Interreligious Encounters in the Pre-Modern Mediterranean – NetherlandsNetherlandsNetherlandsFull Time2 months agoJob OverviewQualificationMaster DegreeJob Location1023 Dawnview Ct, Pittsburg CA, 94565WhatsApp : +92 333 899 899 7info@scholarshipnjob.comFacebookTwitterInstagramPinterestDribbbleGoogleImportant LinksAbout UsTerms & PoliciesHow It WorksOur BlogFAQ’sSupportPost a JobContact UsFind JobsPhD PositionsResearch AssistantsLecturerAssistant ProfessorAssociate ProfessorProfessors© 2020 Scholarshipnjob.
