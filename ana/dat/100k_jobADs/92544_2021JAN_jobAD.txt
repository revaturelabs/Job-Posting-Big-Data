Having achieved promotion to the top flight last May through the play-offs they spent over £100 million on new players in the summer. However, their side has looked desperately unbalanced this season, and many of the new players have failed to gel. The club’s supporters will be hoping that Ranieri’s experience and eye for a player can help steer them up the table.Andy DalzielAndy is an exiled English football fan living in Cyprus.
