Before you go, take a few moments to prepare by compiling a list of questions you want to ask during the meeting. Asking questions will help you learn more about the job and whether it's right for you. Writing down your questions and bringing them with you will ensure you get the answers you seek and that you don't forget to address any important points.Selecting Your QuestionsYour questions should not be anything that could easily be answered with a quick Internet search of the company’s name. For example, don't ask how long the company has been in business or who the founder or president is. Instead, choose specific questions that only the interviewer will be able to answer. For example, ask about the work environment or long- and short-term goals of the department you'll be working in. Try to ask at least five questions during the interview. Type or write them, and be sure to leave plenty of space after each question to jot down notes about the answers you're given during the interview.Questions to AskWhile you can ask almost anything you desire during the interview, some questions will reveal more about the position and company than others. Ask why the position is open and what problems need to be addressed by the person taking the job. This will show that you are interested in helping the company grow and that you're willing to tackle and fix issues. Ask for more information about the position itself, especially if the job description or posting was vague about the duties or scheduling for the position. You may also ask what a typical work day is like for employees, what makes top-notch employees stand out within the company or how the interviewer would describe the corporate culture around the office. You can take your questions a step further and ask specific questions about the interviewer herself. For example, ask her to describe her personal vision for the company or her management style. These types of questions will show you are genuinely interested in the job and will give you more information about how well you'd fit in with your potential colleagues.Questions to AvoidWhile you probably want to ask about the salary and any potential benefits, avoid only asking questions that pertain to pay, time off or perks. According to US News, doing so could make it look like you aren't genuinely interested in the job and only care about the compensation, which is a major red flag to many employers. While it's acceptable to ask the interviewer pointed questions, keep it professional and refrain from asking anything personal. For example, how many children he has or whether he's married are not appropriate interview questions as they have nothing to do with the job at hand.Displaying Your QuestionsIf you wish to hand write your questions, do so in a professional-looking notebook and try to write as nicely as possible. While you certainly won't hand the list over to the interviewer and it is simply for your reference, the interviewer will probably see it. Bringing a wrinkled, dirty sheet of paper with questions haphazardly scrawled across it probably won't make a very good impression. An easier way to throw together a professional-looking list of questions is to simply type and print them. Regardless of how you present your questions, bring your own pen to jot down notes during the interview.Related ArticlesThe Five Things to Prepare for a Job Interview→How to Make Money Writing Trivia Questions→How To Interview For A Job: Interview Tips and Prep Questions→How to Write a Job Reference for a Friend→Hilarious Job Interview Questions→The Best Answers in an Interview→ReferencesUS News Money: The Right Questions to Ask at Your Next InterviewWashington Work Source: Interview PreparationResourcesForbes: 30 Questions You Should and Shouldn't Ask in an InterviewPhoto CreditsPattanaphong Khuankaew/iStock/GettyImagesShare ItShareTweetPostEmailPrintGet the JobResumes and CVsApplicationsCover LettersProfessional ReferencesInterviewsNetworkingGet AheadGet a PromotionNegotiationProfessional EthicsProfessionalismDealing with CoworkersDealing with BossesCareer PathsCompare CareersSwitching CareersTraining and CertificationsStart a CompanyStudentsInternships and ApprenticeshipsEntry Level JobsCollege DegreesJob DescriptionsLaw Enforcement Job DescriptionsAdministrative Job DescriptionsHealthcare Job DescriptionsSales Job DescriptionsFashion Job DescriptionsEducation Job DescriptionsSalary InsightsJournalism SalariesHealthcare SalariesMilitary SalariesEngineering SalariesTeaching SalariesAbout UsAccessibilityTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCopyright PolicyContact UsFind a JobManage PreferencesCopyright 2021 Leaf Group Ltd. / Leaf Group Media, All Rights Reserved."
