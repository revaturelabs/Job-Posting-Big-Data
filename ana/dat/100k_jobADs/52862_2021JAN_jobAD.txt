"Celebrating My 1 Year Career Break AnniversaryBlogAboutThe Jet SistersTravelLifestyleMedia SavvyPressSearch for:BlogAboutThe Jet SistersTravelLifestyleMedia SavvyPressDecember 2, 2011Celebrating One Year Without a *Real* JobWritten by AngieMy last day as a travel publicist in NYC was exactly one year ago today. A YEAR! Already! (I‚Äôm toasting the milestone in London with my brother and a horde of friends I‚Äôve met around the world while traveling this year. So much better than a board meeting and entering my billable hours into SAP!)When I was home in September watching TV with my little sister, I suddenly had a moment where I earnestly exclaimed, ‚ÄúI am almost 30 and I don‚Äôt even have a job! I quit my job! Holy crap. Who does that?!‚Äù My sister just looked at me incredulously‚Ä¶ after all, I‚Äôd been unemployed by my own design for nearly 10 months at that point. I suppose as I began to near the end of my originally forecast journey, the idea that I‚Äôd given up a great job in search of adventures finally dawned on me as something a little out of the ordinary. But was it worth it?It‚Äôs no secret ‚Äî I loved my job. Loved my agency. My colleagues. My clients. I had very few complaints about my work life, so I wasn‚Äôt one of those people who was excited to tell the boss I was leaving and storm out in a defiant huff. It was brutal. Packing up my 17 pairs of under-the-desk shoes and walking out of my office on Dec. 2, 2010, was more sad than triumphant.But ultimately I wanted more and I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be satisfied until I took on the world by myself.So‚Ä¶ was it worth it?A thousand times yes! I‚Äôve visited 13 countries and made unforgettable memories and precious friends. Adventures found me. Opportunities popped up. Sharks tried to eat my face. I‚Äôve watched my blog traffic grow bigger and bigger (thanks, y‚Äôall!) and gotten a better tan than I ever thought possible.When I stop to take a breath and flip through the photos, I‚Äôm just overwhelmed with gratitude. I can‚Äôt believe I did it! I can‚Äôt believe it all happened ‚Äì a lifetime worth of experience crammed into one year. Even with the unavoidable downsides of long term travel, I have to say quitting my *real* job to travel was the best idea I ever had.After a year of funemployment and a big birthday under my belt, I confess don‚Äôt really feel much different. I‚Äôm still a bit of a perfectionist about some things, but I‚Äôve really loosened the reins on my planning OCD. Quite often, I have no idea where I‚Äôm going next, or when, or even where I‚Äôm sleeping that night. I don‚Äôt even print out itineraries or flight confirmations anymore. Pre-RTW Angie would‚Äôve required hospitalization without a packet‚Ä¶ post-RTW Angie takes it in stride.I like that I don‚Äôt have to wake up at any certain time anymore. I don‚Äôt have to commute to the office. Now, when I do work on freelance projects and Angie Away, it‚Äôs at cafes, hotel rooms and the occasional balcony overlooking the Aegean Sea. The only person my hourly rate goes to is me (well, and 10% to God) ‚Äì not 75% to corporate overhead. (There are a few things I miss about office life. I‚Äôll get to those later!)One thing I‚Äôve learned this year is that it‚Äôs not the work part of working that doesn‚Äôt work for me. I still put in 30-40 hours a week if not more, and for far less money. But now I work for me, on my terms, on my schedule and nowhere near a cubicle. My money goes in my pocket. And even though it‚Äôs not nearly on par with my old paycheck, now I know how little it takes to live this nomadic life, so it doesn‚Äôt even matter.I‚Äôve also learned, after some trial and error, that everything will work itself out. There‚Äôs no need to get anxious about finding a place to stay or coordinating a tour or making friends or making money. If I need something, I usually just pray about it and boom! An answer or solution presents itself. Every time. I just have to be willing to wait for the right answer.So what‚Äôs next?Initially I planned to have a proper career break ‚Äì travel for a year and then pick a city, find another PR agency job and get back to business. But even with the downsides of a nomadic lifestyle, it still beats living in a cubicle, eating lunch at my desk, fluorescent lighting and making heaps of money for other people.Turns out, my career break wasn‚Äôt a break at all. My progress in the travel industry has continued despite not having a *real* job, and now, instead of going back to the same old, same old, I‚Äôll be calling the shots and working on my own public relations, social media and writing projects. At least for the foreseeable future.If you‚Äôre thinking about taking some time off work to travel, all I can say is WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Save the money and just go!Have you ever thought about quitting your job and traveling?

I quit my job 4 months ago ‚Äì not quite to do the RTW trip yet, but to spend time on my desire to explore my home country Indonesia, writing, and photography. I just came back from one month in Bali solo-backpacking, road-tripping all the way up to the east and north Bali in a car, and I loved it.I do aspire for RTW trip, but taking it on baby steps with local travels, just because I think Indonesia has so many places I would love to see.In any case, kudos to you ‚Äì you are a great inspiration üôÇThis post came through as I landed in Jakarta, and I can resonate with so many points you raised in this post.ReplyDecember 05, 2011Angie AwayIndonesia is an awesome place to start! Good luck with those baby steps and bon voyage!ReplyDecember 03, 2011SarahCongratulations on your year of funemployment!Yes, few people are lucky enough to find jobs they enjoy like you did.

I‚Äôm currently on a road trip in the US.I‚Äôm finding that the longer I‚Äôm away from home the more I realize that I don‚Äôt really need much to live happily as well. It‚Äôs definitely nice not having to wake up to an alarm clock and not be on someone else‚Äôs schedule, work on my own projects anytime and anywhere I want.I planned for a 1 to 1.5 year break but if I end up really liking this lifestyle hopefully I can find a way to keep doing it :).Thanks for posting this, it makes me feel better about my decision! üôÇGood luck on your projects!ReplyDecember 05, 2011Angie AwayIt sure is fun being a nomad, isn‚Äôt it?

I‚Äôm up to being able to leave for 4 days in a row & feel somehwat comfortable. Whoo Hoo!RTW here I come üòâReplyDecember 05, 2011Angie AwayI think ultimately I‚Äôll get to the point where I can travel a bit less but set things up where I can leave a few days like you said without worrying. Good luck making that happen for you!ReplyDecember 06, 2011Alex at Alex in WanderlandWhat an inspiring post! I‚Äôm learning the joys and struggles of working for myself as well.

Cheers!ReplyDecember 11, 2011Angie AwayIt HAS been quite a journey, but an awfully good one! Great to hear from you!ReplyDecember 13, 2011Camels & ChocolateOooh I hope your new PR endeavors mean we get to work together again! I mean, being friends is good enough for me (obviously), but as you know, you were always the BEST PR GIRL EVER and so awesome to travel/work with!ReplyDecember 14, 2011Angie AwayYou just never know! And thanks for the props‚Ä¶ sometimes I do miss my PR days, especially now when I work with PR people who just can‚Äôt seem to respond to emails in a timely manner or who offer trips and then never follow up. Crossing fingers that I‚Äôll see you soon‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs bound to happen!ReplyDecember 27, 2011MarissaGreat blog, Angie! So inspiring! How did you financially support yourself throughout your trip if you weren‚Äôt employed? Would love some advice as I plan to take a RTW trip as well from a PR background. P.S. Go Gators!ReplyDecember 27, 2011Angie AwayHi Marissa ‚Äì thanks for reading! During the first year, I spent what I‚Äôd saved during my entire 7 year PR career‚Ä¶ which was somewhere around 20k. Now that I‚Äôm moving into my second year of travel, I‚Äôm working on a variety of projects to keep the party going ‚Äì I‚Äôm consulting, selling ads on my site and continuing to freelance travel write when I find the time. If you have other questions I‚Äôm happy to help! Go Gators!ReplyJune 25, 2012LanaLOVE this post! When my hubby and I decided to take an expat opportunity for three years, I had to quit a job that I absolutely loved. It has been about 11 months since I told my boss, and while I was so scared of being ‚Äújobless‚Äù I discovered so much about myself, what I love and the world outside of my cubical since we have been on this adventure.ReplyJune 25, 2012Angie AwayThank you for sharing!ReplyJuly 30, 2012AnnaHi Angie! I just came across your blog while reading your article about how you‚Äôd do things differently if you were to study abroad again. I‚Äôll also be heading to Paris this fall, but for a full academic year, and am so excited to start traveling, as I dream of the kind of life you‚Äôre currently leading! I noticed you said that freelance work contributes to your income, which is something I‚Äôve been researching lately. How did you score your first freelance jobs? I‚Äôve worked for my college‚Äôs newspaper and plan to start a blog when I‚Äôm abroad, but I have no idea how to freelance so any tips would be great! I love to write and hope to pursue it as a career one day.ReplyAugust 07, 2012Angie AwayFreelancing isn‚Äôt the easy road, and it barely pays the bills ‚Äì BUT if you can stomach that, it can be fun. I basically networked my way into early assignments, and then it was easier to pitch magazines & newspapers once I had a bit of a portfolio built up. Definitely blog while you‚Äôre abroad ‚Äì it‚Äôs a great way to document your trip, keep up-to-date on your writing skills and let everyone at home know how you‚Äôre doing. Just make it a priority to post often!You‚Äôll have so much fun in Paris ‚Äì eat a nutella crepe for me!ReplyLeave a CommentCancel replyName *Email *WebsiteCommentSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.CONTACTWORK WITH MERESOURCESANGIE LIVEFAQSEARCHLATEST PINCONNECTFEATURED BYDISCLAIMER | PRIVACY POLICY | WEBSITE BY FURTHER BOUND | COPYRIGHT ¬© ANGIE AWAY 2000-2021"
