Picture: NCA NewsWire / Dan PeledSource:News Corp AustraliaAs young Queenslanders struggle with unemployment in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, a new report from a leading independent body reveals the state could be sitting on a bonanza with the potential to create tens of thousands of new jobs.The Sunshine State has a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity to become a world leader in renewable energy industries, create about 25,000 new roles and contribute $500 billion to the national economy, according to a new study from the Climate Council.The report, Leaders and Legends: Thousands of Clean Jobs for Queenslanders, has outlined how the state has a unique advantage to capitalise on the energy industry and export opportunities.The council proposes the investment to come from both the public and private sector to unlock the benefits for the economy.“There are so many reasons to be optimistic about Queensland’s economic future as it rebuilds from COVID-19,” Climate Council chief executive Amanda McKenzie said.RELATED: Palaszczuk heads into her toughest seatRenewable energy could create tens of thousands of jobs.

We want a competitive price for industries to come here, to set-up, and to manufacture here.“That will eventually drive down power prices when you have it connected to the national electricity market.”trending in technology124Chester Hill: Driver charged after alleged failed burnouts, ...65Macquare University Photonics study shoots lasers through di...46Why Toyota believes a self-drifting car project could save l...50‘Burn the house down’: ’Monster’ brown snake guards family’s...35Coronavirus Sydney: Blacktown Council introduces $450 fine f...Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailBack to TopMORE IN environmentBring on La Nina, say bush firefightersVirgin boss’ ‘burger shame’ outburstDozens of uni students strip off’Scandalous’ project Budget is fundingFind usAdvertiseAbout UsNewslettersConnectBe rewarded for your opinionsDownload the AppPrivacy PolicyRelevant Ad Opt-OutCookie PolicyTerms & ConditionsOur TeamCouponsA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.
