"The Day Job – CRISPLY SPOKENSkip to contentCRISPLY SPOKENMenu	Joined at the Heart · Writers WriteThe Day JobMay 24, 2013 Elisabeth Crisp / @crisplyspoken	Last week, I answered a questionnaire for a national polling company. The form asked, “Do you work?” They meant. Are you employed? I paused, pen suspended over dual boxes. Yes or no? I scribbled in the margin.Yes, I work. Everyday. I take care of my family. Full time. By choice. It’s 2013 not 1957. This is a sexist question.Fourteen years ago this month I changed day jobs. The current one doesn’t garner a paycheck. I’m on call 24/7 to complete tasks that may require a philosopher, an engineer, a maid, a chauffeur, and a chef. All at once. The position demands stamina, focus, and a generous portion of pixie dust.Here’s last month’s portfolio.Cherry sang a solo in the school musical. Costume design by mom.Coco hung out with her Youth Orchestra San Antonio Conductor. Concert photography by mom.Coco and Cherry stood too close to waves crashing on the jetty at Mustang Island State Park. Travel coordinated by mom.Cherry received state recognition in the Duke University Talent Inventory Program. Chauffeured and valeted by mom.The girls wore high heels. Coco’s courtesy of mom.Cherry raced. That’s her in the far right lane. Sports photography by mom.Share this:TwitterFacebookTumblrRedditPinterestLinkedInPocketPrintEmailLike this:Like Loading...Published by Elisabeth Crisp / @crisplyspokenI write funny stories about serious subjects.
