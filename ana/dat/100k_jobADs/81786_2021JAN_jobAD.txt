Some job seekers make the mistake of putting everything that they have ever done on their resume.Talk about too much information!Keep your resume short and to the point, and be sure to:Look at the job ad and use the words that they use to highlight your skillsOutline your training, apprenticeships, qualifications, licensesMention soft skills and things you did on previous jobs to keep things running smoothly, like customer service that went above and beyond.Update your LinkedIn profileThe use of LinkedIn is picking up in blue-collar industries, both on the candidate and client-side. But it is still predominantly used by people in white-collar professions.If you’re familiar with computers and social media, learn how to improve your LinkedIn profile to stay ahead. But otherwise, it’s safe to stick with job boards.Check yourselfStop randomly applying for every job that’s remotely related to what you do. You won’t stand a chance against an applicant tracking system or a recruiter.To improve your odds of bagging an interview, have a good think about the type of job you’re qualified for and narrow your search. If there is a job you really want that you’re not a match for, think about how to make yourself one - learn a new skill or get in front of the hiring manager to explain why you’ve applied and why you should be considered for the role.Dress appropriatelyFirst impressions do count. And your appearance on the day of the interview can certainly shape how the hiring manager perceives you.However, when it comes to blue-collar roles, the way you should dress really depends on the type of job you’re applying for. Some instances may call for casual, some may call for a suit and others may call for personal protective clothing.If you’re unsure, contact the hiring manager or human resources department to ask for guidance. If you don’t feel comfortable doing that, it’s always better to come overdressed than under dressed - clean shoes, a collared shirt and trousers should be a safe bet.Show up on timeWe cannot stress this enough.Being late can be regarded as disrespectful or inconsiderate while turning up on time can illustrate your commitment to the position from the get-go.What’s more, your employer will be looking for someone who is reliable and will show up for jobs on time. So make a good first impression by turning up to your interview on time.(Bonus points if you’re early.)Come preparedBe sure to read the job description. This will give you an idea of the questions that the interviewer is likely to ask and the qualifications and experience you need to mention. It will also help to do a bit of background research on the company - jump on their website and peruse their social media pages to get a feel for what they do and how they do it. It might also be a good idea to brush up on how to answer some common interview questions.If in doubt, bring a list of points to cover. The hiring manager will want to know all about your training, capabilities and experience. And a bulleted list will ensure that you remember to mention everything.Be yourselfCompletely rehearsed answers won’t get you far and can even mislead potential employers. So, be genuine - give honest answers and build rapport with your interviewers. This way they can be confident that the person they’re hiring is the same person who will show up to work on Monday morning.After the interviewAt the end of your interview, thank the interviewer for their time, shake their hand confidently and ask when you’re likely to hear back about the role.Be prepared to provide at least two referees.Keep on truckingResearch shows that the average job-seeker is rejected 24 times before landing a job. So, don’t let a job rejection dampen your spirits. Keep asking for feedback and fine-tuning your resume until you land a great offer.Let Trojan Recruitment Group help you with your blue collar job searchTrojan is an Australian recruitment company that helps individuals find permanent, temporary and contract jobs in Building and Construction, Defence, Engineering, Rail, Manufacturing & Industrial, Mining Resources & Energy, Trades & Labour, Transport, Warehousing & Logistics.More job seeker resources:Tips to improve your LinkedIn profileThe ultimate guide to common interview questions and how to answer them5 huge mistakes you could be making on your job application11 tips to stay mentally fit while job huntingTags in articleCareersShare this blogLatest blogsWhy Your Work Attitude Needs to Change in 20219 days agoThe 6 Short Courses Everyone’s Doing!9 days agoSnooze and You Lose – How a Lack of Sleep Can Cost Your Job9 days agoThe Top 6 Most In-Demand Roles in 20219 days agoView allJob SeekersSearch jobsJob seeker informationSign up for job alertsTimesheetsReport itFeedback formEmployer ServicesLabour hirePermanent recruitmentContract recruitmentConsulting servicesManaged servicesSubmit an enquiryFeedback formAbout TrojanOur companyOur peopleOur locationsSafety at TrojanCorporate social responsibilityCertifications & recognitionOur enterprise agreementsCareers at TrojanNews and insightsDownload RecruitNewsTrojan IndustriesBuilding & ConstructionDefenceEngineeringRailTrades and LabourManufacturing & IndustrialMining, Resources & EnergyTransport, Warehousing & LogisticsGet in touchWe would love to hear from you​Contact usCopyright © - All Rights Reserved Trojan Recruitment GroupPrivacy PolicyTerms and Conditions"
