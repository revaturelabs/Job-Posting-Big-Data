I have some time to spare this week and I’m using it to get ahead. To me, there’s no better feeling than knowing I had a productive day. Actually…there is something better – knowing that I’m ahead for the week and I can take it a bit easier and put in extra time on a few projects. To be honest, finding leads is the most tedious part of the day. It takes two to three hours to get it done every morning. That’s why I try and get as much done the night before, so my whole morning isn’t spend doing the job search. It’s not that I don’t enjoy it, but I do like to get it out of the way so I can work on other fun stuff.Premium Job:Dear FWG readers,I need talented writers for putting together entertaining informational articles across a wide variety of subjects – from portable air conditioners to swimming pools, and everything in between. The ideal applicants will be able to conduct research and write about often potentially bland subjects in and interesting, engaging manner.Please also do not apply for this position unless you are able to produce at least five to ten quality articles per week (with a minimum of 500 words each).If you think this sounds like you, please send me an email at [email protected] with a short paragraph about yourself and your background, as well as any experience you have in the freelance writing field (if applicable).Thanks,JonathanI hope you enjoy today’s lists.Your daily listsThere’s lots of good stuff here today.

I feel this is important to explore. The first step in beginning a freelance writing career is to research and if brand new writers are finding conflicting information, that means I’m part of the problem. My method of sharing information is to present the various opportunities, tell you what worked for me, and let you make the choices you’re comfortable. Other bloggers have their own line of thinking and they’re not wrong. I can understand the confusion. Let’s have a little town hall. Tell us what frustrates you – what mixed messages you’re receiving and I’ll do my best to address them all. I’m not going to promise to have all the answers, but I can at least try to help clear up the confusion.Your Daily ListsNew around the Freelance Writing Jobs networkThe Rates are Going Up and Other Freelance Writing Job TrendsUnderstanding Freelance Rights and UsageShowing and Telling for Article WritersYour Turn: What is Your Dream Writing Job?Recommended reading from around the blogosphereOpen Thread: How Free are Freelancers?
