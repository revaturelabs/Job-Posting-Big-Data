The Asians/Chinese must be inferior in some way, right? LOL8 months ago # QUOTE 2 Jab 1 No Jab !Economist1a3bIn some cultures people spit indoors. In others people do not. That is why it is important to preserve institutional identity.8 months ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 1 No Jab !Economist4671It’s really funny seeing all these posts trying to justify discrimination by using stereotypes and more discrimination. The Asians/Chinese must be inferior in some way, right? LOLAsian Americans may be inferior in some way. But the Eurobro and the industry bro haven't been able to convincingly explain what that way is. They seem unable to accept that Asian Americans are actually rated quite strongly on \"soft skills.\"As I've said before, there's only two possible stories here:(1) The Harvard admissions committee are capable of deeper insights into the applicants' \"soft skills\" than 3 letter writers and alumni interviews, all without ever meeting the applicants in person.(2) Harvard uses the \"personal\" rating to ensure a desired racial balance. Without this \"personal\" rating, evaluating Asian Americans on \"soft skills\" still results in a non-desired racial balance.Eurobro is okay with the first half of (2) but not the second half.8 months ago # QUOTE 3 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist92a3David cars is a r@ci$t8 months ago # QUOTE 2 Jab 0 No Jab !Economistaa51One could compare the average GPA of Asian Americans vs. Whites vs. African Americans\\Latinos, but I doubt Harvard will like the outcomes..If AsAmericans are admitted at lower than reasonable numbers, we should expect that the admitees had much higher average ability than other ethnic groups and would therefore outperform them in terms of output quality. Do we?GPA scores are predictors of what we care about, but they are not output per se. Why not look at income ten years out?8 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economist0c91Does your anecdote refer to American students, which is the subject of this paper?Could this have to do with lack of empathy?I have a medical condition that sometimes sends me to emergency room. Over the years and across different jobs, i always Have been surprised how Chinese students/coleagues have difficulty showing empathy and they cannot help to not ask:So when do you we think we can finish project/paper?And this is given that i always deliver and my track record is perfect, so no worries on longterm prospects.They just seem to fail to understand I work to live and not live to work. Or it could be the 9/9/6 culture clouding their judgement rather than lack of empathy.As an interviewer, that is a red flag in terms of fit and my feedbacks always include one part about fit. Maybe same applies to the Harvard applications and you will never see those notes because their are confidential.8 months ago # QUOTE 1 Jab 0 No Jab !Economistc3f7Anyone who thinks that Harvard is not playing around with the personality scores to get desired r_acial quotas is either helplessly naive, passionately anti Asian-American or a Harvard alumni. I mean, what is the probability of the event that the following six things happen simultaneously: (1) Asian-Americans have excellent academic credentials; (2) Asian-Americans are scored highly on personality scores by Harvard Alumni; (3) African-Americans have relatively lower academic credentials; (4) African-Americans are scored relatively lower on personality scores by Harvard Alumni; (5) Asian-Americans are scored lowly on personality scores by Harvard Admissions; (6) African-Americans are scored highly on personality scores by Harvard Admissions.Much more likely is that Harvard wants African-Americans to be severely over-represented relative to any of their objective scores, and the only way of doing it is playing around with the only part of the admissions process that is purely subjective.And yes, what this shows is that (a) the academic left has a bias against Asian-Americans (they actually have a word for this - \"acting white\"); (b) the Republicans need to focus on getting votes from Asian-Americans.8 months ago # QUOTE 8 Jab 0 No Jab !Economistdc85Harvard sells elite network, not education. Xi’s daughter studies there. So did R Gandhi. Educational qualifications are not sufficient for Harvard. Education is just a cover page story for Harvard. It is your responsibility to get real.See, the trick that they (and a few other elite colleges) perfected is that they truly sell both. If you are a math genius, you will find plenty of others like yourself at Harvard, from students to senior faculty. If you are dumb but come from an important rich or political family, you too will find plenty of others like yourself, too. And sometimes these two happen to be complementary, like when a smart kid sets up a hedge fund or a startup, and benefits from having rich friends. It is this complementarity that makes places like Harvard so hard to unseat, and they know it and maintain the balance very carefully.8 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !Economistc2efBump7 months ago # QUOTE 0 Jab 0 No Jab !« Previous1…89ReplyPost	Nobody cares.
