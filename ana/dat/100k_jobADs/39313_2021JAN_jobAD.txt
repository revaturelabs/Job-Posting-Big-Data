"Cob Jockey: Job Interview and St. Louis Eventing Sceneskip to main | skip to sidebarCob JockeyDressage with a Welsh CobPagesAbout ConnorAbout MeAbout Welsh CobsShow ResultsProduct ReviewsJanuary 24, 2014Job Interview and St. Louis Eventing SceneI have a confession to make: on Monday I interviewed for an engineering job in St. Louis. I ended up being a very narrow second choice based on the fact that the other candidate had more years of experience than I do. They were very honest with me, liked me and are considering me for a future position once their environment is more established. It's the curse of being 26 in enterprise IT. I'll get there.While it would have been a great career move and a huge pay bump, I was relieved not to have gotten it from a horse point of view. Central Indiana is a really great place to live as an eventer, and I didn't realize that until I started looking into the Missouri eventing scene.Noooooooooooooooope.Boarding barns fell into three categories: 1: barbed wire fences, 2: \"We accept all equestrians but if you're not riding in a treeless saddle you're a terrible person (aka \"My way or the highway\" BM's) and 3: Turnout is an optional extra for a fee. For events, you're traveling to Chicago if you're anywhere in Area VI, which includes like North Dakota. Really.We're lucky here to have the Hoosier Horse Park, Kentucky Horse Park, Twin Towers and others so close to us. And I really think those facilities are the reason that we have so many eventing barns with good care and great instruction around the city of Indianapolis (broadly and relatively speaking).FF Eventing Team XC schooling at the Hoosier Horse Park, June 2013Not that I take my current facility for granted, but the whole thing made me realize that with my husband still trying to find full time employment (but with a great part time job), we could have to move at any moment. I'm likely never going to have this horse situation again and that I need to take advantage of it as long as I have it. I was struggling to find a barn with just passable care in St. Louis let alone good instruction and with eventing friends, and I'm currently (working my butt off to stay) at an awesome facility with a great trainer and an eventing team. Time to really take advantage of that.On that note, I got a GCal invite from my trainer for an hour and a half \"Mounted Team Practice: Group 1\" on Sunday at noon, along with a few other teammates. I have no idea what that's about, or what we'll do, or why we're doing it, or whether it costs anything extra, but I'm excited to find out!Labels: eventing19 comments:Karley January 24, 2014 at 12:15 PMBummer about the job but awesome that they were honest with you!We are in MO this weekend visiting fam :) yes the barn scene around here is very different!!ReplyDeleteRepliesJen January 24, 2014 at 6:46 PMThat's awesome, you're so close to me! Yes, it was good, honestly.DeleteRepliesReplyReplySheMovedtoTexas January 24, 2014 at 1:00 PMSorry about the job, but sounds like it was one of those 'works out fort he best' kind of things.ReplyDeleteRepliesJen January 24, 2014 at 6:46 PMI definitely agree.DeleteRepliesReplyReplyPaola January 24, 2014 at 1:45 PMMy dad is an engineer in the areospace industry. Sorry you didn't get the job, but it is good you took everything into consideration first.ReplyDeleteRepliesJen January 24, 2014 at 6:47 PMVery cool! That sounds like a fun job. It's tough to make a decision like that.DeleteRepliesReplyReplyHawk January 24, 2014 at 1:47 PMBeing young really can work against you :(. Also, being young combined with looking even younger than your young age = the pits. I'm discovering that more and more as time goes by ><; Don't worry - this was probably for the best!ReplyDeleteRepliesJen January 24, 2014 at 6:48 PMYes! I'm sure you know what I mean. And being a young woman that is really short and in a men's field. I think so too!DeleteRepliesReplyReplyeventer79 January 24, 2014 at 2:31 PMBummer about the job, but as someone who hires, being a close second is REALLY good and I always recommend my second choices on and they usually get hired in short order!There is a community of eventers that is suprisingly larger than you'd think around St Louis. I had an \"almost move\" to Kansas City a couple years ago. They have a beautiful horse park there called Heritage Park that hosts horse trials in Overland Park (suburb), but I found a lot more stuff up in the St Louis area.http://macta.info/Look up ksbadger on COTH, SUPER helpful and lives out there, I can't remember which of those two cities but is very involved with their Adult Riders and CTA. Adult Riders program is DE BOMB and they will hook you up. If you seriously think you are going to move there, I'd go ahead and join now, it's not expensive and you have instant network.I know when I thought I was moving, ksbadger was awesome and super helpful. I was HEARTBROKEN to be leaving Area II and NC and my Carolina Horse Park, but I discovered there are actually a fair number of opportunities out there!ReplyDeleteRepliesJen January 24, 2014 at 6:50 PMThank you, thank you, thank you for this! Since there's still a chance my husband will get a job there, I am so glad you replied with this! In the event that we do end up over there, I'd have to get a truck and trailer in order to get to KC it sounds like, and I would definitely join that organization. I did end up finding a couple of good barns, which makes me feel good too. Thanks again!DeleteRepliesReplyReplyAlicia January 24, 2014 at 3:29 PMBummer about the job, but everything happens for a reason. Cliche I know, but there's a reason everyone says it lol. It is nice to be able to look at your barn and appreciate it though, it's always a nice reality check when I do.ReplyDeleteRepliesJen January 24, 2014 at 6:51 PMI think you're right, and don't worry about the cliche! In this case, I got something out of it (knowing what I need to improve) and things are still good where I am. Win win.DeleteRepliesReplyReplyL.Williams January 24, 2014 at 5:15 PMUnless you move to california :) *elbows* heee heee :DReplyDeleteRepliesJen January 24, 2014 at 6:51 PMSince it's supposed to be even colder than the first polar vortex this week (low of -12 on Tuesday and high of 7) I am THIS CLOSE to hopping on a plane and coming to visit you! Don't tempt me!DeleteRepliesReplyReplyHillary January 24, 2014 at 6:12 PMIt is always good to interview! Sorry you didn't get the job but you should be flattered to be runner up! Companies don't normally go out of their way to say stuff like that unless they mean it in my opinion.ReplyDeleteRepliesJen January 24, 2014 at 6:52 PMThanks! Yeah, I agree. I emailed the guys I interviewed with back and forth a few times, they were really sincere and encouraging about the career path I have chosen and my skills in it. Just need to be a little older. :)DeleteRepliesReplyReplyjenj January 24, 2014 at 9:24 PMSorry to hear that the job didn't work out... fingers crossed that there's something even bigger and better right around the corner! In case you're interested, we have loads of enterprise IT in Austin (I actually work for an enterprise IT management company)... and it's only getting down to 28 tonight. *Hint Hint* The eventing's not bad here either!ReplyDeleteRepliesJen January 24, 2014 at 9:38 PMWarmth is a sincerely motivating factor right now! It's also nice to meet other women in the field. I'd love to talk to you! Could you send me an email at jenifer . slabaugh @ gmail .com?DeleteRepliesReplyReplyT January 25, 2014 at 11:25 AMI've moved for work what's starting to feel like way too often. I hear you on the not wanting to leave a good horsey area thing! Good local horse scene is totally on my checklist and a huge selling feature for me :)Good luck with whatever happens - it sounds like eventer79 has some great connections, just in case!ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAdd commentLoad more...Newer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)Castleberrys ContenderBlog ArchiveBlog Archive January 2021 (14) December 2020 (15) November 2020 (9) October 2020 (12) September 2020 (14) August 2020 (7) July 2020 (6) June 2020 (9) May 2020 (8) April 2020 (6) March 2020 (11) February 2020 (10) January 2020 (3) December 2019 (4) November 2019 (20) October 2019 (12) September 2019 (11) August 2019 (7) July 2019 (5) June 2019 (11) May 2019 (10) April 2019 (9) March 2019 (12) February 2019 (8) January 2019 (13) December 2018 (16) November 2018 (5) October 2018 (11) September 2018 (9) August 2018 (13) July 2018 (13) June 2018 (7) May 2018 (5) April 2018 (14) March 2018 (14) February 2018 (15) January 2018 (12) December 2017 (16) November 2017 (10) October 2017 (14) September 2017 (10) August 2017 (9) July 2017 (13) June 2017 (12) May 2017 (17) April 2017 (8) March 2017 (12) February 2017 (11) January 2017 (9) December 2016 (11) November 2016 (8) October 2016 (10) September 2016 (18) August 2016 (11) July 2016 (13) June 2016 (11) May 2016 (15) April 2016 (9) March 2016 (17) February 2016 (12) January 2016 (16) December 2015 (13) November 2015 (10) October 2015 (11) September 2015 (9) August 2015 (15) July 2015 (12) June 2015 (9) May 2015 (20) April 2015 (19) March 2015 (22) February 2015 (24) January 2015 (22) December 2014 (24) November 2014 (25) October 2014 (27) September 2014 (20) August 2014 (21) July 2014 (24) June 2014 (18) May 2014 (20) April 2014 (16) March 2014 (20) February 2014 (18) January 2014 (19) December 2013 (27) November 2013 (21) October 2013 (14) September 2013 (17) August 2013 (13) July 2013 (16) June 2013 (17) May 2013 (18) April 2013 (23) March 2013 (19) February 2013 (16) January 2013 (16) December 2012 (20) November 2012 (16) October 2012 (11) September 2012 (25) August 2012 (22) July 2012 (13) June 2012 (21) May 2012 (17) April 2012 (15) March 2012 (20) February 2012 (14) January 2012 (19) December 2011 (23) November 2011 (24) October 2011 (6) September 2011 (2) August 2011 (5) July 2011 (2) June 2011 (2) May 2011 (1) April 2011 (5) March 2011 (9) February 2011 (9) January 2011 (6) December 2010 (5) November 2010 (3) July 2010 (6) April 2010 (5) March 2010 (14) January 2010 (3) December 2009 (2)Fellow BloggersA Enter SpookingUphill2 hours agoEquestrian At HartLex Go!3 hours agothe $900 Facebook ponyWhat’s the Point(s)?3 hours agoConfessions of a Dressage BarbieWW: Taj MahTeal (Tack Room) Tour4 hours ago4R RanchCar Camping Box19 hours agoViva CarlosThe Kitchen Sink1 day agoZen and the Art of Baby Horse ManagementI thought we were friends2 days agoCONTACTWe haz been werkin2 days agoTales from a Bad EventerBuy the Video2 days agoParadigm Farms Horse RetirementSunday Pictures2 days agoBel JoeorHouse Post: Sleeping Porch Problems2 days agoOh Gingersnap!A Week In The Sun4 days ago'Fraidy Cat EventingFlashback Friday: Day 1 Chuck5 days agoWyvern OaksHaffie-pass!6 days agoOne Bud WiserCiner Progress Report: A Really Cool Horse1 week agoPONY'TUDEWeird Hugs and Tiny Stabs1 week agoHopeful JumpersGetting Back on Track1 week agoDances With HorsesEarning his keep1 week agoPony ExpressThe Waiting Game1 week agomugwump ChroniclesSummer Break2 weeks agoSprinklerBanditsLooking for Release2 weeks agoEventing Saddlebred StyleLooking Forward3 weeks agoAn Optimist, a Pony, and a Pug2020 Recap3 weeks agoDream BigHappy New Year3 weeks agoEquinpilotRoscoe and I are Inadvertant Liars3 weeks agoStampy and the BrainBlog Hop: 2020 Summary, COVID Edition4 weeks agoIn Omnia ParatusBlog Hop: 2020 Summary; COVID Edition4 weeks agoGuinness on TapMy Coyote ... friend?
