Would you like to help students find their way in the maze that’s called ‘the academic world’?Moïse Veldema (SV Eureka): “Why does a philosophy student decide to build up a whole new scientific journal from the ground? Jobke Visser, Co-Founder of the brand new Journal Of Trial And Error (which recently launched its first complete issue), can tell you all about her experiences in the academic world and why there was a need for a journal like JOTE. We learn a lot from successes as well as our mistakes, that’s why it’s strange that in academia there is so little room and attention for failure. If you are interested in science and publishing papers, you don’t want to miss Jobke’s story.”© 2021 Universiteit Utrecht, Privacy verklaring"
