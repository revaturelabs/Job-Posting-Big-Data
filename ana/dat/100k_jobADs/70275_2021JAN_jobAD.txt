Since its founding over 30 years ago, our company has been built by aggressively reinvesting its earnings into both internal growth and new acquisitions. As a privately held, long term investor, we provide our operations with the resources and stability they require to excel in today’s competitive marketplace. Heico currently operates over 35 businesses. Our core operations are organized into four platforms: Ancra Group, Heico Metal Processing Group, Heico Construction Group, and Pettibone L.L.C. Within these groups, each of our businesses runs on a stand-alone basis. While they have great independence, our companies also benefit from the opportunity to share knowledge about markets, production processes and management practices with any of our other companies. This cooperative structure gives our employees a wealth of information and resources that empowers them to take their businesses to new heights. Heico is privately held and maintains majority ownership in each of its operations. In aggregate, Heico’s businesses generate more than $2 billion in revenues.
