Most of us have many skills but, it’s important to think about them as valuable commodities and honing in on those gifts, so that we can add income streams to them in order to create more opportunities for ourselves.Now whether those opportunities lie in the idea of opening new doors career-wise, or whether we are talking about more opportunities for us to buy more of what we need or desire in life, there is no denying it, that it’s a benefit all-round to monetize upon our knowledge!Whether you are excellent at baking cakes, great at training dogs, a skilled writer or are great at fixing things around the house, you certainly have a skill that you can market and people will gladly pay you to do so! Some may find it hard to imagine, but it’s simpler than you may think.If you don’t think you have any skills, trust me you do! It doesn’t have to be something you’re necessarily passionate about. It can just be some skill that interests you and that you have a fair amount of knowledge, excitement and insight into.So, what can you do to start this new venture?Set a goal of what you’d like to accomplish using this skill. For example, if you’re a skilled dog trainer who has experience potty training dogs, that could be a service that you could offer. Set a goal of when you’ll begin this new venture and the set amount of time on average that it takes to train each dog based on your years of experience.Document your plan and ask yourself why what you’re offering is going to be important for your market.Are there people in dire need of your offer? If you respond with a yes, and you know that people are feeling frustrated not having access to what you have to offer, then you’re onto something that has the potential to become a very big income source for you.Now, once you see there is a definite need; then market that to prospective clients in need of your product or service.Remember, nothing has to be set in stone. Just start and see where things go. Successful entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals know that change is inevitable in business. You may start your service in potty training dogs, but may then venture out into new areas based on the various demands from your clients, your existing skills or new opportunities that may come your way. And these opportunities may be ones you may have never thought of when you had originally started your service.You may also realize areas of the business that you enjoy doing more than others. These all could mean new opportunities to leverage, grow and expand. You may even experience more ways to meet your original business goal in a very unexpected way. But here’s the thing… Once you begin, you’d be surprised by what may be in store for you!If you have a skill, but are unsure how to market it, you can get a step-by-step plan to help put your idea into perspective.
