These include online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, software, and hardware. Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, in California.It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs, Sheets and Slides), email (Gmail/Inbox), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), social networking (Google+), instant messaging and video chat (Google Allo/Duo), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and turn-by-turn navigation (Google Maps/Waze), video sharing (YouTube), notetaking (Google Keep), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system, the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its Nexus devices, and in October 2016, it released multiple hardware products (including the Google Pixel smartphone, Home smart speaker, Wifi mesh wireless router, and Daydream View virtual reality headset). The new hardware chief, Rick Osterloh, stated: \"a lot of the innovation that we want to do now ends up requiring controlling the end-to-end user experience\". Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier. In February 2010, it announced Google Fiber, a fiber-optic infrastructure that was installed in Kansas City; in April 2015, it launched Project Fi in the United States, combining Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different providers; and in 2016, it announced the Google Station initiative to make public Wi-Fi around the world, with initial deployment in India.People also viewedSenior Data EngineerMcKinsey NCR,Delhi,IndiaMcKinsey is looking for a Senior Data Engineer who has experience and interest in cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, Goole Platform, or Databricksks.177 days ago | 5763 ViewsFull-stack DevelopmentNutanix Bangalore,Karnataka,IndiaNutanix is seeking for the Full-stack Development developer who has the ability to write scripts and tools for development and debugging.177 days ago | 5601 ViewsArtificial IntelligenceGoogle NCR,Delhi,IndiaGoogle is hiring for an Artificial Intelligence professional who has 5 years of experience as a technical sales engineer in a cloud computing environment or equivalent experience in a customer-facing role.183 days ago | 5715 ViewsSystems Test EngineerSamsung Menlo Park,CA,California,USASamsung is looking for system engineer, who has hands-on ability to establish and demonstrate new technology.245 days ago | 6864 ViewsSimilar JobsSenior Data EngineerMcKinsey NCR,Delhi,IndiaMcKinsey is looking for a Senior Data Engineer who has experience and interest in cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, Goole Platform, or Databricksks.177 days ago | 5763 ViewsFull-stack DevelopmentNutanix Bangalore,Karnataka,IndiaNutanix is seeking for the Full-stack Development developer who has the ability to write scripts and tools for development and debugging.177 days ago | 5601 ViewsArtificial IntelligenceGoogle NCR,Delhi,IndiaGoogle is hiring for an Artificial Intelligence professional who has 5 years of experience as a technical sales engineer in a cloud computing environment or equivalent experience in a customer-facing role.183 days ago | 5715 ViewsSystems Test EngineerSamsung Menlo Park,CA,California,USASamsung is looking for system engineer, who has hands-on ability to establish and demonstrate new technology.245 days ago | 6864 ViewsVALUEFIRST DIGITAL MEDIA PVT.
