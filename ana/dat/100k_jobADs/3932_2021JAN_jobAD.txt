I have recently lost most my Job and I was feeling depressed about it because of the length of time it is taking so far to obtain a new one? I have thoughts keep popping up of not being able to cover my expenses to look after my family and sometimes resentment. My question is please explain from the guidance of the Holy Quran and examples of noble prophets, how should we as Muslims deal with it; should I just be patient and accept I am being tested and is part of my destiny? Many thanks and pray to Allah for great rewards for your tremendous work.Allah Says in the Holy Quran Chapter 2 Surah Baqarah verses 155-157:155 Be sure We shall test you with something of fear, and hunger, some loss in goods, or lives, or the fruits (of your toil); but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere.156 Who say when afflicted with calamity: \"To Allah we belong and to Him is our return.\"157 They are those on whom (descend) blessings from Allah and Mercy, and they are the ones that receive guidance.Dear and Beloved Brother in Islam, there is absolutely no doubt that Allah Subhanah has Decreed a set of tests of each amongst mankind for a period of one short transient life time on this earth. Man has absolutely no control on the quality, quantity, or the severity of the test bestowed and Decreed upon him by His All-Knowing, All-Wise Lord; what man does have control over, and what each amongst mankind will be responsible for in the Majestic Presence of his All-Just Lord is what did he do in the tests and conditions laid upon him by His Lord.Whether one strikes a deal which earns him millions of dollars, or one looses everything one possesses in a split-second; both are in a test: one to see whether he is grateful to his Lord for the favors bestowed upon him or does he get proud and arrogant at his success, and the other to see whether he is patient in his adversity or gets impatient and despairs of the Lord’s infinite Mercy and Grace!Allah Says in the Holy Quran Chapter 2 Surah Baqarah verse 286:286 On no soul doth Allah place a burden greater than it can bear. It gets every good that it earns and it suffers every ill that it earns. (Pray): \"Our Lord! condemn us not if we forget or fall into error; our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which Thou didst lay on those before us; Our Lord! lay not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Blot out our sins and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. Thou art our Protector; help us against those who stand against faith.\"It is nothing but the Unending Mercy and Grace of the All-Wise, All-Knowing Lord that He does not bestow a test or a burden on anyone more than one can bear! Everyone is tested by the All-Wise according to his capability to bear the test; the biggest tests being laid upon the Prophets of Allah, then on the most pious after them, and then on the most pious after them!Your Question: My question is please explain from the guidance of the Holy Quran and examples of noble prophets,The Messenger of Allah said in an authentic narration: ‘The Biggest trials are on the Prophets, then on those closest in piety after them, then on closest in piety after them….’.Dear and Beloved Brother in Islam, the whole Quran is full of the tests that Allah laid on His Prophets and how these noblest of all souls passed the severe tests and trials laid upon them in humility and fear of their Lord All-Mighty. We are sincerely at a loss of words regarding whose examples should we relate to you:Should we relate the example of Prophet Nuh (a.s.) who invited his people to follow the Truth for a period of 950 long years and only a handful of them believed!Or should we relate the example of the Khaleel (Closest Friend) of Allah Subhanah, the father of the Prophets, Prophet Ibraheem (a.s.) who was sentenced to death by the evil King Nimrod and thrown by a catapult in a blazing fire, who was the first Prophet to migrate in the Cause of Allah inviting people to the Truth, who was childless until an abject old age but kept his complete and unshakeable trust and belief in his Lord Alone, who when commanded left his wife and infant son in the barren valley of Makkah, who was then put to the ultimate test in a dream by Allah to sacrifice his young son for Allah Subhanah and he did not flinch!Or should we relate the example of Prophet Ayyub (a.s.) who lost his kingdom, his wealth, his children, his health, everything that he ever possessed; but displayed such patience and belief and trust in his Lord, that his patience became an example for all mankind until the end of time!Or should we relate the example of Prophet Yusuf (a.s.) who was betrayed by his brothers, thrown in a well, sold as a slave, and then thrown in jail for a long period on a fictitious charge!Or should we relate the example of the Prophet Musa (a.s.) in his encounters with the evilest of all evil, the Firaun?Or should we relate the example of the Noble Prophet Isa (a.s.) and the conspiracies hatched against him by the disbelieving Jews?Or should we relate the example of all examples of the severe tests, trials, tribulations and afflictions that were laid upon the Imaam of all the Prophets, the Last and Final Messenger of Allah, Mohamed ibn-Abdullah (saws)?The Messenger of Allah (saws) said in an authentic narration: “Let the trials that have afflicted me be a consolation to you in your trials!”Your Question: should I just be patient and accept I am being tested and is part of my destiny?Allah Says in the Holy Quran Chapter 29 Surah Ankabut verse 62:62 Allah enlarges the sustenance (which He gives) to whichever of His servants He pleases; and He (similarly) grants by (strict) measure (as He pleases): for Allah has full knowledge of all things.Dear and Beloved Brother in Islam, there is absolutely no doubt that your condition is no more than a test laid upon your Lord to see what His believing slave does when put in a certain condition. Indeed, my beloved brother, accept this is nothing more than a passing test of life, be grateful for all the favors your Lord has provided you and your family, put your complete trust and belief in the Power and Strength of your Lord Most Merciful, and above all be patient in your adversity and believe with absolute conviction that your Lord is well aware of your condition and supplicate and invoke none except Him to relieve you of your affliction.Sahih Al-Bukhari HadithHadith 7.565 Narrated byAbdullahThe Messenger of Allah (saws) said: “No Muslim is afflicted with any harm, but that his sins will be annulled just as the leaves of a tree fall down.\"My beloved and dear Brother in Islam, this terms of ‘depression’ and ‘stress’, etc. are diseases of the hearts and minds only for those who have lost hope and despair of the Unending Mercies and Bounties of Allah Subhanah. How can one who sincerely believes in Allah and the Last Day, and in constant hope of His Unending and Infinite Mercy ever be depressed or have stress?Suhaib ibn Sinan narrated that the Prophet (saws) said: \"How remarkable is the case of the believer! There is good for him in everything, but this is not the case for anyone except for the believer! When the believer receives any good, he is thankful to Allah, and gets a reward; and when some misfortune befalls him, he endures it patiently, for which he is (also) rewarded.\"Beloved Brother, be patient in the trial your Lord has chosen for you, never ever despair or lose hope of His Unending Benevolence and Mercy towards His believing slaves, and remain constant in your invocation and supplication to Him and Him Alone and implore none but Him Alone to make your trial easy for you, and relieve from you your affliction in the most honorable and best manner.Al-Tirmidhi Hadith 79 Narrated by Umar ibn al-KhattabUmar heard the Prophet (saws) say: 'If you put your faith completely in Allah, He will arrange for your sustenance in the same way as He provides for the birds. They go out in the morning with their stomachs empty and return filled in the evening!'Related Answers:Cannot find the job, is this test from Allah?Working in music dance academy.Work in auto industry.I am working in hotel industry where by as the nature of hospitality we have bar in the hotel where by we received our salary from the hotel is it haram?Work in films.Recommended answers for you:Who created Allah?Please explain when Tawaf Al Wida (Farewell Tawaf) is obligatory.Zina repentance.Stock Market Halaal or Haraam?Huqooq ul ibaad.Thanking Allah for His Many BlessingsEmail this articleAbout Us | Contact Us | Feedback | PrivacyOur ProductWisterCopyright © 2021 Islamhelpline All rights reserved×Email this articleRecipient's Email Address: * e.g. you@domain.com (Maximum 10 emails are allowed seperated by comma)Sender's Name:Sender's Email Address:Do not send my name and email addressAre you a robot: *CloseSend Email"
