Here are several ways to examine the job outlook for hotel management positions.Related resource: Top 15 Hospitality Management Bachelor’s Degree Online ProgramsOverall Job Outlook for Hotel ManagementIn 2018, there were an estimated 52,600 jobs in lodging management in the United States. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that in 2028, that number will go up to about 53,100. The difference is about a 1 percent gain in job openings, which is less than the expected gain for all types of office management jobs and much lower than the expected growth for all jobs in the United States. There are a few reasons for the slow growth rate, including consolidation of hotel chains, chains buying up hotels that were formerly independent and faster growth of international tourism versus domestic tourism.Job Outlook By Type of Lodging or HotelAnother way to examine the job outlook for hotel management is by the type of lodging or hotel. Hotels that are attached to convention centers or that offer large meeting facilities will continue to grow, and they may offer more management jobs. Hotels that operate a resort or that are part of an existing resort will also have high occupancy rates, which translates to a need for managers of the general staff. Upscale hotels that offer a wide range of customer services will also have opportunities for management positions.Job Outlook by City, State or Territory of the United StatesDifferent parts of the country have different levels of tourism, and another important way to consider the job outlook for hotel management is by city, state or territory of the United States. In general, metropolitan areas have higher concentrations of hotels and higher hotel occupancy levels than suburban and rural areas, so cities will offer more job opportunities. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the cities with the best job prospects for hotel management positions include Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, New York and Washington, D.C. California, Texas, Florida, New York, Tennessee, and Texas are the states with the most jobs in hotel management.How a Candidate Can Improve Their Job ProspectsA candidate can improve their prospect of getting a hotel management job by earning a bachelor’s degree in hospitality or hotel management. Being bilingual would also benefit a person who wants to go into the management of hotels. Some experience in different types of work within a hotel could also give a person a career boost into a management position.Understanding the potential for growth in hotel management jobs in different parts of the United States is a good first step in deciding on a career path. A person might also be interested in working outside of the United States after earning their degree, and each nation’s labor department or similar organization should make available some statistics about their job openings, and multi-national hotel chains headquartered in the United States may do this, too. Knowing the answer to, “How is the job outlook for hotel management?” could help a person decide where to move and which jobs to consider.Find Your Degree Select a Degree Level Select a DegreeAssociate'sBachelor'sMaster'sDoctorateNon-Degree CoursesCertificate / DiplomaGraduate Certificates Select a Category Select a CategoryArt & DesignBusiness & ManagementComputers & TechnologyCriminal Justice & LegalEducation & TeachingLiberal Arts & HumanitiesNursing & HealthcarePsychology & CounselingScience & EngineeringTrades & Careers Select a Subject Select a Subject AnimationArt & Art HistoryCreative / DesignFashionFilmGame DesignGraphic DesignInterior DesignLandscape ArchitectureMultimedia DesignPhotographyVisual CommunicationsWeb Design AccountingBusiness AdministrationBusiness IntelligenceEconomicsEntertainment ManagementEntrepreneurshipFinanceForensic AccountingHospitality ManagementHotel & Restaurant ManagementHuman ResourcesInternational BusinessInternet MarketingLogisticsManagementManagement Information SystemsMarketingNon-Profit ManagementOrganizational LeadershipProject ManagementPublic RelationsReal EstateRetail & Sales ManagementRisk ManagementSmall BusinessSports ManagementSupply Chain & LogisticsTaxationTraining & Development Computer EngineeringComputer ForensicsComputer ProgrammingComputer ScienceDatabase ManagementInformation Systems SecurityInformation TechnologyInternet SecurityMobile DevelopmentNetwork AdministrationNetwork SecuritySoftware EngineeringWeb Development CorrectionsCrime Scene InvestigationCriminal JusticeCriminologyCyber SecurityForensic ScienceHomeland SecurityLaw EnforcementLegal StudiesParalegalPublic Safety Administration Adult Education/LearningChild DevelopmentCoachingCurriculum & InstructionEarly Childhood EducationEducationEducational AdministrationEducational CounselingEducational LeadershipEducational TechnologyElementary EducationEnglish Language LearningHigher EducationK-12 EducationLibrary ScienceMath EducationMusic EducationOnline TeachingReading & LiteracySpecial EducationTeacher Licensure AnthropologyCommunicationsEnglishGeneral StudiesGeographyHistoryHuman & Family DevelopmentJournalismLiberal ArtsMedia CommunicationsMinistryMusicPolitical SciencePublic AdministrationPublic PolicySocial ScienceSocial WorkSociologyTheologyWriting Dental AssistanceEmergency ManagementGerontologyHealth EducationHealth InformaticsHealth ScienceHealth ServicesHealthcare AdministrationHealthcare ManagementHuman ServicesMedical AssistingMedical CodingMedical Office AdministrationNurse Practitioner (RN Required)Nursing (RN required)Nursing Education (RN Required)Nutritional SciencesPharmacyPublic HealthRN to BSN (RN required)Sports MedicineSports Medicine/Physical TherapyVeterinaryX-Ray Technician Addictions & RecoveryBehavioral PsychologyChild and Adolescent PsychologyCounselingEducational PsychologyFamily CounselingForensic PsychologyOrganizational PsychologyPsychology Aeronautics/AviationBiomedical EngineeringCivil EngineeringDraftingElectronics EngineeringEngineeringEngineering ManagementEnvironmental ManagementEnvironmental ScienceIndustrial EngineeringMechanical Engineering AutomotiveCarpentryConstruction ManagementCulinaryElectrical TechnicianFire ScienceHeating/CoolingTechnologyTradesSearch NowADBesthospitalitydegrees.com is an advertising-supported site.
