It bugged me very long time but finally I got that.I hope that someone will benefit from this,CheersDHQI.gr Nikolaos Hatzistelios - Check our DHQI Video Voicer app for creating voiceovers for video presentations of your appsDHQI.Nikos, Facebook Messenger,LinkedIn ,DHQI.gr,www.dhqi.grMy contributions to the communityGod lies in the equations - Everyone is innocent until proven guiltyYou must log in or register to reply here.Share:Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Tumblr WhatsApp Email LinkHomeForumsB4i - iOSiOS QuestionsContact usTerms and rulesPrivacy policyHelpHomeRSSForum software by XenForo® © 2010-2020 XenForo Ltd.This site uses cookies to help personalise content, tailor your experience and to keep you logged in if you register.By continuing to use this site, you are consenting to our use of cookies.Accept Learn more…Top"
