This is major abdominal surgery and can lead to post-surgical complications for the mother, but in some cases it may be the only way to safely deliver the baby.The mother’s mammary glands go through changes during the third trimester to prepare for lactation and breastfeeding. When the baby begins suckling at the breast, signals are sent to the hypothalamus causing the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary. Prolactin causes the mammary glands to produce milk. Oxytocin is also released, promoting the release of the milk. The milk contains nutrients for the baby’s development and growth as well as immunoglobulins to protect the child from bacterial and viral infections.Contraception and birth controlThe prevention of a pregnancy comes under the terms contraception or birth control. Strictly speaking, contraception refers to preventing the sperm and egg from joining. Both terms are, however, frequently used interchangeably.Contraceptive MethodsMethodExamplesFailure Rate in Typical Use Over 12 MonthsBarrier male condom, female condom, sponge, cervical cap, diaphragm, spermicides 15 to 24%Hormonal oral, patch, vaginal ring 8%injection 3%implant less than 1%Other natural family planning 12 to 25%withdrawal 27%sterilization less than 1%[link] lists common methods of contraception. The failure rates listed are not the ideal rates that could be realized, but the typical rates that occur. A failure rate is the number of pregnancies resulting from the method’s use over a twelve-month period. Barrier methods, such as condoms, cervical caps, and diaphragms, block sperm from entering the uterus, preventing fertilization. Spermicides are chemicals that are placed in the vagina that kill sperm. Sponges, which are saturated with spermicides, are placed in the vagina at the cervical opening. Combinations of spermicidal chemicals and barrier methods achieve lower failure rates than do the methods when used separately.Nearly a quarter of the couples using barrier methods, natural family planning, or withdrawal can expect a failure of the method. Natural family planning is based on the monitoring of the menstrual cycle and having intercourse only during times when the egg is not available. A woman’s body temperature may rise a degree Celsius at ovulation and the cervical mucus may increase in volume and become more pliable. These changes give a general indication of when intercourse is more or less likely to result in fertilization. Withdrawal involves the removal of the penis from the vagina during intercourse, before ejaculation occurs. This is a risky method with a high failure rate due to the possible presence of sperm in the bulbourethral gland’s secretion, which may enter the vagina prior to removing the penis.Hormonal methods use synthetic progesterone (sometimes in combination with estrogen), to inhibit the hypothalamus from releasing FSH or LH, and thus prevent an egg from being available for fertilization. The method of administering the hormone affects failure rate. The most reliable method, with a failure rate of less than 1 percent, is the implantation of the hormone under the skin. The same rate can be achieved through the sterilization procedures of vasectomy in the man or of tubal ligation in the woman, or by using an intrauterine device (IUD). IUDs are inserted into the uterus and establish an inflammatory condition that prevents fertilized eggs from implanting into the uterine wall.Questions & AnswersWhat is the law of demandYaw Replyprice increase demand decrease...price decrease demand increaseMujahidıf the price increase the demand decrease and if the demand increase the price decreaseMUBARAKall other things being equal, an increase in demand causes a decrease in supply and vice versaSETHUAHyahJohnsonhow is the economy of usa nowJohnsonJoin the discussion...ReplyWhat is demandjude ReplyDemand is the quantity of goods and services a consumer is willing and able to purchase at various prices over a given period of time.YawyeaSETHUAHOkay congratulations I'll join you guys later .AjyesMUBARAKJoin the discussion...Replycalculate elasticity of income exercisesHABANABAKIZE ReplyJoin the discussion...ReplyIf potatoes cost Jane $1 per kilogram and she has $5 that could possibly spend on potatoes or other items.
