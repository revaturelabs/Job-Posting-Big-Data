About 21,000 jobs in the industry were added during the month, roughly consistent with gains in the industry over the past year.The construction numbers are particularly encouraging given how grim things looked on the new-construction front just a few weeks ago, following the release of May’s new construction numbers. That report showed only about a fourth of what today’s count demonstrates, with only about 4,000 construction jobs added during the month.Many watchers of the market have pegged new construction as the best way out of a squeeze in available homes for sale. Upon seeing May’s numbers, National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun sounded off on the significance of a weak new construction market. “One slow sector, but with huge potential for many months of expansion, is in the housing sector. There is a housing shortage. More homebuilding means more hiring of people in the construction sector and thereby will provide a boost to local economies,” he said.A chronic shortage of workers has been a major contributing factor holding back the potential of construction. The falling unemployment rate in the industry has outpaced the decline in the overall unemployment rate by a significant margin since the collapse of the housing market roughly a decade ago, and economists worry that there may simply not be much more available labor for the industry to tap into. This May, construction payrolls increased by 203,000 from a year earlier, which was the slowest 12-month change so far in 2019 and was more than a third slower than the average monthly gain throughout 2018.Posted In: National NewsTags: Bureau of Labors StatisticsRelated articlesRE/MAX home sales up 22%read moreGuaranteed Rate acquires Stearns Holdings, LLCread moreHome price appreciation skyrockets nationwideread moreCommenting is not available unless JavaScript is enabled.Join the conversation Cancel replyCancel replySave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.Meet Who's Who in Atlanta Real EstateNaveed BhurgriMOST POPULARLocal NewsWho made the Top 10 Who’s Who profiles for 2020?TrendsHere’s what 2021 buyers want in a kitchenAgent News, Improving Your Business, Local NewsAtlanta real estate leaders talk 2021Local NewsWhich agents were turning heads in our 2020 Agent Snapshot?Current Market DataSuper sellers’ market may hinder affordability outlook for 2021RESOURCE GUIDETechnologyHow to grow your real estate brand with CRMsBusiness DevelopmentBecome a top producer with a business plan that works for youBest PracticesLearn and get certified on the fundamentals of real estateAssistantsTrain and certify your assistant for successAdvertising TermsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy PolicyComment PolicyContact UsPress RoomCopyright © 2021 Atlanta Agent magazine.
