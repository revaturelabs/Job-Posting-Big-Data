Previous project|Next project ?1 of 71 of 7Signal HouseWashington, DCSignal House at Union Market is a pioneering project—at the scale of the city, neighborhood, building, and brand. Fully connected to the neighborhood, the 225,000 SF, eleven-story trophy office building is unlike any another office building in the city. Alternating double-height corner terraces and panoramic views of the Capitol give each floor a unique connection to the outdoors, while creating varied experiences on each side of the building. An offset core puts people in the center and offers more open and flexible spaces. Signal House will feature private terraces, a windowed conference center, state-of-the-art fitness facilities, below-grade parking, secure bike storage, 11,000 RSF of premium retail, and a rooftop boasting a DJ booth, karaoke room, kitchen, bar, and views of the Capitol.ExpertiseBrand Design ?Consulting & Real Estate Services ?Developer ?Digital Experience Design ?Related ContentPublicationMixed Use and the...Cities large and small are turning to mixed use to...SustainabilitySustainability | Research...Impact by Design 2017 is Gensler’s second annual...Dialogue issueDialogue 34: How Workplace is Shaping the...From incubating new ideas to addressing climate change...BlogWant Your Organization to...Today, encouraging creativity is a must in every...OfficeWashington, D.C.2020 K Street, NWWashington D.C. 20006Phone: +1 202.721.5200PodcastThe Future of Work is...In today’s episode of the Gensler Design Exchange...ShareTwitterFacebookLinkedInEmailContactGensler Fact SheetSite MapNewsletterDiversityTop of page© 2020 Gensler, All Rights Reserved Privacy Statement & Cookie Policy Transparency StatementPlease enable JavaScript to experience the full functionality of www.jobs63.com一本之道高清无码视频_韩国三级电影_香港三级韩国三级日本三级"
