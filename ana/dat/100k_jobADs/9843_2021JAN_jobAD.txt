While they may not always make the best-dressed list, they do require a certain breed of celebrity to pull off. Not only do you have to have the balls to risk a wardrobe malfunction, but you have to do it with enough confidence that you look fierce — not terrified — in the photographs. Take Naomi Campbell's appearance in Valentino's couture show during the spring/summer 2019 presentation. The legendary model gracefully strutted down the runway in a see-through gown with a ruffle skirt. (Click through the gallery for the NSFW photo).

Breaking news, relationship updates, hairstyle inspo, fashion trends, and more direct to your inbox! Let's not forget Rihanna’s infamous CFDA dress either. The girl rocked a completely sheer dress without a bra — and later remarked that her only regret was not wearing a bedazzled thong to match. That, my friends, is dedication. Then, there was the year 2015, when the Met Gala saw not one nor two but three naked dresses on the red carpet, all worn by Hollywood’s hottest A-listers. Jennifer Lopez, above, bared her famous curves in a custom Atelier Versace illusion gown. Beyoncé was nearly naked in Givenchy. And Kim Kardashian West almost looked modest in comparison in her sheer Roberto Cavalli dress, because no one’s getting naked without KKW joining in.

This decade's first big hair trends include looks at every length that can be tailored to your hair texture and personal style. For anyone with a blunt bob — the most popular haircut of the past few years — you probably already guessed that the cut will still be going strong into the next decade. But there will be a few tweaks. As seen on Kerry Washington, 2020's bob has textured, softer edges, and looks amazing whether you part it down the middle or off to the side. RELATED: The 10 Hairstyles You'll See Everywhere This Winter But if you swear that 2020 is going to be the year you finally grow out your hair, let Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian's extra-long lengths be your inspiration.

But her moniker is quite the opposite of her reality: Appealing to her 2.8 million Instagram followers, keeping an active Snapchat presence, and co-hosting a popular morning show are all part of her day-to-day tasks.So, how did “Girl With No Job” turn social media into a full-time business? It didn't happen overnight. “I would say the first two [years] were really instrumental in creating a good foundation. I wasn’t making any money, it was basically a hobby,” Oshry says. “About the third year is when I kind of started to realize it was a business opportunity, more so than a hobby. The first brand to reach out was Burger King. They paid me $1,000 and I was shook to my core.”These days for Claudia, $1,000 for a sponsored post is on the low end. She has worked with brands like Diet Coke and Captain Morgan, but won’t reveal the exact figures she makes. “You can definitely make an honest living on Instagram,” she says. “I just have been kind of learning as I go and creating, basically making up my own rules, which is super fun.”By Claire NolanCloseShare optionsInStyle InStyleMagazines & MoreLearn MoreSubscribe this link opens in a new tabContact UsAdvertiseAccolades LicensingContent LicensingSitemapConnectFollow UsSubscribe to Our NewsletterOther Meredith SitesCloseOther Meredith Sites4 Your Health this link opens in a new tabAllrecipes this link opens in a new tabAll People Quilt this link opens in a new tabBetter Homes & Gardens this link opens in a new tabBizrate Insights this link opens in a new tabBizrate Surveys this link opens in a new tabCooking Light this link opens in a new tabDaily Paws this link opens in a new tabEatingWell this link opens in a new tabEat This, Not That this link opens in a new tabEntertainment Weekly this link opens in a new tabFood & Wine this link opens in a new tabHealth this link opens in a new tabHello Giggles this link opens in a new tabMartha Stewart this link opens in a new tabMidwest Living this link opens in a new tabMore this link opens in a new tabMyRecipes this link opens in a new tabMyWedding this link opens in a new tabMy Food and Family this link opens in a new tabMyLife this link opens in a new tabParenting this link opens in a new tabParents this link opens in a new tabPeople this link opens in a new tabPeople en Español this link opens in a new tabRachael Ray Magazine this link opens in a new tabReal Simple this link opens in a new tabSer Padres this link opens in a new tabShape this link opens in a new tabSiempre Mujer this link opens in a new tabSouthern Living this link opens in a new tabSwearBy this link opens in a new tabTravel & Leisure this link opens in a new tabInStyle is part of the Meredith Beauty Group. © Copyright 2021 Meredith Corporation.
