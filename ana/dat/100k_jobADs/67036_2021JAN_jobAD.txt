Not at all of the same calibre as Socialist intellectuals.Here below is the first kindQuote:Readout of the President’s Call with President PutinPresident Putin called President Obama today to discuss the U.S. proposal for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis in Ukraine, which Secretary Kerry had again presented to Foreign Minister Lavrov at the meeting at the Hague earlier this week, and which we developed following U.S. consultations with our Ukrainian and European partners. President Obama suggested that Russia put a concrete response in writing and the presidents agreed that Kerry and Lavrov would meet to discuss next steps.President Obama noted that the Ukrainian government continues to take a restrained and de-escalatory approach to the crisis and is moving ahead with constitutional reform and democratic elections, and urged Russia to support this process and avoid further provocations, including the buildup of forces on its border with Ukraine.President Obama underscored to President Putin that the United States continues to support a diplomatic path in close consultation with the Government of Ukraine and in support of the Ukrainian people with the aim of de-escalation of the crisis. President Obama made clear that this remains possible only if Russia pulls back its troops and does not take any steps to further violate Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. President Obama reiterated that the United States has strongly opposed the actions that Russia has already taken to violate Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/28/readout-president-s-call-president-putinI wonder how the other kind of intellectuals, the ones in Moscow, review this call.Back to topjohnslatJoined: 21 Jan 2003Posts: 13859Location: Santa Fe, New Mexico, USAPosted: Sun Mar 30, 2014 3:38 pm Post subject:Dear wonderingjoesmithThey might, perhaps, think that, on occasion, historical inevitability could need a gentle push.Regards,JohnBack to topSashadroogieJoined: 17 Apr 2007Posts: 11061Location: Moskva, The Workers' ParadisePosted: Sun Mar 30, 2014 3:44 pm Post subject:Dear JohnslatThe word is 'guidance', not pushing.
