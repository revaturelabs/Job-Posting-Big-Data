It has also been complicated by rival suppliers complaining they have been shut out of the programme and that Artec’s proposals would not offer as much work to the UK supply chain as theirs.In an attempt to make Boxer more politically attractive, Artec has signed deals with suppliers including BAE Systems, Thales UK and Pearson Engineering that mean 60pc by value of the contract will be done in Britain, along with final assembly of the MIVs.Artec has been trying to promote the benefits Boxer will bring to the UK supply chainArtec says that if it is awarded the MIV contract, its structure means 300 jobs will be created in Britain working on the design, development and manufacturing of the Boxer. A further 700 jobs will be created in the supply chain, it claims.It is understood Artec will use the UK plants it owns or has existing partnerships with in Stockport, Oxfordshire, Bristol and the Isle of Wight.Versions of Boxer used by other countries are powered by MTU engines, the Rolls-Royce owned business.Because German companies lead Artec, Boxer has faced political battles in the UK. A defence industry source added: “Boxer has been slow in selling its British industrial story and heritage, plus its promise of UK jobs but they’ve now come out fighting.”A spokesman for BAE confirmed the defence giant had signed the deal with Artec, saying it “formalised our intent to provide a significant part of the work from the UK if Boxer is chosen.”BAE’s combat vehicles facility in Telford is likely to be the primary site for its work on the programme.Related TopicsDefence industryGermanyBritish ArmyIndustryShow moreFollow The TelegraphFacebook icon Follow on FacebookTwitter icon Follow on TwitterInstagram icon Follow on InstagramLinkedIn icon Follow on LinkedInShow commentsYou need to be a subscriber to join the conversation.
