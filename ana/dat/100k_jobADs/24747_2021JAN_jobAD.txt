Lease Purchase drivers have more control over work hours, jobs accepted, and routes driven than Company Drivers, but not as much control as Owner-Operators.Carriers frequently offer lease purchase options to drivers. Under a Lease-Purchase arrangement, the carrier likely owns the truck but enters into an agreement with the driver in which the truck is leased to the driver for a fixed or variable fee (as specified in the least agreement). The driver pays the leasing fee, a portion of which goes to pay down the “principal” and a portion goes to an agreed upon interest rate. If the driver remains with the lease long enough, the full original value of the truck will be paid off, and the driver assumes ownership of the truck.A driver exploring lease-purchase arrangement should research various carriers or company-specific information. They should compare the pros and cons of each, look closely at those that appear to best match their level of acceptable risk, their abilities to operate a business, their forecasted expenses, and their lifestyle.What are some personal characteristics helpful for Lease-Purchase Drivers?Lease-Purchase drivers will find that a blend of traits needed of Company Drivers and Owner Operators will serve them well as they take a step toward self-employment. Aside from the personal characteristics needed to be a good truck driver, lease-purchase drivers are also faced with the need for business savvy, accounting and bookkeeping knowledge, experience with taxes, and an ability to remain up to date with current and forecast trends in the freight transport industries.For additional information about Lease-Purchase Drivers, including what is a Lease-Purchase Driver, pathways to securing a driving job, financial investment requirements, personal characteristics, average salaries and compensation structures of Lease-Purchase Drivers, visit Truck Driving Job Resources.Information about Team DriversTeam DriversThe information below provides insight into how working as a Team Driver may meet your expected lifestyle, work into your long-term career plans, and provide the working environment you seek.What is a Team Driver?A team driver is a driver operating with a partner who shares driving duties and other tasks with the other partner. Delivery is much faster than utilizing a single driver, as Hours of Service regulations can be met for one driver while the other is resting. Team drivers often consist of spouses driving together or partners in an owner-operator situation. Likewise, an owner-operator may hire on another driver for the sole purpose of serving as part of a two-man team.In some cases, a team can be formed by two individuals who may own a truck together or when one works for the other driver. But more frequently team drivers are the result of carrier or company programs that pair up drivers to provide the benefits a team arrangement offers. Of course, these teams must be carefully selected and monitored. People do not get along for a variety of reasons. A team that gets along well, communicates, and has similar goals and expectations of the job is going to be far more efficient and productive than a team that does not like driving together.What personal characteristics are need for Team Drivers?There is nothing as important to team driving as the personal relationships built between the partners. Aside from the personal characteristics needed to be a good truck driver, a Team Driver must be able to work day-in and day-out with a partner. You’ll likely recognize that a team driving arrangement complicates and trumps any other issue you may run into in terms of personal characteristics.For additional information about Team Drivers, including what is a Team Driver, pathways to securing a driving job, financial investment requirements, personal characteristics, average salaries and compensation structures of Team Drivers, visit Truck Driving Job Resources.Information about Reefer/Refrigerated HaulingDifferent types of materials require different types of trailers, and each type of trailer offers drivers its own challenges. Therefore, it is important to understand what is required to not only drive your truck and your freight, but the trailer you are pulling as well.What is “reefer” or “refrigerated” hauling?Refrigerated trailers are those most often hauling food products that must be kept at low temperatures to prevent perishing. Drivers of reefers may operation within a region, or they may travel cross-country routes in performing their jobs. Driving a reefer, as opposed to a dry van, requires additional skills and responsibilities. Monitoring temperatures within the trailer is a vital task of reefer drivers, as if they vary from a specific range as determined by the product carried. Drivers should be skilled in identifying problems with equipment and making minor repairs as well as calling and waiting for repair help. A reefer driver may make several stops along a route to offload products at grocery stores, convenience stores, and other retail locations.What characteristics does a reefer/refrigerated driver need?Along with the personality traits need for most driving positions, reefer drivers need to realize and accept the level of responsibility involved in hauling refrigerated products. Depending on the product, a reefer may carry products with a total value of hundreds of thousands of dollars to retailers that rely on a steady supply of refrigerated items to meet consumer demand. Delays in shipments hurt the carriers as well as the retailers.Often, reefer drivers will be responsible for offloading a certain number of boxes or cargo at various locations. A level of strength and endurance is necessary, as is a conscious effort to protect the product from breaking, being crush, or otherwise damaged.What endorsements are needed to haul refrigerated goods?Reefer drivers can typically perform their jobs with a CDL appropriate for the truck being driven. No specific endorsements are normally required unless the trailers use atypical refrigeration systems involving hazardous materials.For more information about Reefer/Refrigerated Hauling, including what type of companies hire, job requirements, compensation structures, what endorsements are needed, visit Truck Driving Job Resources.Information about Over the Road (OTR) RoutesTruck driving route type vary within the industry and are dependent on several factors including interstate trucking requirements, route planning, type of cargo hauled, frequency, hazardous materials restrictions, driver experience, etc.Over the Road (OTR) Routes are likely those that most people with minimal knowledge of the trucking industry envision drivers working. OTR routes can be regional with occasional outside of region assignments or they may be cross-country to make one delivery or several along the way. OTR drivers are generally paid by the mile and are on the road for much of the year with limited home time.Previous articleCDL-A Regional Truck Driver – Incredible Benefits & Home WeekendsNext articleStageline: Lease Purchase Opportunity – $0 downpayment – Make $180K or moreJob OverviewLease Purchase, Team DriverRefrigeratedOver the RoadNE$180,000Required endorsement:NoneRequired experience:Less than 6 months877-751-9145Apply for all jobs that fit my qualifications in ONE CLICK!Return to Jobs SearchFAQs on Job SearchWhy use TheTrucker.com for my truck driving job search?There are several reasons!
