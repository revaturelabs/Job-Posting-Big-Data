These can be both complex and cross-border. There are also plenty of opportunities to gain exposure to clients from a variety of sectors and backgrounds including major public sector bodies and FTSE 100 companies. The very nature of the work often lends itself to solicitors working closely with other departments within the firm for example Projects and Engineering, Commercial Litigation and Commercial Property.Transform your career in Construction & Engineering LawThe Construction legal market in itself is quite diverse with some firms having entirely separate non-contentious and contentious divisions whereas other departments incorporate a range of solicitors handling their own mixed caseloads.Construction typically confines itself to the commercial law firms similar to areas such as Banking and Projects (also referred to as Infrastructure Projects and Energy or PFI/PPP) and can often be perceived as a niche area. However, the opportunities for construction solicitors are plentiful both within Private Practice as well as In-House.In summary, a career in construction offers an array of opportunities both non-contentious and contentious. Furthermore, with the upturn in the economy and property market generally we have seen this market expand across our client base with smaller, niche practices offering such services to their clients after significant demand. This understandably has an impact on the overall requirement for solicitors who specialise within this area and this is likely to continue to grow across an array of firms from international practices to boutique, commercial firms. Accordingly, if you would like to speak to one of our consultants then call us today to have a discussion in confidence with one of our specialist legal recruitment consultants.View full list of practice areas Jobs in this areaLatest Construction & Engineering Lawyer JobsView all JobsContact one of our ConsultantsSimply talk to one of our highly experienced Consultants about your requirements and we will get to work transforming your career.Contact a ConsultantDiscoverAbout UsJoin UsJob SearchContact UsSubmit CVRegister A VacancyRefer A FriendDivisionsPartners and DirectorsAssociates and SolicitorsPatent and Trade MarkChartered Legal ExecutivesParalegalsInterimIn-HouseDont MissCandidatesClientsInsightsAreas of PracticeCase StudiesContact usYorkshire and North East 0113 245 3338Manchester and North West 0161 831 6890Midlands 0845 241 5644London 0845 241 5644We use cookies to enhance your experience on our website.
