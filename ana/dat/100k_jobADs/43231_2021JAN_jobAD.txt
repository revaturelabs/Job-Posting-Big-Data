When a user sends a print job to the server, the job prints but stays in the queue. Eventually the queue gets VERY full and will not accept any more printjobs. I have 3 other HP4000's on the network and none of the others have this problem. I have been unable to find a resolution on HP or Microsoft's website. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.Share FlagThis conversation is currently closed to new comments.+ Follow this Discussion ·+ Follow this Discussion ·Thread display: Collapse - | Expand +All CommentsCollapse -Print jobs stay in queueby mcorr · 19 years ago In reply to Print jobs stay in queueThis is a duplicate question.
