Demand for design engineers, application engineers, project engineers and sales managers is inevitable as heat pump manufacturers align themselves to compete for a slice of the market.The advantage heat pumps have over other green technologies is that they are already well established and recognised as an effective route to decarbonisation. This means they can help the UK move quickly in the shift to green energy.The HPA is campaigning for a level playing field across heating types to establish best practice and low carbon targets for all installations. It has published three key recommendations as the industry prepares for significant growth and investment:– Introduce a maximum flow temperature of 55℃ in Building Regulations to be applied to replacement heating systems from 2026.– Introduce in Building Regulations for Heat Loss Calculations to be carried out for all replacement heating systems from 2026.– All heating installers to have a Low Temperature Heating and Hot Water Qualification, or equivalent, as part of accreditation scheme refresher courses.Thornhvac has been a specialist recruiter in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning sectors for more than 20 years and is well placed to support heat pump businesses as they look to upskill to meet demand. We are also a primary port of call for talented engineers who are looking for their next career move.To find out more about how we can help you maximise the opportunities ahead call us on 01158714777​Share this articleRecent articlesWhat is the average salary for an HVAC sales manager?6 days ago by Jason Thornhill​5 ways to structure a CV that will get you noticedabout 1 month ago by Jason ThornhillGreen Plan Sparks Heat Pump Jobs Boomabout 2 months ago by Jason ThornhillRemote Working Recruitment Opportunitiesabout 2 months ago by Jason ThornhillPreparing for an HVAC job interview by video2 months ago by Jason ThornhillPromising Green Shoots in HVAC Jobs Market5 months ago by Jason ThornhillPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicySitemapCopyright © 2017 Thornhvac.
