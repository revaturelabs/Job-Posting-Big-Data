Todd Arnedt, PhD/PsychiatryDescriptionPOSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS IN ADULT CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY: The Michigan Medicine/VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System (MICHMED/VAAAHS) Clinical Psychology Consortium is accepting applications for fellowships in our APA-accredited training program. The program follows the scientist-practitioner model and emphasizes the training and development of psychologists in a rich interdisciplinary environment who will be able to assume leadership roles in research, teaching, and clinical service. Postdoctoral fellows participate in a core curriculum, evidence-based clinical training, and mentored clinical research in a specific content area. Research opportunities are available from a range of areas including mood disorders; women’s mental health; sleep and circadian science; health psychology; anxiety and related disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder); substance use disorders; psychotic disorders; bipolar disorder; primary care mental health integrations; and mental health recovery. We anticipate accepting four fellows into the consortium beginning September 2021: 1 MICHMED adult fellows, 2 VAAAHS adult fellows, and 1 VAAAHS adult women’s mental health fellow. Fellowships are APA-accredited for one year, but the MICHMED fellowship is two years in duration. Applications are encouraged from candidates with interests in any of the above research areas, but the MICHMED position is particularly interested in applicants with research interests in sleep and circadian science.Stipends currently range from $50,673 to $53,412 for 1st and 2nd year fellows, respectively. Benefits include vacations, sick leave and options for health insurance. As a consortium that places a high value on diversity, we welcome all applicants to apply, and would especially encourage applicants from underrepresented groups. Michigan Medicine and the VA Ann Arbor are committed to equal opportunity for all persons and do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, religion, height, weight, or veteran status.For up-to-date information and application materials, see the Consortium Web Page (https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/education/psychology-postdoctoral-training/specialty-areas/clinical-psychology-consortium). Deadline for applications is December 1, 2020. For further information about opportunities in the consortium, contact J. Todd Arnedt, Ph.D., MICHMED Training Program Director ([email protected]) or Beau Nelson, Ph.D. VAAAHS Training Program Director ([email protected]).
