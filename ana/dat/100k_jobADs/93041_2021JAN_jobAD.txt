You want to make a great first impression at the interview and you have painstakingly planned what to wear. Problem is, mother nature didn’t get the memo that your perfect job interview outfit did not take into consideration a rainy day.So what do you do?Well, you still want to show up dressed for a job interview, looking sharp and ready for success. Even though the interviewers may not remember what you are wearing, they should remember that your appearance was polished and professional. In the job interview, you will be evaluated on what you are wearing as much as what you are saying.Here is a quick “job interview clothes” guide for a rainy day:Clothes – The default job interview dress code is conservative or business attire. Wear a pant suit or dress pants on a rainy day. You will protect your legs from getting wet and it won’t be as noticeable. Stick to darker neutral colors like navy and black because you will still look sharp even if you get a little wet. I usually recommend a dress shirt or blouse in white or a light pastel color like pink, blue and green. But for a rainy day, I recommend staying away from white because you will end up with a see-through shirt if you do get soaked.Shoes – You should never wear open shoes or sandals to an interview and a rainy day is no exception. Wear conservative pumps and make sure you select a pair of heels that isn’t too high since you will be navigating through wet and slippery terrain. Trust me, there will be puddles everywhere and your goal will be to do everything possible not to trip and fall in the parking lot, at the entrance of the building or in the lobby.Accessories – If it’s raining, your best accessories will be a nice umbrella and matching raincoat. It’s hard to look professional when you are holding a multicolored umbrella with polka dots and wearing a bright red raincoat. Stick to dark neutral colors like black and navy to match your job interview outfit.Hair – Your job interview hairstyle is the first to go on a rainy day and the hardest to put back together when you have left the house. Pick a simple hairstyle that is easy to fix in the event that it’s also a windy day. It can make or break your entire look. Again, you want it to be polished, not messy and out of place when you arrive. Choose to pull your hair back in a ponytail instead letting it hang loose if you can.Purse – You’ll have plenty to hold already with an umbrella and raincoat in your hands so keep your purse or handbag small. Stick to a leather bag or briefcase since it wipes dry easily and carries off a professional look regardless of the weather.Your attire for job interviews even on a rainy day only needs a couple of adjustments to work. Sounds pretty simple right?[ad_2]Source by Adwoa Jonesjob interviewjob interview attirejob interview questions and answersjob interview questions to askjob interview tipsGeneral Interview Q&ARelated PostsKSI & Anne-Marie Answer Awkward Questions | Interview | CapitalWELT INTERVIEW: Alexander Maksimow – \"FFP2-Masken sind nicht alltagsfähig\"Interview Samuel Ghebreslasie , Part 2 ዕላል ምስ ስነጥበበኛ ሳሚኤል ገብረስላሴ ኣብ [Bella Media] 2021The Boy Abunda Interview Specials: \"Who Killed Christine Dacera?\" Part 2🤣 கல்யாணத்துக்கு மாப்பிள்ளை வருவாரான்னு ஒரு Doubt-லயே இருந்தாங்க -Rahul & Lakshmi Romantic InterviewPost navigationPREVIOUS POST Previous post: Four Tips on How to \"Behave\" on Your Job InterviewNEXT POST Next post: 8 Most Common Interview Questions – With 8 Best AnswersSpinterview.com © 2021 - Designed By BfastMag Powered by WordPressSubscribe Nowto get this amazing Fiverr EBOOK FREEName*Email*Please accept terms & conditionBy subscribing to this newsletter you agree to our Privacy PolicySkip to contentOpen toolbarAccessibility ToolsIncrease Text	Decrease Text	Grayscale	High Contrast	Negative Contrast	Light Background	Links Underline	Readable Font	Reset"
