If not, then how does it make sense that Republican candidates who insist government can never create jobs all run campaign ads claiming they alone have a secret plan to create jobs? Are we as an electorate that stupid? Are we completely blind to contradictions? We will soon know.Share QuestionFlag as...politicsrepublicansjobslogicadvertisingcontradictionsObserving members: 0 Composing members: 09 AnswersThey aren’t claiming to create jobs. They are saying they want to get government out of the way by spending less and letting the free market create jobs. With unemployment higher today than it was just one month ago, out “summer of recovery” through billions in spending doesn’t seem to have worked.missingbite (7531 )“Great Answer” (3 ) Flag as… ¶Huh?

That is exactly how Obama got himself elected.

But ever Republican ad running claaims that the candidate running the ad will create jobs. And as to past performance, I remember when we were losing jobs at over 700,000 a month the last time the miracle principles of government doing nothing but cutting taxes for the rich and cutting regulation were in practice for 8 years. That’s how we got in this mess.@YARNLADY I can follow that. Unfortunately, we are going to either have to pull the lever for a R or D or toss a vote into the wind voting for a party with no chance of winning.ETpro (34550 )“Great Answer” (1 ) Flag as… ¶Response moderated (Spam)It’s true tht corporate money has corrupted both parties to some degree, but the GOP has always been the party of the wealthiest Americans and the corporate jet set. They hammer culture-war issues to win enough dupes among the common people to be able to serve their rich masters. But they work directly against middle-class and poor American’s interests. The Democratic Party has mostly defended the interests of the ordinary man.The Republians who adamantly claim that government can’t create jobs, and that Obama’s a jerk for not creating more, and that they will do far better are now in control of the House of Representatives. So far, all they have proposed is moves that will cause massive layoffs.ETpro (34550 )“Great Answer” (1 ) Flag as… ¶Answer this questionLoginorJointo answer.Oops.
