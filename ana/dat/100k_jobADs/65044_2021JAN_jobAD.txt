This follows on the heels of yesterday’s announcement by Siemens and Samsung to build a wind turbine blade manufacturing plant in Ontario that will create up to 900 direct and indirect jobs. Less than one year after the launch of Ontario’s landmark Green Energy Act, several other companies have announced plans to set up or expand solar and wind turbine manufacturing facilities in Ontario.Companies that want to secure clean energy Feed-in Tariff (FIT) contracts must use Ontario products and services for a specific percentage of their project. The 694 clean energy contracts already announced are expected to create approximately 20,000 direct and indirect green economy jobs over five years and about $9 billion in private sector investment. These projects will generate enough electricity each year to power 600,000 homes.Ontario’s new clean energy economy is creating jobs in construction, installation, operations and maintenance, engineering, manufacturing, finance, IT and software.
