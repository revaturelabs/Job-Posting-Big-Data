Basically, most of the jobs that can be done by a programming interface (API) will end up being done by an automated process. He lists Uber and 99designs as examples of APIs directing people to perform tasks and how these jobs will eventually all be done by robots (ie autonomous vehicles, software-generated designs, etc).So, jobs above the API will be safe while jobs below the API will get increasingly smaller. I think his examples and reasonings are sound and I think the term \"white-collar\" may eventually be replaced with a term like \"above the API\" or some variation of it. And who are the people above the APIs? The software engineers, of course.Either way you look at it, software engineering/computer programming is the definitive \"Above the API\" job of the future.Tags: Futurecasting , Technologyfacebooktwittergoogle+MickeyNo comments:Post a CommentNewer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)Bottom Ad [Post Page]Powered by Blogger.Search This BlogRecentPopularWhy I switched from Squarespace to BloggerAs some of you can tell, my website changed and that's because I migrated from Squarespace to Blogger.
