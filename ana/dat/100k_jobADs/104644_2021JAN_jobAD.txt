Certainly. It could be. But now they are big shoes to fill, eh.”On who should actually replace Ronald Koeman, he added, “Who should succeed him? That is very difficult now. Koeman has proven that he was the right man for the Dutch national team. Yes, I think KNVB is now in a bag.”Louis van Gaal would be a good choice according to the 74-time Oranje international, “I think so. If he wanted to and everyone agrees, why not? He did well at the World Cup.”Edgar Davids steekt zijn ambities niet onder stoelen of banken. De voormalig Oranje-international wil bondscoach worden: ’Maar het zijn nu grote schoenen om te vullen, hè.’ https://t.co/3R2bE5uRkG— Telesport Voetbal (@televoetbal) August 19, 2020Followadmin (9864 Posts)Follow @Footballoranje_ on TwitterShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...RelatedTags: Edgar Davids, netherlands, Oranje, Ronald KoemanLeave a ReplyClick here to cancel reply.Name (required)E-Mail (required)Website (Optional)« Van der Vaart wants Cocu as new Netherlands bossAjax’s Champions League spot confirmed »Dutch Football News 24/7Follow our new Twitter accountMy TweetsFootball-Oranje is on YoutubeTop Posts & PagesAjax linked with Crystal Palace talent	Ajax hoping to bring Sanchez back from Tottenham	Fortuna Sittard set to sign Stoke City winger	Newcastle United interested in PSV left-back	Ten Hag a candidate for Borussia Mönchengladbach	Eredivisie Predictions & Betting 20/21: Round 18	Johnston to leave Feyenoord for Wigan Athletic	Manchester United not interested in loaning out Van de Beek	De Jong handed Barcelona rest	Eredivisie Predictions & Betting 20/21: Round 17	Privacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
