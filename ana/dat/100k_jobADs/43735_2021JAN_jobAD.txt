This is significant particularly when the candidate faces the famous question of ‘explain yourself’. During such instances, elevator pitches help the candidate gain confidence in introducing him to company representatives.For not missing the decisive opportunity, here are some tips on preparing an ideal elevator pitch.Tips to follow while preparing the ideal elevator pitchNoting down points on a paper strip:The candidate is best advised to write the plans down on a piece of paper to find out the relevant matter to be included and those to be excluded. Editing must be done carefully. Unnecessary data must be removed and focus must be on presenting oneself professionally and effectively for those that have very little time.A Solution for All Questions:The pitch prepared by the candidate should simply mention who he is, what he does and what he was looking for. All such questions must be answered by a good elevator pitch..A Professional Tone is Ideal:For presenting the candidate’s best self to the recruiter in front, the achievements and goals comprised in the pitch by the candidate must talk about themselves. Bragging could prove to be negative as regards to effect on the listener. But hesitation or lengthy talking for getting to the point must also be avoided as such moves could spoil the pitch’s purpose.Should be Listener Friendly: The person supposed to be listening to the elevator pitch of a candidate would be generally thinking, what the pitch carried for him. Therefore, the candidate preparing the pitch should ensure that the pitch sounded he would be a massive asset to the listener’s organization.To quote Saint BasilFirst and foremost, the monk should own nothing in this world, but he should have as his possessions solitude of the body, modesty of bearing, a modulated tone of voice, and a well-ordered manner of speech. He should be without anxiety as to his food and drink, and should eat in silenceSpeaking Too Fast:There definitely is the dilemma of presenting all his achievements, in short sentences for the candidate. Still, the candidate is advised not to cram information worth a minute or two into a thirty-second slot. Here speaking coherently in full sentences is a wise thing.Being Robotic: The candidate needs to understand that frowning and using monotone are hardly part of being professional. A smile and being sincere are welcome additions always.Post Views: 17leave your commentCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
