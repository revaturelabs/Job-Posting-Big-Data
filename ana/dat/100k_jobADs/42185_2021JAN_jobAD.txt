However, for every one good piece of advice you’ll hear, there are ten myths that simply won’t help you. To help you weed out these myths, we’re going over a few common misconceptions or outright lies people believe when it comes to job hunting.Here are the top job hunting myths you need to unlearn, and quickly.Focus on What Pays the MostWhen you’re getting ready to choose a career path, many people will tell you to focus on the ones that pay the most. Lawyer, doctor, programmer, and so forth. These jobs are great for some people. However, if you have no passion for them, you shouldn’t pursue them. Hopping into a career just because it pays well is a recipe for a miserable life.Instead, follow your heart. What are you passionate about? Find a career in a field that you love. If you chase what you love, not what makes the most money, you’ll likely lead a happier and healthier life.Focus on Only One Career PathEven well-meaning advice can steer you the wrong way. Some old wisdom would have you believe that you need to pick one career path and stick with it in order to succeed. However, there’s no shame in changing course. If you’ve decided on a career path, but then realize that it’s not for you, that’s okay!When you tell teenagers that they need to pick the career that will define the rest of their adult lives, you’re putting the wrong expectations on them. No sixteen-year-old even knows what they want for breakfast tomorrow, let alone what career they want to focus on. It’s okay to change track and jump into a career path that better suits your current interests.Only Shoot for the StarsThis is a big one, and it’s tripped up a lot of people. There’s an overwhelming pull to shoot for the stars, especially in American career coaching. When you walk into a job interview, you need to understand that you’re unlikely to become the CEO. You’re unlikely to ever become an executive, for that matter.Having realistic expectations for your career is a good thing. It’s healthy, even! When you have a better grasp on where you stand with regards to your opportunities, you can begin thinking in a more concrete manner about your career. It’s okay to be realistic!Continue Reading:Why do Employees Quit?
