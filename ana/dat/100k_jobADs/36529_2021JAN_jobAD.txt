Think smart with these interview preparation tipsWritten byChangeboard TeamPublished24 Aug 2016ShareSendFacebookTwitterLinkedIn24 Aug 2016 • by Changeboard TeamThese crucial job interview tips will help you focus on what's really important when the big day arrives.How do you prepare for job interviews?Many candidates preparing for their interviews have so much potential, but they have ‘floundered’ in their own preparation, not knowing where to start. Reviewing your whole career and looking at what is appropriate for a new role is a vast subject, so it’s no surprise some people get lost.Study the job description with careMost people at this stage of the process should have a full job description (JD). This document is worth its weight in gold. This is where you need to start.You'll want a job description from the employer, but you can also prepare by exploring sample job descriptions, like those we host on Changeboard to support job applicants from entry to senior level.Match your skills and competencies to the job description using the CAR modelYou need to make sure that you have examples that demonstrate that you match as many of the skills and competencies articulated in the JD as you can. Read through the JD and think through your experience and see what matches.Once you have thought about the examples, write them down. Write them in a structure following the CAR model.Context: One sentence to explain the reason you were involved in this scenario.Action: What actions did YOU take to address and resolve the issue?Result: What was the outcome and benefit of your actions? This model will give you structure that will pay huge dividends in the interview.Consolidate your examples into nice succinct stories that clearly articulate the CAR examples. Then practice them verbally. This is critical for you to get used to the flow and structure of the examples.Classic interview questions to prepare forAs well as the potential competency questions for which you have just prepared, you may also get some classic questions.Please take me through your CV/career - This is a classic opening request and you need to be ready for it. Skim through the early years and spend most of the 3 or 4 minutes highlighting your recent experience that makes you relevant for the job. Bring them fully up to date by finishing on why you are now looking for this new roleWhat are your strengths - Make sure you know them and can give examplesWhat are your weaknesses - Prepare by choosing a skill that’s not relevant for the new role and explain how you have learnt how to do it, so that it is now something the employer doesn’t have to worry aboutWhat would you like to be doing in 5 years’ time - Ambition can be about further contribution and learning in your role and doesn’t have to be about hierarchical climbingWhy do you want to work for us - Do your research and see where the company is moving to, so that you can discuss reasons that are relevant for their future successWhat is your greatest achievement?: Answer with pride in the CAR format.Job interview top tip - prepare for the obvious and expect the unexpectedYou can never cover off every possible question, so prepare for the obvious and if done properly you will be able to answer at least 80% of the questions. That should give you huge confidence.Always expect a few questions that you have not prepared for. When they come, don’t panic. Just use your brain to answer them logically, concisely and with relevance- remember CAR!.Logistics preparation for job interviewsOf course you have to do the logistics preparation around time and location etc, so do that and if possible do ask your contact what type of interview it is likely to be and how many people will be on the panel etc. This knowledge will give you confidence that you know what to expect and there will be few surprises.What questions should you ask at the end of a job interview?Finally, people get hung up on what questions the candidate should ask at the end.If you are genuinely interested in the role and the company, you will have some very natural questions to ask to satisfy your inquisitiveness. Go with these, or respond to points raised in the interview.Keep the questions few, original and punchy.Tips to focus your job interview preparationSo in summary your preparation should focus on the priorities:Know your own background and break it down into relevant examplesUse the CAR model to structure your examplesConsider common interview questions and how you would answer themRun through the logistics so that you are comfortable on the dayThink about what you really want to ask the companyThe bottom line is that you must practice your answers out loud. Use a friend or career coach to help you fine tune these, ensuring you will go to the interview having prepared the right things smartly and effectively. It is mainly this which will win you the job.By Changeboard TeamPublished: 24 Aug 2016ShareSendFacebookTwitterLinkedInArticles you might likePerspective: Want to reach your full potential?
