He retired after the 2016 season as one of the most decorated and best-loved players in Red Sox history. Of course, if you know anything about Big Papi, you know the man isn’t about to rest on his laurels. He’s already going out of his mind—and he’s driving his family nuts too! They all agree on one thing—this man was not built for a retirement made up of “puttering” around the house. He needs to find himself some gainful employment—and fast! Watch Big Papi as he seeks out new jobs and opportunities with hilarious and surprising results.Duration10 x 30'Episode TitlesDog Groomer/Fenway Tour Guide Musician/Manicurist Food Truck Cook/BarberZookeeper/Barista Firefighter Trainee/Sous Chef Brewmaster/Coach/MechanicCigar Roller/Lobster Fisherman Bomb Squad Technical/Bartender Horse Handicapper/TrainerSommelier/Salsa DancerEpisodic BreakdownProduction CompanyMatador for Fusion TVBroadcasterFusion Network MediaDefinitionHDYOP2018Production CompanyMatador for Fusion TVBroadcasterFusion Network MediaDefinitionHDYOP2018More Like ThisPlatinum Weddings (Series 3)26 x 30'Beyond The Pole (Series 1)7 x 60'Mary Mary (Series 5)10 x 60'ArtStar (Series 2)12 x 30'Email Programme CardPlease enter your email below and we will send you all the programmes details.SendContact Usinfo@offthefence.comSalesHerengracht 105 -107, Amsterdam 1015BETel: +31 2052 00222AcquisitionsSuite 634, Southside, 105 Victoria Street, London, SW1E 6QT, UKTel: +44 020 3457 2978Website Designed & Powered by OTV Systems Privacy Policy"
