If you will not see it within 24 hours go to wp-admin / Dashboard / Updates panel and click the “Check Again” button it should show then.New WPJobBoard introduces one new, big feature, and a few minor changes and updates.Application StatusesThe biggest change in new WPJobBoard is a new editor that allows managing application statuses. You should be able to find it in wp-admin/ Settings (WPJB) / Application Statuses panel.By default, you will see there all default statuses (New, Read, Accepted, Rejected) and you can adjust their name, e-mail template (sent when application changes status), and color of the “bulb”. Each status can have assigned e-mail template that will be sent to notify the user when his application status will be changed to this status.New E-mail Templates you can create in wp-admin / Settings (WPJB)/ Emails / Add New panel. To be able to choose your new template, it should be a child template of “notify_applicant_status_change”.If you already have some applications, please be sure to match correct IDs.LinkedInOn the 1st of March 2019, LinkedIn will remove completely old API. This means, that your old LinkedIn integrations will stop working.New WPJobBoard is prepared for this. After upgrading to the latest version you will need to go to the LinkedIn Developers page click “Create App” button, create the application again and then configure whole integration like you previously did.Unfortunately, LinkedIn allows only to share posts now. The feature “Apply with LinkedIn” is reserved for LinkedIn partners. We will try to do something to include this feature in future releases. More details available in our documentation.Candidate Payment HistoryThe candidates can now their payments history from the [wpjb_candidate_panel] / Payments page, similarly as the Employers can from the page with [wpjb_employer_panel] shortcode.Other EnchantmentsXing Integration – Now, you are able to provide your job feed to Xing. URL to the feed is available in wp-admin / Settings (WPJB) / Aggregators and RSS Feeds panel.Resume Category – Click on a category link on resume list will redirect to list of resumes in this category.Variables in registration e-mail – You can now add {$resume} and {$company} variables into registration e-mails templates.Filled Jobs Tab – In Employer jobs list, you have a new tab – filled, when you can find all filled jobs.
