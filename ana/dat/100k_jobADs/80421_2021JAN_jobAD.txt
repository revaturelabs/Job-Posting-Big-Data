Malmö Theatre Academy aspires to be a leading educational and research department in the field of theatre as well as a relevant and open platform in Malmö. We offer particularlypromising and motivated students and researchers a clearly profiled and international environment that prepares them for a challenging and changing profession.Malmö Theatre Academy is now recruiting a doctoral student in artistic research in theatre with a specialization in new forms of documentary theatre.Artistic research at Malmö Theatre AcademyArtistic research is academic research based on the artistic skill and experience of its practitioner. Conducting artistic research implies creative use and critical assessment of one’s artistic medium for approaching topical problem areas within or outside the arts field. The outcomes change our knowledge and understanding regarding those areas and, thereby, contribute to the overall development of arts, research and society.On the future of documentary theatreThis call in the field of performing arts focuses on the study of the inter- and transmedial potentials of contemporary documentary theatre. In times of increasing globalization, digitalization and mobility, traditional cultural hierarchies and forms of production have been challenged by new technologies, e.g. interactive ones, not least in the media field. This has resulted in new patterns of cultural consumption and participation. The performing arts, based traditionally on the physical encounter between performers and audience, will need to develop strategies to relate creatively and critically to this paradigm shift. This call is addressed to artist-researchers working in the field of documentary theatre, who are interested in and capable of studying the ways how the new technology can be used for– expanding, diversifying and transforming the artistic possibilities of documentary theatre,– increasing its accessibility and the diversity of its audience,– opening critical perspectives on our presumably “common” reality, and– providing new models and devices for education.Through this call, Malmö Theatre Academy addresses the problem concerning the impact of the fast-changing media landscape on the 21st-century theatre and its audiences. The call continues the Academy’s traditions in the field of study of inter- and transmedial theatre-making.The participation of the doctoral students in the department’s breadth of activities is an essential part of the studies. In practice, this means that the doctoral students are to take part in the Academy’s meetings and actively contribute to the bilateral development between research and education on the basis of their personal input. Besides their research studies, doctoral students are supposed to a limited extent to partake in teaching, developmental tasks and administration pursuant to Chapter 5 Section 2 of the Higher Education Ordinance (1993:100). This type of work requires regular attendance at the academy and presumes in principle that the doctoral students live within commuting distance of the academy.QualificationsOnly those admitted to a third cycle study programme may be employed as doctoral students. A person is qualified for a third cycle study programme in the arts if theyhave completed a Master’s degree,meet the course requirements of at least 240 credits within theatre study programmes or comparable study programmes, of which at least 60 credits obtained in the second cycle orhave acquired essentially equivalent knowledge in some other way, within the country or abroad.The specific entry requirements for artistic research studies are met by those whohave submitted a plan and purpose for an intended project and had it assessed and approved by the admissions board,have conducted independent work of such a nature as to enable the assessment of the applicant’s suitability for the study programme,have artistic expertise in relation to the main area of study, theatre, or other relevant link to artistic activity within the field, andare assessed as possessing other abilities required to successfully complete the programme.Grounds for assessmentIn connection with their application, applicants are to present their intended research project in a research plan.

The grounds for selection among the candidates are the applicant’s qualifications at the time of application.
