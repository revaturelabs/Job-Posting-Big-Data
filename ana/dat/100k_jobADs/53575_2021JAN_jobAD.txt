People used to print any documents using typewriters. At that time jobs for Data Entry were too much famous. People who had a high typing speed were doing jobs in Data Entry with Type Writer.Now-a-days Computer System is too much developed. But before Computer and after Typewriter data entry were being performed by, Modem data entry, Punched card data entry, After so many searches a first computer were developed it was too bulky in size. To making data entry jobs in earlier computer system were too much time consuming process. But after evaluation in IT fields now we can take computer anywhere in the world without any physical connections. Now-a-days in market requirements for Data-Entry jobs is increasing day-by-days. There are so many opportunity for job seekers for Data-Entry jobs.

Type of job.Let us take a hypothetical example of one site say xyz.com and I am not sure if it is reputed or not.Now I am paid for typing ads about this site on various pages on internet.Now there is second site called abc.com where I am paid for some data they have in existing pdf files which they want to put online in HTML form.I guess tasks which you think are good and genuine should be done else you can safely forget it.shabbir, Jul 12, 2010SHARE #9shabbir Administrator Staff MemberJoined:Jul 12, 2004Messages:15,334Likes Received:377Trophy Points:83Also would suggest you read my article on this hereshabbir, Jul 12, 2010SHARE #10hardik soni New MemberJoined:Jun 26, 2010Messages:73Likes Received:1Trophy Points:0Occupation:Writer, SEOLocation:Rajkot,IndiaHey Shabbir,Thanks your article ,\"Helping Online Entrepreneurs\" is too much informative.can u give me this kind of more information if you have.Thanks.hardik soni, Jul 12, 2010SHARE #11shabbir Administrator Staff MemberJoined:Jul 12, 2004Messages:15,334Likes Received:377Trophy Points:83The blog is all for you to read and don't forget to subscribe to the course.shabbir, Jul 12, 2010SHARE #12hardik soni New MemberJoined:Jun 26, 2010Messages:73Likes Received:1Trophy Points:0Occupation:Writer, SEOLocation:Rajkot,IndiaHey Shabbir,They all are very interesting as well as informative thanks for sharing it.Thanks.hardik soni, Jul 12, 2010SHARE #13(You must log in or sign up to reply here.)Show Ignored ContentShare This PageTweetLog in with FacebookYour name or email address:Do you already have an account?No, create an account now.Yes, my password is:Forgot your password?Stay logged inSign up now!Members Online NowDiantaelTotal: 117 (members: 1, guests: 97, robots: 19)New Profile PostsRichard Tohttps://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-to-6a93707b/Jan 4, 2021•••NanDigital Marketing ExecutiveNov 24, 2020•••Viktoria ► shabbirHello!
