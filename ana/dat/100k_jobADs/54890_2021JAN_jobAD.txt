Most interviews will take 30 minutes or less, giving you a short amount of time to leave a lasting impression. But fortunately, there are a few tips that can get you one step closer to landing the job.The first step in mastering a phone interview is to invest time in preparation. Create a small space where the interview will be conducted, and lay out your resume and a list of your most impressive accomplishments. And just because you're not meeting in person doesn't mean you can wear sweats and a t-shirt. Dress up, it will help you feel more put together.Also, keep pets and other distractions out of the room. The goal is to give the hospital job recruiter the most professional impression possible. Barking dogs, background noises from TV, or a laundry machine going haywire will provide a huge distraction.And finally, avoid little pitfalls that can give an unfavorable impression. For example, don't interrupt the interviewer, provide direct answers and don't forget to close the deal for an in-person interview.CommentsNobody has commented on this tip yet.
