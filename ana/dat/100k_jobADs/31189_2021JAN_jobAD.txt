Queensland is faced with immense challenges as we transition to a low carbon world, but those challenges also provide extraordinary opportunities.\"The Queensland Mayor Projects Pipeline 2020 report shows significant projects such as Inland Rail, Gold Coast Light Rail Stage 3, Cross River Rail, Brisbane Metro and upgrades to the M1, Bruce Highway and essential water infrastructure developments are all underway or close to starting, but private investment is badly lagging and with it the 6600 extra construction jobs riding on the megaprojects getting off the drawing board.The report says there are 222 projects worth at least $50M each across the state, totalling $50.6B in the pipeline from 2019-20 to 2023-24.Of that, $27.4B is funded and ready to go but another $23.2B sit waiting for funding..More StoriesPremium Content $50b projects, 6.6k jobs at risk — and not from virusPremium Content New safety authority to 'champion' for QLD minersPremium Content Qld man who flew to NZ with COVID-19 ‘no risk’ to publicPremium Content Home office tech is ‘the new loo paper’More StoriesPremium Content $50b projects, 6.6k jobs at risk — and not from virusPremium Content New safety authority to 'champion' for QLD minersPremium Content Qld man who flew to NZ with COVID-19 ‘no risk’ to publicPremium Content Home office tech is ‘the new loo paper’01employmentRead MoreLogin to followminingRead MoreLogin to followpoliticsRead MoreLogin to followqueenslandRead MoreLogin to followemployment mining politics queenslandTop StoriesPremium Content BREAKING: Man hospitalised after car smashes into tree in...News Emergency services are on the scene of a traffic crash in the Maranoa, after a vehicle has smashed into a tree.
