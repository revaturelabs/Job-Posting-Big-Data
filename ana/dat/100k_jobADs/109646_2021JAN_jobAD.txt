If you want to thrive in an upcoming field, then the chances of you missing a good opportunity due to your applications going unnoticed are high. We receive countless resumes every day at TheDataTeam(TDT) And we’ve seen it all—the good and the not-so-good. Therefore our recruiters decided to make this process less daunting for you.Do you want to know what makes us notice a resume?Here’s one example: Scanning through new applications for an entry-level marketing role, we came across an interesting file that read: “OPEN ME.” Of course, our curiosity got the best of us, and we opened the elaborate, flashy, fun PowerPoint presentation containing the candidate’s information and work history. If you are a data scientist, you can write “Yourname_for_TheDataTeam”. Be creative but don’t miss the point.By putting in the extra effort to make the resume stand out, the candidate quickly gets attention—and the interview. And we happily route the resume to the hiring manager. Here are some tips which will help you get noticed by the TheDataTeam recruiters.1. Don’t shoot out generic resumes. Personalize it for the Job DescriptionWe receive thousands of resumes per job posting and we always appreciate a candidate who has spent time in not only understanding what we do but also in helping us navigate through his resume by mentioning the skills and experiences which are relevant. Here is a simple tip to get this rightOnly mention relevant skills on the first page of your resume along with a competency scale. Rate your skills on a scale of 1 to 5. 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest proficiency.2. Add bullet points to highlight relevant skills at the topWe have noticed that every resume has a very ineffective objective at the top. At TDT we take pride in cutting out noneffective formalities to build efficiency at everything we do. So cut out the generic objective and instead use that space toAdd 5 most important skills that you have which are relevant to the job you are applying for at the top competency rating as mentioned in the above point.Top 3 achievements in your earlier work experiences. Please keep these relevant to the role you have applied for. Remember no irrelevant descriptions or skills on page 1!3. Only include detailed work experience(More than 3 lines) of relevant jobs you have done in the pastCandidates believe if they provide more description of their experiences it increases their chance of getting noticed. This is a myth. Honestly, at the recruiter level, we want to know as fast as we can that you are good for THE role you are applying. A resume is not a place to impress a recruiter, it is a document to help recruiters choose you. Here are a few tips on how you can help us choose you.Mention your latest and relevant work experience first. Start from the latest one and end it with the oldest one while covering your work experience.Keep the descriptions short. We would go beyond it and say write crisp bullet points and avoid cluttering resumes with unnecessary jargons.Do not over-describe nonrelevant work experiences.4. Add hyperlinks to your resumeHyperlinks save space on the resume and still provide the recruiter a chance to know you in-depth. The hiring manager definitely likes to know more about you. Here are some tips-Keep your LinkedIn updated and then include a link. No one wants to see a LinkedIn account that’s old and dead for ages.Provide links of your work if it is unavailable online like GitHub or Quora or any other platform.Provide website links of your earlier companies instead of writing long descriptions of companies you worked for.5. Review, Reformat and proofreadThis is old news, but we still receive ill-formatted resumes. This creates a poor first impression. Formatting and reviewing hardly take 15 min and we suggest spending that time before forwarding your resume. We recommend getting it reviewed from a third person who has an eye for detail.Review for spelling mistakes and grammar errors. English does not matter for your ability to work. This just shows that you put effort into what you do suggesting that you will put effort into your work as well.Send a pdf instead of sending word files. There are many free online word to pdf converters.Proofread, proofread, proofreadWe know that the current situation due to Covid-19 is causing job seekers’ anxiety and #WEAREINTHISTOGETHER. We are hiring and will continue to do so.Know how you can Grow your career with TheDataTeam and do work that makes a difference every day.
