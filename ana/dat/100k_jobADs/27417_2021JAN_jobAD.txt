The American Petroleum Institute and major oil and gas corporations are spending millions to convince Americans that with unrestricted access to natural resources, they can lift us from our economic slump in part by fracking our nation’s shale gas reserves. But Exposing the Oil and Gas Industry’s False Jobs Promise for Shale Gas Development, a new set of analyses released Nov. 15 by the national consumer advocacy organization Food & Water Watch, finds that the oil and gas industry is exaggerating the capacity of shale gas development to generate jobs and economic opportunity for Americans, in one case exaggerating projected job creation by 900 percent.“The oil and gas industry has tried to stand on three legs, claiming that shale gas is good for the environment, good for American energy security and good for the economy. The first two legs have already been kicked out, and our new analysis kicks out the third,” said Food & Water Watch Executive Director Wenonah Hauter. “They have no legs left to stand on.”A 2011 report by the Public Policy Institute of New York State (PPINYS) claimed that by 2018, developing 500 new shale gas wells each year in five counties in New York would create 62,620 jobs. Food & Water Watch closely examined the PPINYS report and found it riddled with flaws. In fact, the economic forecasting model that PPINYS used actually only supported a claim of 6,656 jobs. PPINYS inflated the job-creation potential of shale gas development by almost 900 percent. According to Food & Water Watch, even the corrected PPINYS jobs projection is overly optimistic because it fails to account for negative effects that shale gas development would have on other key parts of the economy, such as agriculture and tourism.Exposing the Oil and Gas Industry’s False Jobs Promise for Shale Gas Development examines employment data, revealing that opening up five counties in the southern tier of New York to shale gas development can be expected to generate a net gain in employment of only about 2 jobs per well. This calculation, derived from data on actual employment, is in stark contrast with the forecast of 125 jobs per well in the PPINYS report. According to Food & Water Watch, an employment gain of just 2 jobs per shale gas well does not justify the inevitable costs to public health, public infrastructure and the environment that the industry would bring to New York.Across the U.S., shale gas development has generated a barrage of costly consequences:To date, more than 1,000 cases of drinking water contamination have been reported near shale gas development sites around the U.S.In 2008, a fracking wastewater pit in Colorado leaked 1.6 million gallons of fluids, some of which contaminated the Colorado River.In Wise County, Texas, properties with fracking wells have lost 75 percent of their value.In 2009, Pennsylvania regulators ordered the Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation to cease all fracking in Dimock, Pa., after three spills at one well within a week polluted a wetland and endangered fish in a local creek. The spills leaked 8,420 gallons of fluids that contained potential carcinogens. The state fined the company $240,000, and it cost more than $10 million to deliver potable water to the affected homes. A legal battle has now ensued over who should be responsible for providing Dimock residents with clean water.Scientists have found that 25 percent of the hundreds of chemicals used in fracking can cause cancer, 37 percent can disrupt the endocrine system and 40 to 50 percent can affect the nervous, immune and cardiovascular systems.Fracking wells in Pennsylvania, a state with many active sites, are expected to create 19 million gallons of wastewater this year, yet many municipal treatment plants lack the capacity to treat fracking wastewater in part because it often contains radioactive elements.Many of the flaws in the PPINYS report come from a series of studies led by Timothy Considine of the University of Wyoming. His series of studies have informed many evaluations of the economic potential of shale gas development by policymakers, including the U.S. Department of Energy’s Shale Gas Subcommittee.The industry’s jobs projections are used to make the case for deregulation, but the oil and gas companies’ recent record tells a different story. According to a report released in September by Congressman Ed Markey (D-MA), ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips, all involved in shale gas development, paid their executives a total of nearly $220 million and recorded $73 billion in profits in 2010. However, the Big 5 oil companies reduced their global workforce by a combined 4,400 employees that same year.“While President Obama’s recent move to delay his decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline is a sign that his administration is attuned to public concern about the negative effects of tar sands, we hope he will not replace it with shale gas development,” said Hauter. “The oil and gas industry has exploited our economic woes to promote shale gas, yet actual employment data shows that it is not a cure-all for our nation’s economic challenges. The money to be made from shale gas development will mostly just benefit oil and gas executives.”Exposing the Oil and Gas Industry’s False Jobs Promise for Shale Gas Development is available here.For more information, click here.—————Food & Water Watch works to ensure the food, water and fish we consume is safe, accessible and sustainable. So we can all enjoy and trust in what we eat and drink, we help people take charge of where their food comes from, keep clean, affordable, public tap water flowing freely to our homes, protect the environmental quality of oceans, force government to do its job protecting citizens, and educate about the importance of keeping shared resources under public control.energybooks12 New Books Explore Fresh Approaches to Act on Climate ChangeYale Climate Connections23mClimateBy Michael Svoboda, Ph.D.Despite a journey to this moment even more treacherous than expected, Americans now have a fresh opportunity to act, decisively, on climate change.The authors of the many new books released in just the past few months (or scheduled to be published soon) seem to have anticipated this pivotal moment.<p>Their number includes a scientist, an entrepreneur, and a journalist, each of whom has published among the first calls to action on climate change: Michael Mann, Bill Gates, and Elizabeth Kolbert.</p><p>But all the authors recognize that our repeated failures to seize previous opportunities says something about our market economy, our mindsets, and our political institutions. Thus the solutions offered in these new titles are as often political as they are scientific and technical, and psychological as often as they are environmental.</p><p>Americans succeeded in making a critical change: a climate denier no longer presides over the United States. With the 12 titles listed below, Americans can now consider new possibilities – at all levels – made possible by that first change.</p><p>As always, the descriptions of the 12 titles listed below are adapted from copy provided by the publishers.</p><p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/michael-e-mann/the-new-climate-war/9781541758223/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The New Climate War: The Fight to Take Back Our Planet</a>, by Michael E.

But all is not lost. In his new book, Mann outlines a plan for forcing our governments and corporations to wake up and make real change, by allowing renewable energy to compete fairly against fossil fuels, by debunking the false narratives and arguments that have worked their way into the climate debate, and by combatting climate doomism. The societal tipping point necessary to win the new climate war won't happen without the active participation of citizens everywhere aiding in the collective push forward.</em></p><p><strong>2.<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/633968/how-to-avoid-a-climate-disaster-by-bill-gates/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need</a>, by Bill Gates (Penguin Random House 2021, 272 pages, $26.95)</strong></p><p><em>In this urgent, authoritative book, Bill Gates sets out a wide-ranging, practical – and accessible – plan for how the world can get to zero greenhouse gas emissions in time to avoid a climate catastrophe.

And yet we struggle to grasp the scale of the crisis, barely able to imagine the effects of climate change just ten years from now, let alone the multi-millennial timescales of Earth's life span. In this book, political economist Vincent Ialenti takes on two overlapping crises: the Anthropocene, our current moment of human-caused environmental transformation, and the deflation of expertise – today's popular mockery and institutional erosion of expert authority. The second crisis, he argues, is worsening the effects of the first. Hearing out scientific experts who study a wider time span than a Facebook timeline is key to tackling our planet's emergency. This is the kind of time literacy we need if we are to survive the Anthropocene.</em></p><p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/untold-story-worlds-leading-environmental-institution\" target=\"_blank\">The Untold Story of the World's Leading Environmental Institution: UNEP at Fifty</a>, by Maria Ivanova (The MIT Press 20201, 384 pages, $30.00 paperback)</strong></p><p><em>The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) was founded in 1972 as a nimble, fast, and flexible entity at the core of the UN system – a subsidiary body rather than a specialized agency. In this book, Maria Ivanova offers a detailed account of UNEP's origin and history and a vision for its future. Ivanova counters the common criticism that UNEP was deficient by design, arguing that UNEP has in fact delivered on much (though not all) of its mandate. UNEP's fiftieth anniversary, Ivanova argues, presents an opportunity for reinvention. She envisions a future UNEP that is the go-to institution for information on the state of the planet, a normative vision of global environmental governance, and support for domestic environmental agendas.</em></p><p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-Are-We-Going-to-Explain-This/Jelmer-Mommers/9781982163136\" target=\"_blank\">How Are We Going to Explain This?

Climate change. <a href=\"https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IFRC_wdr2020/IFRC_WDR_ExecutiveSummary_EN_Web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">More than 100 climate-related catastrophes</a> have pummeled the Earth since the pandemic was declared last spring, including the blitzkrieg of megafires, superstorms and heat waves witnessed during the summer of 2020, directly impacting the lives of more than <a href=\"https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IFRC_wdr2020/IFRC_WDR_ExecutiveSummary_EN_Web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">50 million people globally</a>.</p><p>Water and climate scientist Brad Udall often says, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQhpj5G0dME\" target=\"_blank\">Climate change is water change</a>.\" In other words, the most obvious and dire impacts of climate change are evidenced in profound changes to our rivers and water resources. You've likely seen it where you live: Floods are more damaging and frequent. Droughts are deeper and longer. Uncertainty is destabilizing industry and lives.</p><p>By galvanizing action for healthy rivers and managing our water resources more effectively, we can insure future generations against the consequences of climate change. First, we must safeguard rivers that are still healthy and free-flowing. Second, we must protect land and property against the ravages of flooding. And finally, we must promote policies and practical solutions that take the science of climate disruption into account when planning for increased flooding, water shortage and habitat disruption.</p><p>Imagine all that rivers do for us. Most of our towns and cities have a river running through them or flowing nearby. Rivers provide clean drinking water, irrigate crops that provide our food, power our homes and businesses, provide wildlife habitat, and are the lifeblood of the places where we enjoy and explore nature, and where we play and nourish our spirits. Healthy watersheds help <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059952\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mitigate</a> climate change, absorbing and reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Healthy rivers and floodplains help communities adapt and build resilience in the face of climate change by improving flood protection and providing water supply and quality benefits. Rivers are the cornerstones of healthy, strong communities.</p><p>The more than <a href=\"https://archive.epa.gov/water/archive/web/html/index-17.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3 million miles</a> of rivers and streams running across our country are a source of great strength and opportunity. When we invest in healthy rivers and clean water, we can improve our lives. When we invest in rivers, we create jobs and strengthen our economy. When we invest in rivers, we invest in our shared future.</p><p class=\"\"><em></em></p><p> <em>Katy Neusteter is the marketing director for <a href=\"https://www.americanrivers.org/\" target=\"_blank\">American Rivers</a>.</em></p><p><em><span></span>This article first appeared on </em><a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/restoring-our-water-systems-should-be-top-priority-for-biden-administration/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Truthout</em></a><em> and was produced in partnership with </em><a href=\"https://independentmediainstitute.org/earth-food-life/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Earth | Food | Life</em></a><em>, a project of the Independent Media Institute</em><em>.</em></p>From Your Site ArticlesHow Can the Biden Administration Fix America's Broken Food ... ›Related Articles Around the WebAt Dawn of Biden Administration, Opportunities for Water Systems ... ›Read More Show Lessbiden administration water climate change environment food health care politics scienceTrendinginsectsTrillions of Brood X Cicadas to Emerge in 15 States This Spring22 JanuarysponsoredBest Dry Herb Vaporizer - Top 14 Products of 202108 December 2020biden administrationRestoring Our Water Systems Should Be Top Priority for Biden Administration7hinsectsTrillions of Brood X Cicadas to Emerge in 15 States This SpringOlivia Rosane22 JanuaryAnimalsA Brood X cicada in 2004. Pmjacoby / CC BY-SA 3.0Fifteen states are in for an unusually noisy spring.<p>Brood X, the largest and most widespread colony of cicadas in the U.S., is due to emerge from their 17-year hibernation, <a href=\"https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2020/ask-the-expert-how-to-prepare-for-the-2020-cicada-invasion/#:~:text=Brood%20X%20(10)%2C%20the,again%20next%20year%20in%202021.\" target=\"_blank\">Michigan State University entomologist Gary Parsons explained</a>. The bugs typically emerge as early as mid-May, and the sound of their mating can reach 100 decibels, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/trillions-brood-10-cicadas-emerge-us-17-years-underground-1562608\" target=\"_blank\">Newsweek reported</a>. And there will be lots of them.</p><p>\"Densities can be as great as 1.5 million per acre. So, between Georgia and New York there will surely be trillions emerging,\" emeritus professor of entomology at the University of Maryland and Entomological Society of America fellow Michael J. Raupp told Newsweek.</p><p>The cicadas are due to emerge in Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington, DC for the first time since 2004. They will begin to emerge once the ground hits 64 degrees Fahrenheit, usually between mid-May and late June. They will be above ground mating and laying eggs for about five to six weeks, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-brood-x-us-cicada-infestation-coming-in-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">CBS News reported</a>. Then the nymphs will dig into the ground to suck tree roots for another 17 years, Parsons explained.</p><p>The brood's large numbers and long hibernation period is part of an evolutionary strategy millions of years old.</p><p>\"It is thought that by having the longlife cycles, cicadas have prevented predators from specifically targeting them for food. Then by emerging in the millions all at once, they are too numerous for any predators that do eat them from ever wiping them out. There are so many of them that lots of them will always survive,\" Parsons said.</p><p>In addition, the long hibernation times helped the cicadas avoid unseasonably cold summers, CBS News explained. In the Pleistocene Epoch, 1.8 million years ago, summers could be much colder in the Eastern U.S. But cicadas can't survive above ground for long if the temperature stays below 68 degrees Fahrenheit. So they evolved to emerge infrequently to reduce their chances of hitting a cold snap.</p><p>Brood X isn't the only cicada brood in the country. There are other broods with 13 or 17 year cycles, as well as annual cicadas with three to four year cycles, Parsons said. Many of them have been impacted by recent environmental changes.</p><p>\"In the long ago past, it is likely the different broods were more widespread geographically,\" he said. \"It is likely that urbanization, widespread commercial farming and other factors have reduced and limited them over the years. You take away the trees and shrubs in forests and they don't have the roots to feed on. Fortunately, they have adapted well to using street trees, parks and yard trees as their hosts and can still survive in urbanized areas.\"</p><p>This can be a nuisance for some and a dramatic sight for others, but the cicadas are not dangerous. They do not bite, spread disease or eat crops, CBS News pointed out. They also are not poisonous to pets, though sometimes dogs will eat so many of them that they get sick, Parsons said.</p><p>The one thing that they do harm is newly-planted trees.</p><p>\"Don't plant next spring, because these trees are going to simply get hammered next year when those cicadas show up,\" Raupp <a href=\"https://wtop.com/local/2020/05/dont-bug-out-2021-will-see-emergence-of-trillions-of-cicadas/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told WTOP News</a> in 2020.</p><p>Raupp said any trees planted in 2020 could also be in danger. If you did plant last year, Raupp said to protect the young tree with netting and not to use pesticides.</p><p>Once the trees are taken care of, Raupp encouraged people to enjoy the spectacle.</p><p>\"[T]his is a wonderful opportunity for millions of people to witness and enjoy a remarkable biological phenomenon in their own backyard that happens nowhere else on the planet, truly a teachable moment,\" he told Newsweek.</p>From Your Site ArticlesMillions of Cicadas Set to Emerge After 17 Years Underground ... ›Cicadas Show Up 4 Years Early - EcoWatch ›Related Articles Around the Web'There will be billions': Some cicadas are emerging now, but in 2021 ... ›Some periodical cicadas are emerging in spots around Chicago and ... ›Brood Awakening: 17-Year Cicadas Emerge 4 Years Early ... ›Read More Show Lessinsects animals biodiversity wildlifewildlifeCould a 'Bigfoot Hunting Season' Promote Tourism and Wildlife Protection?Emily Denny22 JanuaryAnimalsA creative depiction of bigfoot in a forest.
