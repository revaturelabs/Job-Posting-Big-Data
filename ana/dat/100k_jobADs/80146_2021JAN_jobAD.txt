The system leads to a fuel reduction of up to 5% per vehicle, which delivers lower CO2 emissions. In the new generation of the Mercedes-Benz Actros, the latest PPC technology is available. The public premiere was at IAA 2018.As the first smart cruise control system in commercial vehicles, PPC actively controls engine, brakes, and automated transmission. Thanks to TomTom’s ADAS map, the system is familiar with the topography, curvature, speed limit (including truck-specific speed limits) and traffic signs, meaning it can respond in a manner that delivers the most fuel-efficient performance.Bosch’s electronic horizon is used to integrate knowledge of the road ahead into the driving strategy of the new Mercedes-Benz Actros. It provides required map data per ADAS protocol in a new and innovative way allowing relaxed, safe and efficient driving.Antoine Saucier, Managing Director, TomTom Automotive, said: “The new PPC technology is using the TomTom ADAS Map to assist with driving functions on interurban roads – which not only delivers a safer, more comfortable ride but also significant fuel savings and a reduction in CO2 emissions.”Tags # Bosch # Daimler Trucks # Technology News # TomTomTweet	Share	Pin it	WhatsappComment	TomTomBy Truckingjobs.co.uk at January 04, 2020Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels: Bosch, Daimler Trucks, Technology News, TomTomNo comments:Post a commentNewer Post Older Post HomeSubscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)Follow by EmailFollow us on social mediafacebook count=31k;Followerstwitter count=1.3k;Followersinstagram count=828;FollowersSearch Driving Jobs7.5 tonne driver jobsClass 1 Driver JobsClass 2 (CAT C) Driver JobsSearch Jobs by LocationEast Anglia Driver JobsEast Midlands Driver JobsIreland Driver JobsLincolnshire Driving JobsNorth East Driver JobsNorth West Driver JobsNorthern Ireland Driver JobsScotland Driver JobsSouth East Driver JobsSouth West Driver JobsWales Driver JobsWest Midlands Driver JobsYorkshire Driver JobsLatest NewsDAF Trucks (65)Dealer News (14)Fleet News (322)Haulage News (338)Haulage Products (6)HGV Driver Advice (34)HGV Operator Advice (4)IVECO Trucks (44)MAN Trucks (33)Mercedes Trucks (154)Renault Trucks (27)Scania Trucks (92)Technology News (216)Truck Crime (10)Volvo Trucks (145)Quick Search Jobs7.5 tonne driver jobs (5) Class 1 Driver Jobs (549) Class 2 (CAT C) Driver Jobs (185)Connect With usFollow usCareers IndexBuilders Merchant JobsCourier HGV Driver JobsSupermarket Driver Job IndexTop 100 Haulage CompaniesOur PartnersHaulageHQContact formNameEmail *Message *Contact formNameEmail *Message *Copyright © TruckingJobs.co.uk"
