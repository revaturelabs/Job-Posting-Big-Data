Just recently 6 states across our country have repealed their prevailing wage laws, and for good reason. This bill will needlessly raise the cost of infrastructure projects in our state and make it more difficult for New Hampshire small construction companies to compete with large Massachusetts based companies.” Hinch said.“New Hampshire’s small business community is perfectly capable of reasonably and fairly compensating their workers, and forcing them to pay wages at a rate calculated out of Washington D.C. is unacceptable. Do House Democrats think they are smarter than New Hampshire’s small businesses.”Search for:© House Republican Office | 107 N. Main St. Third Floor | Concord, NH 03301 | (603) 271-3665"
