Fraudsters require sensitive information, such as your date of birth, address, I.D number, or bank details, to succeed. So, none of these should be posted anywhere online.Safety Tips for CandidatesYou should research every recruitment website thoroughly before you sign up and upload your resume to their databases. When you’re looking for a job, it can be tempting to join every platform possible to avoid missing opportunities. However, they certainly aren’t created equal, which means you should do some background checks and read people’s reviews of their experiences before creating an account.Safety Tips for CandidatesOnce you’ve identified some job sites that are reputable, sign up and review your account’s privacy settings before uploading your CV. The best sites to use are those that allow you to choose whether you would like to display your CV publicly, hide some of your information, or keep the entire thing private until you find a job you’re interested in applying for. If any of the websites you’ve picked out don’t give you this option, it might be worth giving them miss as it’s best not to have all of your details online for everyone to see.Safety Tips for CandidatesOnce you’ve identified some job sites that are reputable, sign up and review your account’s privacy settings before uploading your CV.

They may do this by offering you jobs and interviews, or by telling you they’re interested and asking for more of your personal information. If you’re ever unsure about an opportunity you’ve been offered or doubt the authenticity of any communications you’ve received, don’t answer them and report the job listing in question to the website you found it on.Safety Tips for CandidatesNever pay for a job.Quick LinksHomeAll JobsBlogPrivacy PolicyTerms and ConditionsFollow UsFacebookTwitterLinkedinSign Up For Job AlertsSign Up To Receive Job Updates In Your Inbox…© 2020 Jobs263 All rights reserved.
