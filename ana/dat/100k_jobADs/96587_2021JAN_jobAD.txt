Bruh, don’t lose your job over booty.This week, the NY Giants have had a number of practice sessions and Odell has missed all of them. While his teammates are putting in work, Beckham’s been putting in quality time with his new rumored boo, Iggy Igs. The pair was spotted at Bowlero Woodland Hills bowling center on Monday at the same time the Giants were practicing in New Jersey.Sources say Odell and Iggy were snuggled up and super flirty during their little bowling party that included a few more of Beckham’s buddies.And apparently, Azalea isn’t the only person Odell has been spending time with instead of practicing with his team. On Tuesday, the Giants receiver was training with troubled free agent Johnny Manziel.O told me FogiveAllMyEnemies so I’m gunna let em live and stay on this grind #F.A.M.E @obj @jamalligginA post shared by Johnny Manziel (@jmanziel2) on Apr 3, 2017 at 5:47pm PDTNow, it is worth noting that NFL OTAs (organized team activities) are not mandatory, so Odell isn’t necessarily breaking any rules. But, the practice sessions are HIGHLY suggested and typically all teammates show up. Beckham may want to book it back to NY soon … just remember, the general manager, Jerry Reese, had this to say about Odell earlier this year.“I see a guy who needs to think about some of the things that he does. Everybody knows he’s a gifted player, but there’s some things that he’s done that he needs to look at himself in the mirror and be honest with himself about some of the things that he’s done.”Odell has missed Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is believed he informed the Giants that he would be at the team facility today (Thursday) for OTA No. 3. Let’s hope he made it.Popular on Hip HollywoodRelated Topics:Iggy AzaleaOdell Beckham Jr.Up Next5 Controversial Remarks Ben Carson Has Uttered Out Of His Big MouthDon't MissBen Carson Gets Obliterated After Suggesting “Poverty Is A State Of Mind”Continue ReadingAdvertisementClick to commentLeave a ReplyCancel replyYour email address will not be published.
