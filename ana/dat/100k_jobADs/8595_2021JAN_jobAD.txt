Looking to re-energize their existing supporters and engage a new generation of fans, NASCAR is launching a new Digital Media division. This group is all about fast collaborative communication, pushing real time information around the clock. With extremely simple and effective lighting, the space employs the “no material” strategy whenever possible, for a raw, rough, garage like atmosphere with the sharp contrasts of hi-tech zones. The workplace is organized around a single circulation path – a polished concrete “race track” that rings the core. The environment resembles the sport itself: fun, fast, exciting and passionate.ExpertiseInterior Design ?Media ?Related ContentPublicationUnder the Hood: RetailDialogue issueDialogue 25: Work and the MetropolisFour world cities’ work styles Transformative...ShareTwitterFacebookLinkedInEmailContactGensler Fact SheetSite MapNewsletterDiversityTop of page© 2020 Gensler, All Rights Reserved Privacy Statement & Cookie Policy Transparency StatementPlease enable JavaScript to experience the full functionality of www.jobs63.com一本之道高清无码视频_韩国三级电影_香港三级韩国三级日本三级"
