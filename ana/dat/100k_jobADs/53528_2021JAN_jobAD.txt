And one of those must-have tools is a weed eater – or sometimes referred to as a string trimmer. Get every nook, cranny, and narrow strip of lawn clipped and ready to level up your curbside appeal.There are plenty to choose from and plenty of different features to sift through. But, again, we’ve done the dirty work for you. Below you’ll find 7 of the best weed eaters that get the job done. Sift through our finds and, while you’re at it, you may learn a thing or two about those string trimmers, what types there are as well as a few other interesting odds and ends.What Is A Weed Eater?A weed eater is exactly what it sounds like because of what it caters to. It’s a lawn tool that cuts grass, low foliage, or weeds, in the smaller nooks and crannies of one’s yard. You may not know this device by this name though as it has plenty of other variations of names including: string trimmer, weed-whacker, brush cutter, and whipper-snipper. What makes this so different from its mower counterpart is the blade in which it uses to cut; usually made from a very fine line of monofilament, nylon, and other times a chain.What To Look For When Buying:There’s such a variety of of styles, designs, combination devices, and other features to keep in mind when shopping for your new weed eater. You’ll find more simplified models and more powerful models. You’ll find ones that can easily cut thick shrubbery too. You’ll even find designs that do a combination of jobs. It’s important to know what you need before you make the plunge into the shopping journey.Features:Prices:You will find weed eaters are an array of price points. Know going into your venture that the average price for a quality trimmer is around $200, with prices dipping far below that or reaching near $1,000. It’s all dependent on your particular needs, brands you trust, and features you want.ComfortWe suggest ensuring that whatever design you go with includes a comfort grip handle. After an hour of weed eating, you’ll be sorry if you have a handle that’s just made of metal without cushion. Callouses will ensure and blood blisters may come in full force. This is a must for heavier weed eaters, making sure the entire piece is comfortable to maneuver is key.NoiseIt’s just a fact, weed eaters can be incredibly noisy. If you’re looking for something quieter, steer away from gas-powered models. The higher the power level of the engine, the more noise that will ensue. Even with electric or battery-powered options, the noise level will vary.SafetyAll that power doesn’t come with guaranteed safety. You’ll want to make sure those blades are exposed when you’re not working with it. Follower the instructions and use caps when it’s not in use. And make double sure that your weed eater comes with those protective caps. If not, you should be able to purchase them separately.Types Of Weed Eaters:Electric:Firstly, electric weed eaters have cords. Although this may seem inconvenient, the electric run models have so many advantages. They’re usually light-weight and easy to maneuver and the runtime never ends because they’re consistently in contact with their power source. But, if you’re working with a traditional size residential lawn, there may be no negative affects on your experience.These models are also known to be one of the easiest to manage and maintain because of their simplicity. There’s no need to worry about gas, charging, and you can grab an extension cord to make the process and a little less stressful if your space calls for it.Battery-Powered:These devices operate simply and with zero emissions (yay for the environment!). It’s nice to not have to deal with gassing up your weed eater or dealing with the potential mess. You will have to remember to charge them before you get to work though, but the start-up is easy with just the push of a button.Because of their simplicity they are not known for their high-powered appeal, cutting through thicker foliage isn’t their forte. For those with lighter lawns, battery-powered operations may be the perfect choice. Keep in mind that these are also cordless models, so there’s no worry about zigging and zagging a cord through the mud, around the bushes, or not having enough stretch to complete the job. Pro Tip: Check out the running times on the design before you purchase.Gas-Powered:For those that are looking for a weed eater to get some of the harder jobs, then you may need to go with a high-powered gas weed eater. These designs are made to get through the thickest of shrubbery and other foliage. Some gas-powered whackers can even get through some trees.The disadvantage that these may have though are the noise and the fumes. They tend to be quite a bit louder than its brother designs and the fumes from the gas don’t make the experience as healthy or as enjoyable. The device itself will also be heavier than other models. You’ll also notice that you will have the option of 4-cycle or 2-stroke engine designs which will equate to the power you need for your particular lawn.Wheeled:Wheeled or walk behind weed eaters are also quite powerful. For larger yards that have thicker foliage, look into these designs as well. They’re particular nice (although more expensive) when you don’t want to carry around heavy gas-powered trimmers but instead, these wheeled models make the experience and a bit more manageable.Sometimes these devices will eliminate your need for a lawn mower completely – which makes it a smarter, all-in-one purchase that will save you in the long run.Curved Vs. Straight Shaft:Check out the type of shaft your new weed eater too. The shaft is the portion of the trimmer that extends from the engine to the blade and it’s where the transfer of power happens. Curved shafts are known to be lighter and easier to maneuver around touch-to-reach spots whereas straight shafts will always have a longer reach. Again, this is totally dependent on your personalized needs and your particular lawn.Types Of Weed Eater Heads:When it comes to the weed eater heads, there are a few different kinds. Every head will spin in a circle to get the job done but there are different ways of feeding that line to the blade. Here are the options:Automatic Feed:There’s an automatic feed option that works by sending our more line whenever it feels the line is becoming too short. You don’t have to worry about remembering to feed more line yourself, instead, you just keep doing your job and the weed eater uses its own intelligence send the line along. It’s definitely convenient but in the event of an issue, it is a bit harder to fix since the feed line is hidden by the head and may cost more for repair.Fixed Head:For those that don’t want to think about their line at all, you’ll want a fixed head. You won’t have to feed out more line at all until it needs to be replaced. It’s one of the more simple designs with easy maintenance. And they’re also known to be quite powerful with a heavy-duty finish – more so than it’s automatic or bump feed counterparts. You may even see that some fixed heads use chains instead of lines. Be wary of these designs as they can be quite dangerous.Bump Feed:This type of feed is the most straightforward as it allows you to feed more line and customize your trimming needs. You just bump it – actually bump it – against a flat surface to retrieve more line. It’s another job for you to take on but for those that like to feel in control this more manual option may be exactly what you need.7 of the Best Weed Eaters That Get The Job Done1.
