For contractors, it’s even more important. If you have some people sitting in an office and other working out in the field, in your client’s home or businesses, staying in touch immediately becomes more difficult. Fortunately, the advance of technology makes it much easier. Jobi is designed as a mobile workforce dispatch software, allowing you to manage your technicians when they’re out on a job.

You can’t accompany them on every job, so you don’t know whether they’re using their time as wisely as they should be. The right app can change that, allowing you to keep an eye on them and improve productivity. Using Jobi, you can track your technicians and their vehicles so that you know where they are and when. With GPS data and real-time information, you can make better decisions about how your employees should be spending their time.

There’s a lot to consider, from calls and paperwork to employee timesheets and payroll. It’s hard to run a business smoothly and stay on top of everything. One thing that really helps is to have as few pieces of software as possible. The more you can do from one app, the better it is for your business. And when there are things that you can’t do from the same app, you can integrate it with others. For example, Jobi allows you to create paperless invoices and take payments realtime. But when you need to do more with your finances, you can connect to QuickBooks to import and export, making your accounting easier.Informed TechniciansYour technicians need to know what they’re doing when they’re out on a job. They should know what you expect from them, what to offer customers, and how to answer questions. But if they’re confused about what they should be doing, it’s not going to be great for business. This problem can arise from poor communication, but can easily be solved with the right app. Technicians will always know what job they’re going to next with quick scheduling from our job dispatch software while offering clients options with the built in customizable flat rate pricing menu.

Jobi gives you a real-time company dashboard so that you can see customer and tech information more easily. From sales information to technician performance and goal setting, you have the tools and data to make more of your business.Offer Clients Service Options With EaseUpselling can be difficult for small businesses to do, and particularly difficult for service companies. You don’t want to appear to be too pushy, so you might advise your technicians not to be too forward, or they may even be hesitant to be too assertive about suggesting further work. However, you could be missing out on valuable profits if you’re too shy about upselling. Many people actually prefer to have a number of service options, which is why Jobi’s service options are ideal. You can offer clients a choice without feeling like you’re being too pushy.
