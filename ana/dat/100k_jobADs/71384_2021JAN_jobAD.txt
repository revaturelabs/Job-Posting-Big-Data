This page will explore some ideas further. And no, I am not talking about Multi-Level-Marketing.FlippingFlipping is an easy, fun and budget friendly way of creating some additional income. No, I am not necessarily talking about flipping houses, but the sky is the limit!! Try thinking a little smaller scale. What are your talents? What are your skills, tools, workspaces? With these in mind, keep a keen eye on Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace and even the sidewalk of Aberdeen neighborhoods. If you spy an item that you may be able to fix up, repair, or even completely remodel then pick it up! Some ideas could be repainting old furniture, re-purposing wooden structures into custom cat trees, repairing broken electronics, even simply buying unique, eye-catching vintage finds from secondhand stores for reselling at their market value. This is an opportunity to educate yourself on vintage comic books, furniture, toys, even clothes. It's your own at-home episode of Storage Wars!​The beauty of flipping is that you don't need any money to start, just keep your eye on free online pages & your neighbourhood corners for furniture that is calling for new life.Kamloops is home to many, many thrift stores across the city. You could spend a whole weekend on a thrift crawl!Some free ways to get started are to start watching youtube videos of thrift hauls to better know what items to look for or of vintage clothes alterations to improve your wardrobe skills. I recently discovered this ebook that gives you some ideas on unique items that may be of value including what brands to seek out. The beauty of flipping is that you don't need any money to start, just keep your eye on free online pages & your neighbourhood corners for furniture that is calling for new life.​Once you have a collection of items of value, it's time to create a small shop online. You can use different platforms depending on what you are selling.Ebay is a great platform for selling almost anything, but it is also very helpful for research purposes. A trick for researching the value of an item to sell, search a description of the item you are trying to find, hit \"Advanced\", and find the box \"Sold Items Only\". Each listing will now show up in green, symbolizing a past transaction of that item that you can use as a reference.Etsy is a great community of artists & vintage lovers alike. If your item is customized, or vintage - at least 20 years old, then it can be sold via a shop on Etsy.​For heavier, bulkier items it is often easier to resell using online forums such as Kijiji, Craigslist & Facebook Marketplace.​This online E-book by The Green Room called 100 Amazing Items to Resell was a great introduction into random items that I had no idea had value. This gave me a better outlook when shopping for items to resell.ThriftingLocal Non-Profit Thrift ShopsSecond Chances ValleyviewProceeds go to Kamloops SPCA168 Oriole Rd.,Kamloops, B.C., V2C 2B4(236) 425-1615​Monday-Saturday 10am-5pmSunday - ClosedSecond Chances North ShoreProceeds go to Kamloops SPCA1211 – 8th St.,Kamloops, B.C., V2B 2Y3(778) 470-0055​Monday-Saturday 10am-5pmSunday - ClosedReStoreProceeds to go to Habitat for Humanity1425 Cariboo Pl #28,Kamloops, BC V2C 5Z3(250) 828-7867​Monday-Saturday 9am-5pmSunday 10am-4pmFlutter Buys Thrift StoreProceeds go to Snowden Memorial Hospice Home1800 Tranquille Rd #14,Kamloops, BC V2B 3L9(250) 376-1335​Monday-Saturday 9am-5pmSunday - ClosedSimply the Best Thrift StoreProceeds go to Inclusion Kamloops662 Seymour St,Kamloops, BC V2C 2H2(250) 377-8335Monday-Saturday 9:30am-4pmSunday - Closed​Thrift SellerProceeds to go to Royal Inland Hospital146 Victoria St,Kamloops, BC V2C 1Z7(250) 374-0487Monday-Saturday 10am-4pmSunday 11am-3pm​Crafting; Needlepoint, Sewing, Cross StitchingThe potential is limitless when it comes to sewing. You can make linen, clothing, upcycled clothing, curtains, pet toys, and so much more. Through a keen eye in thrift stores across town, you should be able to find a decent modern sewing machine for around $40 to get you started. There are countless Youtube videos on how to sew, hem, and flip.Needlepoint & Cross stitching are historically passtimes of women, therefore there has been very little appreciation or artistic value in this art medium since it's time. With the feminist movement and more empowering art potential, making a career out of a needle & thread is become so much more within reach. Many artists create their own work and sew it into fabric, others use patterns to make very intricate designs and pictures. There is even this webpage that allows you to upload a photograph to be turned into a cross-stitching pattern!​The concept of cross-stitching is so simple that nearly anybody can do it. Some tips I learned were to master how to anchor the thread first, use three strands of thread at a time, and always have good lighting to ensure the best outcome for your eyes. You can get creative by making your own designs, creating your own portraits or quotes.House-Sitting & Pet SittingIf you are somebody who enjoys house-sitting, plant-sitting, and looking after animals you might want to consider doing this on the side. By simply making up some online ads and community posters, you are creating an opportunity for you to earn additional income while getting all the animal therapy you could ask for. Try to think of some qualifications that make you stand out from other house-sitters such as being willing to clean, or having experience in animal care already. Try placing an ad on Kijiji or using the app called __dog sitter app__ to secure a clientele in the dog-walking business.House-CleaningThe need to maintain cleanliness in one's life will never go away, which is why there is some security in developing a side-gig in house cleaning. You are already probably pretty good about house cleaning given that you live at home yourself, so perhaps there is fun in cleaning another's house.
