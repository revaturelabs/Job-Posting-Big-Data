Does this qualify as discrimination? Skyline Global is a front company for Al-Khaleej Education and Al-Khaleej does the hiring.Their hiring process is lengthy with a background check on your criminal, education, and work histories.On top of that, there is a medical exam which asks you to be tested for typhoid, cholera, and maleria. These are diseases which haven't been seen in the U.S. for decades. If you don't have quick access to a medical doctor, be prepared to spend a lot of money for medical testing. I was lucky enough to have the VA do it for me in U.S. You might be able to get a local clinic to do it or get referrals for you.It sucks, but what are the options?Back to topKirbymuxloeJoined: 09 Dec 2011Posts: 1Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 1:18 pm Post subject:The Middle East can be referred to as a diverse region of the world.

Most of these developments have been crucial to the humankind development.This would be true...up to about 1500AD. Minus the cars and the oil wells (both of which are borrowed technologies), it hasn't advanced or developed much since then. Diverse? In what way? Perhaps in term of people, yet segregated by religion and classes. It doesn't feel very \"diverse\" in my sense of the definition. Certainly not so in terms of landscape.If you want to skip the high end medical bills and supersede a lot of red tape, you will have to get hired out of the US. They may tell you that's impossible, can't get a visa, etc., but that is simply not true: I've done it three times.Back to topDisplay posts from previous: All Posts1 Day7 Days2 Weeks1 Month3 Months6 Months1 Year Oldest FirstNewest FirstESL Jobs Forum Forum Index -> ESL in Africa & S.W.
