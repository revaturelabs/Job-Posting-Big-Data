Then look for ecological services of those plants and build the polyculture suited to your site. If the plant grows on your site, look for plants that also grow on the site and build the poly culture-plant guild from there.Dan	CommentThere are no comments made yet.	more than a month agoPlant Questions & Answers# 1	Kaya Lovestrand	Accepted Answer Pending Moderation0	Votes	UndoI recently added Jojoba to the database along with a number of other multi-use plants with similar native habitats. There are a number of good options depending on what you are looking for. The California Native Plant Society suggests some \"companion\" plants on their web page for Jojoba: http://calscape.cnps.org/Simmondsia-chinensis-(Jojoba)?srchcr=sc560cf7cf8622f.
