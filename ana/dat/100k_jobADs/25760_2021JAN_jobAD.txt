Most of the affected factories build cars that won't be sold in the U.S. after next year. They could close or they could get different vehicles to build. They will be part of contract talks with the United Auto Workers union next year.Plants without products include assembly plants in Detroit; Lordstown, Ohio; and Oshawa, Ontario. Also affected are transmission factories in Warren, Michigan, as well as Baltimore.More than 6,000 factory workers could lose jobs in the U.S. and Canada, although some could transfer to truck and SUV plants.GM, the largest automaker in the U.S. and includes the Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac and GMC brands, said the moves will save $6 billion in cash by the end of next year, including $4.5 billion in recurring annual cost reductions and a $1.5 billion reduction in capital spending.Those cuts are in addition to $6.5 billion that the company has announced by the end of this year.AdvertisementGM doesn't foresee an economic downturn and is making the cuts \"to get in front of it while the company is strong and while the economy is strong,\" CEO Mary Barra told reporters.Barra said GM is still hiring people with expertise in software and electric and autonomous vehicles, and many of those who will lose their jobs are now working on conventional cars with internal combustion engines.Barra said the industry is changing rapidly and moving toward electric propulsion, autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing, and GM must adjust with it.The factories up for possible closure are part of GM's effort \"to right-size our capacity for the realities of the marketplace,\" as consumers shift away from cars to trucks and SUVs.The company, she said, has invested in newer architectures for trucks and SUVs so it can cut capital spending while still raising investment in autonomous and electric vehicles.The salaried reductions amount to 15 percent of GM's North American workforce out of 54,000. At the factories, 3,000 workers could lose jobs in Canada and another 3,600 in the U.S. Some U.S. workers would transfer to truck and SUV plants where GM is increasing output, the company said.GM has offered buyouts to 18,000 retirement-eligible workers with a dozen or more years of service. It would not say how many have accepted the buyouts, but it was short of the company's target because GM said there will be white-collar layoffs.The company expects to take a pretax charge of $3 billion to $3.8 billion due to the actions, including up to $1.8 billion of asset write downs and pension charges. The charges will take place in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of next year.Just in...FOX 5's top stories on InstagramFBI releases details about new arrests made for involvement in U.S. Capitol attackFairfax teachers' union asks school district to push back return to class after vaccine shortageLive NowBiden delivering remarks on COVID-19 efforts amid rising confusion surrounding vaccine rolloutVice President Kamala Harris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff receive 2nd COVID-19 vaccineTrendingMontgomery County cops accused of harassing 5-year-old boyVirginia the 'only state reporting significant increases' in COVID cases: report‘Call the pros’: Chick-fil-A helps direct gridlocked traffic at S.C. drive-thru COVID-19 vaccine sitePrince George’s County restoring indoor dining at 25% on FridayNational Guard troops testing positive for COVID-19 claim they are not receiving appropriate medical attentionNewsLocal NewsNational NewsConsumerCrimePoliticsViral2020 ElectionD.C. voting guideMaryland voting guideVirginia voting guideCoronavirusLIVE MAP: Worldwide casesHow you can helpSymptomsDMV restaurants and businesses that will not reopenWeatherClosingsForecastLive CamerasFOX 5 Weather AppTrafficMoneyPersonal FinanceCOVID-19 & The EconomyGood DayCooking With ComoLights!
