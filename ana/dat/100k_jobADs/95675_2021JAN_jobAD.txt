Dannel P. MalloyChristine Stuart — CT News Junkie file photoROCKY HILL >> More than a thousand state employees are expected to lose their jobs as part of Connecticut’s efforts to address a $900 million budget deficit, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said Friday.Malloy told reporters the exact number of workers to be dismissed has not been determined but it could easily approach 2,000.“It’s hard adjusting to this new economic reality. It requires hard decisions to be made,” the Democratic governor said after a tour of a state laboratory in Rocky Hill.Already, the Department of Correction has said 147 workers will lose their jobs. Commissioner Scott Semple said in a memo Thursday to department employees that the layoff notifications are expected to begin going out around mid-April.“For those of you who are ultimately impacted directly, my hope is that you may take some amount of solace in the knowledge that these actions are in no way a reflection of you,” Semple wrote. “It is an unfortunate business decision that we must face as part of a new economic reality challenging our state.”Most PopularFeds indict alleged Bridgeport gang membersFeds: ‘Buddha’ sentenced to nearly 5 years for gun possession‘Bone Finder’ flags disturbed areas, leading to dig at former Dulos propertyPeople’s United Bank to phase out branch operations in Stop & Shop storesEditor-in-Chief: Adrianna brings hope after uncle, 30, dies with COVIDUnity Pharmacy closes Bridgeport and Fairfield locationsThe Dish: Owner of the popular Polpo to open second restaurant in GreenwichOther agencies are expected to announce cuts in the coming weeks.The new fiscal year that begins July 1 is projected to be at least $900 million in deficit.
