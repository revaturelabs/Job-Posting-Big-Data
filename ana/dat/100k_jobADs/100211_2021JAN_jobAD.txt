While you may enjoy many of the jobs you undertake around the house, there are some that are not quite so enticing. Here’s a guide to the good, the bad, and the ugly of home maintenance.The Good: Decorating and DIYMost of us look forward to putting our own stamp on our homes and creating a personalized space that makes us feel comfortable, relaxed, and content. If you’ve moved, or you fancy revamping or refreshing the decor, it’s a great idea to plan ahead.Browse online galleries, think about places you have been to, and gather ideas and inspiration from magazines or TV makeover shows. The beauty of interior design is that you can mix and match elements from different images or projects to create a look that is perfect for your home.Once you know what you want, you can set about working out how you are going to bring that vision to life. There may be lots of DIY and decorating jobs you can do yourself, but you might also need to call in the professionals. If this is the case, research reputable firms in your area and get a series of quotes before you make a decision.The Bad: Cleaning and DeclutteringSome people may love nothing more than cleaning and decluttering, but for many of us, this is a job we tend to put off. The problem is that dirty floors, messy rooms, and piles of clutter don’t just go away, and molehills can turn into mountains.The best way to keep your home clean and clutter-free is to tidy as you go. Resist the temptation to close the door on a pile of dishes or a cloakroom strewn with coats, scarves, and boots. If you can whizz around putting everything back where it belongs before you go to bed each night, this will make a difference.If you are prone to collecting clutter, it’s wise to organize a clear-out to get rid of anything you don’t need or want anymore and to consider investing in storage solutions.The Ugly: Basic Plumbing and Problems with the WaterworksNobody looks forward to the day they find themselves plunging a toilet, but this is a reality many homeowners have to face. If you’ve got a blockage in the bathroom, your faucets are dripping constantly in the kitchen, or you’re worried about an unusual or pungent odor coming from your drains, it’s wise to brush up on some basic plumbing skills.You can find incredibly informative guides and videos online. If you can’t solve the problem, don’t try any newfangled, novel approaches, as you may end up doing more harm than good. It’s better to admit defeat and call in the experts than to cause more damage.Final Thoughts on Homeowner JobsThere are many perks to owning your own home, but assuming the responsibility for a property may also involve tackling some less appealing and enjoyable jobs.About the authorAnnieWebsiteI'm a mama to four and grandma to six.
