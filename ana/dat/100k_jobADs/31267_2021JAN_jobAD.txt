This assumption has provided cover for the devastating social and economic costs of job insecurity. It is also false.In this presentation, Pavlina R. Tcherneva challenges us to imagine a world where the phantom of unemployment is banished and anyone who seeks decent, living-wage work can find it -guaranteed. This is the aim of the Job Guarantee proposal: to provide a voluntary employment opportunity in public service to anyone who needs it. Tcherneva enumerates the many advantages of the Job Guarantee over the status quo and proposes a blueprint for its implementation within the wider context of the need for a Green New Deal.Pavlina R. Tcherneva, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor of Economics at Bard College and a Research Scholar at the Levy Economics Institute, NY. She specializes in Modern Monetary Theory and public policy.Sunday Platform is our most important and long-standing community event. These gatherings educate, stimulate personal growth, inspire reflection and action, and strengthen our community. Sunday meetings usually begin with music, followed by greetings and a talk given by a Society Leader, member, or guest. Platforms cover a variety of topics that reflect current events, pressing social issues, and Ethical Culture philosophy. A collection basket is passed and money is shared between the Society and a charity selected for that day. While contributions are always appreciated, Sunday meetings are free and open to the public. Each Sunday meeting is followed by a luncheon and social hour.To view previous Sunday Platform addresses and interviews, visit the Ethical NYC YouTube channel.Recent PostsETHICAL ~ Marching forth for Racial Justice, Hand-in-hand with New Partnerships January 19, 2021Leader Emeritus Khoren Arisian, 1932-2021 January 19, 2021Sunday: “The Rise and Fall of American Democracy: A 2020 Election Postmortem” with Renaldo Pearson January 18, 2021Singing An Important Story: The Montgomery Bus Boycott January 12, 2021Sunday: “An Old White Woman Talks About Racism” with Leader Emerita Anne Klaeysen January 11, 2021Upcoming EventsFri	22Proactive Meditation and Deep Listening (Online)January 22 @ 2:00 pm - 3:00 pm	Sun	24Young Ethical Explorers: Bias Awareness Workshop w/ Dr. Bentley Gibson (Online)January 24 @ 11:00 am - 12:30 pm	Sun	24Sunday Platform – Renaldo Pearson: “The Rise and Fall of American Democracy: A 2020 Election Postmortem” (Online)January 24 @ 11:00 am - 12:30 pm	View More…	Previous PostRichard Koral: \"The True Cost of Inequality\"Next PostJoin American Ethical Union Anti-Racism Book Discussions in OctoberRelated PostsSunday PlatformVideo	Joe Chuman: The Only Way From Here is UpEd BeckJanuary 10, 2021Sunday PlatformVideo	Alice Smith: Discrimination Dressed as Protecting Civil RightsEd BeckJanuary 3, 2021Video	Dr. Adam Jarrett: “In the Time of Covid: One Hospital’s Struggles and Triumphs”Ed BeckDecember 21, 2020AboutAbout Ethical NYCOur HistoryLeadership & StaffDonateOur CommunityWhy Join Ethical NYCEthical Member CommitteesWeddings & CeremoniesMembers OnlyWhats CurrentNewsEvents CalendarPrograms & EducationSupport UsContactNewsletter SignupContact UsRentals© 2021 Ethical NYC. 2 West 64th Street New York, NY 10023Site by Moonpool	HomeAbout UsAbout Ethical NYCOur HistoryOur Meeting HouseLeadership & StaffOur CommunityAbout MembershipMember CommitteesWeddings & CeremoniesAwardsNewsLatestEthical Outlook NewsletterLeader MessagesLatest VideosPressVideosEvents CalendarSundays at the SocietyYouth & FamilyEducation & EnrichmentEthics in ActionSocial ServicesRentalsDonateContact UsMember PortalSkip to contentOpen toolbarAccessibility ToolsGrayscale	High Contrast	Negative Contrast	Light Background	Links Underline	Readable Font	ResetSitemap"
