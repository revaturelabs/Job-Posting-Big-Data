The company, headquartered in Bothell, Washington, is the industry leader in antibody-drug conjugates or ADCs, a technology designed to harness the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells. Antibody-drug Conjugates are intended to spare non-targeted cells and thus reduce many of the toxic effects of traditional chemotherapy, while potentially enhancing antitumor activity. The company's flagship product Adcetris is commercially available for four indications in more than 65 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Japan and members of the European Union. To expand on the clinical opportunities of brentuximab vedotin, Seattle Genetics is conducting a broad clinical development program to evaluate its therapeutic potential in earlier lines of its approved indications as well as in a range of other lymphoma and non-lymphoma settings. The company is jointly developing brentuximab vedotin in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. Under the terms of the collaboration, Seattle Genetics has full commercialization rights to brentuximab vedotin in the United States and Canada. Takeda has exclusive rights to commercialize the product candidate in all other countries. In addition to brentuximab vedotin, Seattle Genetics' product pipeline includes enfortumab vedotin, being co-developed with Astellas Pharma, tisotumab vedotin, being co-developed with Genmab, SGN-LIV1A, an ADC targeting LIV-1, and several immuno-oncology agents in phase 1 studies.Total Jobs:116Total Experts:2Average Pay:$149,454Total value of jobs:$32,880,000% Masters:35%Learn More About Seattle Genetics* Ladders EstimatesMore Jobs at Seattle GeneticsTalent Discovery Specialist$80K — $100KSeattle Genetics•Bothell, WA 9801114 days agoSenior System Administrator$80K — $100KSeattle Genetics•Remote14 days agoSenior Statistical Programmer$100K — $150KSeattle Genetics•Bothell, WA 9801114 days agoSenior Manager Quality Systems Validation$200K — $250KSeattle Genetics•Bothell, WA 9801114 days agoSenior Manager Marketing$80K — $100KSeattle Genetics•Seattle, WA 9816014 days agoSimilar JobsManager Biomarker Data Management$100K — $150KSeattle Genetics•Bothell, WA 9801114 days agoBiomarker Operations Manager, Oncology$80K — $100KLabConnect•Remote2 days agoScientific Manager, Clinical Biomarker$80K — $100KTakeda•Boston, MA 021086 days agoManager, Clinical Biomarker Operations$80K — $100KTurning Point Therapeutics, Inc.•San Diego, CA 92101TodayBD Manager, Biomarker Solutions$100K — $150KChampions Oncology•San Diego, CA 9210113 days agoMore Pharmaceuticals & Biotech JobsOperations Supervisor$110K — $130KConfidential Company•Texarkana, AR 718542 days agoClinical Supply CTM Management$170K — $180KMarlborough, MA 017525 days agoRegulatory Affairs Manager$140K — $150KMadison, NJ 079405 days agoPrincipal Medical Writer Consultant$190K — $200KMarlborough, MA 017526 days agoSr. Accounting Revenue Manager$190K — $200KMarlborough, MA 017527 days agoFind similar manager biomarker data management jobs:NationwideRemoteNews & Career AdviceJob SearchThese are the 5 college majors that will make you a top earner for lifeCW HeadleyThese people will get hired in 2021Kyle Schnitzer4 digital tools that will help you stand out to recruitersBella WananaLegal Privacy Press & Media Work at LaddersHighest-Paying Jobs Highest-Paying Companies Highest-Paying Careers Highest-Paying Industries Cities & States Expert Network News & Career Advice DirectoryFAQs Member Help Recruiter Help Contact Us Unsubscribe© Ladders, Inc.Legal | Privacy | Press & Media | Work at LaddersHighest-Paying Jobs | Highest-Paying Companies | Highest-Paying Careers | Highest-Paying Industries | Cities & States | Expert Network | News & Career Advice DirectoryFAQs | Member Help | Recruiter Help | Contact Us | Unsubscribe© Ladders, Inc."
