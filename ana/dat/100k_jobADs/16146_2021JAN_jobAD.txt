Now it’s time to think about some longer-term goals. What do you want to accomplish next with your money? Do you need to save more? Do you want to buy a home someday? Invest?What’s the next step you should take? What are some specific things you can do to take your finances to the next level?We’ve got some ideas for you:1. See if You Can Get More Money From This CompanyTina Russell/The Penny HoarderHere’s the deal: If you’re not using Aspiration’s debit card, you’re missing out on extra cash. And who doesn’t want extra cash?Yep. A debit card called Aspiration gives you up to a 10% back every time you swipe.Need to buy groceries? Extra cash.Need to fill up the tank? Bam. Even more extra cash.You were going to buy these things anyway — why not get this extra money in the process?Enter your email address here, and link your bank account to see how much extra cash you can get with your free Aspiration account. And don’t worry. Your money is FDIC insured and under a military-grade encryption. That’s nerd talk for “this is totally safe.”2. Invest Like a Tycoon (Even If You’re Not Rich)Take a look at the Forbes Richest People list, and you’ll notice almost all the billionaires have one thing in common — they own another company.But if you work for a living and don’t happen to have millions of dollars lying around, that can sound totally out of reach.That’s why a lot of people use the app Stash. It lets you be a part of something that’s normally exclusive to the richest of the rich — buying pieces of other companies for as little as $1.*That’s right — you can invest in pieces of well-known companies, such as Amazon, Google or Apple, for as little as $1. The best part? When these companies profit, so can you. Some companies even send you a check every quarter for your share of the profits, called dividends.Become a tycoon by entering your email address to create a Stash account. They’ll even give you a $5 sign-up bonus once you deposit $5 into your account!**3. Leave Your Family up to $1 MillionGaudiLab/Getty ImagesOh, to be a millionaire. Look, not all of us have the money to set up trust funds for our loved ones. But you could still leave them up to $1 million in life insurance — and you don’t even need to have the money in the bank.You’re probably thinking: I don’t have the time or money for that. But this take minutes — and you could leave your family up to $1 million with a company called Bestow.We hear people are paying as little as $16 a month. (But every year you wait, this gets more expensive.)Begin by entering your birthday, heigh and weight to get a free quote and see how much life insurance you can leave your loved ones — even if you don’t have seven figures in your bank account.4. Let This Company Pay Your Credit Card Bill This MonthNo, like… the whole bill. All of it.While you’re stressing out over your debt, your credit card company is getting rich off those insane interest rates. But a website called Payoff could help you pay off that bill as soon as tomorrow.Here’s how it works: Payoff can match you with a low-interest loan you can use to pay off every credit card balance you have. The benefit? You’re left with just one bill to pay every month, and because the interest rate is so much lower, you can get out of debt so much faster. Plus, no credit card payment this month.If your credit score is at least 640, Payoff can help you borrow $5,000 to $40,000 with fixed rates starting at 5.99%.Payoff won’t make you stand in line or call a bank. And if you’re worried you won’t qualify, it’s free to check online. It takes just a few minutes, and it could save you thousands of dollars — and raise your FICO score by up to 40 points. Totally worth it.All that credit card debt — and the anxiety that comes with it — could be gone by tomorrow.(Payoff operates in every U.S. state except Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nebraska and Nevada.)5. Cancel Your Car InsuranceHere’s the thing: your current car insurance company is probably overcharging you. But, who has the time to look around for around a new company?A company called Gabi will do it for you for free. It gets people an average of $961 back in their bank accounts a year — and you’ll get the same coverage you already have.It doesn’t matter when you last renewed; you can get a check from your old company for the time left on your previous policy. (Read: They probably owe you money.)You don’t have to make any calls or fill out any forms. It takes two minutes to see how much Gabi can put back in your pocket. And the best part? Because we’re driving less, some insurers are slashing prices this month.6. Buy an Apartment Building (Even If You’re Not a Millionaire)Maybe you’ve thought about investing some of that $1,000, but you’re not sure now’s the time. This year has been a rollercoaster. Historically, though, real-estate investing offers the best long-term returns. (Does the name Rockefeller ring a bell?)That’s why we like investing with pros like DiversyFund. They’ll help you make long-term investments in apartments and office buildings all over the country — and you don’t have to be a millionaire. You can get started with only $500.You can see exactly which properties are included in your portfolios — like a 200-unit apartment complex in Killeen, Texas or a 59-unit building in San Diego. And you don’t have to be the landlord — DiversyFund does all the heavy lifting.Because they know how to ride out the market’s ups and downs, they’ve historically seen annual returns of 17% to 18%, though they can’t make any promises.As a partial owner, you make money on rent payments and when property values go up. It takes just a few minutes to sign up and own your first apartment building.*The Penny Hoarder is a Paid Affiliate/partner of Stash.
