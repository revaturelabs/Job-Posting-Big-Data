Our floor was old quarry tiles which were not as straightforward to clean, due to a previous attempt at cleaning by another company. Tom was conscientious is his approach. . . to a difficult mammoth task. He made sure that we were completely happy with the end result. Well done Tom!Jean T, PertenhallTom always replied quickly to emails. He followed Covid measures well, and even quoted us ‚Äòvirtually‚Äô using photos, then turned up on time and put protective sheeting down while working in our bathroom. He ta ked me through the process and what to expect the outcome should be. He asked before doing extra things. The end result was our bathroom, which has fully tiled walls, now looks like new. He cleaned the tiles and grouting, redid some grouting where needed, new sealant etc ‚Äì really pleased with the end result. Polite and tidy too. Would definitely recommend.Nikki K, HistonGood, friendly professional service. Replaced a broken kitchen floor tile, and is returning in a few weeks when our new kitchen has been installed. Would recommend Tom to friends and family.Mrs C, WisbechFantastic results! Tom managed to recover a very damaged marble table and gave great advice on how to care for it in the future. I would definitely recommend.Rachel M, CambridgeTom was polite and professional in the way he carried out the cleaning and polishing of my Mexican tiles in the kitchen, dining room and lobby. I would certainly recommend him. I am very pleased with the result.Sonia G, WickenA painter had made a mess of our patio, and I contracted Tom to clean it up. The price was realistic given the job and Tom went above and beyond to do the best job possible. Very pleased with the result.David M, ElyOur job (replacing some kitchen tiles, cleaning and sealing the entire floor) turned out to be more challenging than expected. Tom worked hard to fix the problems and kept us fully informed throughout the process. He was always on time and very professional.
