While aircraft mechanics focus on the physical components of flying machines, avionics technicians repair the complex electronic systems that help to power them. In 2011, approximately 17,070 avionics technicians worked in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.DutiesAvionics technicians are responsible for inspecting and testing the complex electrical and computer systems that allow aircraft to function. For example, they oversee an airplane's radar system, radio communications equipment and the flight controls. Avionics technicians ensure that these systems are functioning properly before a plane or helicopter takes off. When a problem is found, avionics technicians must repair it before the aircraft can be cleared for takeoff. Avionics technicians also assemble and install electrical components, and keep detailed written records of repair work performed on aircraft.Education and PreparationSome avionics technicians learn their trade while in the military, but most attend 18- to 24-month programs at aviation maintenance technician schools approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA. Technicians may also pursue associate or bachelor's degrees in avionics or aviation technology. The FAA requires all avionics technicians to be licensed, and those who perform maintenance or repairs on aircraft communication systems must be licensed as restricted radio-telephone operators by the Federal Communications Commission.Pay InformationAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, avionics technicians earned an average annual income of $54,390 as of May 2011. More than a quarter of all avionics technicians were employed by the aerospace manufacturing industry, where they earned average pay of $59,670 a year. Those employed by airlines earned an average of $57,210 a year. Nationally, average salaries ranged from a high of $65,100 a year in Connecticut to a low of $33,110 a year in Montana.Job OutlookEmployment among avionics technicians is expected to grow by 7 percent between 2010 and 2020, slightly faster than the 6 percent growth rate expected for aircraft mechanics but significantly slower than the average growth rate of 14 percent expected for the American economy. Competition for jobs is expected to be strong, especially at airlines, many of which outsource some maintenance work to workers in other countries. Candidates with a bachelor's degree should have the best chance of finding a job.2016 Salary Information for Aircraft and Avionics Equipment Mechanics and TechniciansAircraft and avionics equipment mechanics and technicians earned a median annual salary of $60,230 in 2016, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. On the low end, aircraft and avionics equipment mechanics and technicians earned a 25th percentile salary of $48,370, meaning 75 percent earned more than this amount. The 75th percentile salary is $73,680, meaning 25 percent earn more. In 2016, 149,500 people were employed in the U.S. as aircraft and avionics equipment mechanics and technicians.ReferencesBureau of Labor Statistics: Aircraft and Avionics Equipment Mechanics and TechniciansBureau of Labor Statistics: May 2011 Wages for Avionics TechniciansU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: Occupational Outlook Handbook: Aircraft and Avionics Equipment Mechanics and TechniciansCareer Trend: Aircraft and Avionics Equipment Mechanics and TechniciansRelated ArticlesHow Much Do Airplane Technicians Make?The Average Wage for an Airplane MechanicWhat Can You Specialize in as an Aircraft Mechanic?How to Become an Airline MechanicJobs in the Aviation IndustryCommercial Refrigeration Mechanic SalaryAvionics Technician CertificationSalary of Airline MechanicsThe Average Income for Airline PilotsIs Aviation a Good Career?How Much Does a Mechanic Make?How Much Money Do Aircraft Mechanics Make?Most Popular1 How Much Do Airplane Technicians Make?2 The Average Wage for an Airplane Mechanic3 What Can You Specialize in as an Aircraft Mechanic?4 How to Become an Airline MechanicLogo Return to TopAboutPrivacy NoticeYour California Privacy RightsInterest Based AdsTerms of UseOur CompanyCareersAdvertise with UsAd ChoicesContactCustomer ServiceNewsroom ContactsConnectEmail NewsletterFacebookTwitterPinterestGoogleInstagramSubscribeiPad appHoustonChronicle.comHouston Chronicle ArchiveseEdition DemoToday's eNewspaperHearst Newspapers Â© Copyright 2021 Hearst Newspapers, LLC"
