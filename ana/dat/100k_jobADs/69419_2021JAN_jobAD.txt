The usual plan is for the student to alternate periods of school and work experience in appropriate fields of business, industry, government, social services and the professions in accordance with specific requirements.What is a work term?Work terms are typically four, eight or 12 months in duration. At Brock, we can be flexible to meet the needs of our employers/industry. Each four-month term needs to be a minimum of 420 hours (full-time employment based on an average of 35 hours/week).What’s in it for me?While students benefit from the “hands-on, real-world” work experience, employers benefit in a number of ways as well:A cost-effective and low-risk way to recruit and evaluate potential permanent hiresAccess to a workforce of qualified, motivated students with significant academic and employment-readiness training. Brock students are able to hit the ground running and make an immediate contribution to your organizationBrock Co-op students bring a fresh perspective and knowledge of leading-edge concepts to your teamCo-op students are required to fulfil the terms of their employment obligations. The quality of the work term is monitored and formally evaluatedRelief for short-term peaks in workload, as well as help with special projects and research. Hiring Co-op students can also reduce costs associated with recruiting through traditional media sources or third-party vendorsYou may receive federal and provincial wage subsidies and tax credits (the amount varies depending on the program of study)Why should I hire from Brock Co-Op?HIGH QUALITY STUDENTSBrock Co-op Students are highly invested in their work terms. Required as part of their degree program, the students have chosen the Co-op option to gain relevant work experience in their field. Highly motivated students with a positive attitude have been identified repeatedly by our employers as the “Brock difference”. Brock students are exposed to a mixture ofin-class opportunities and experiential education opportunities (including Co-op) to ensure that the skills and techniques they are learning are relevant to, and can have practical applications to, the workforce and the challenges faced by employers.EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE HIRING PROCESSOur continuous hiring process is an effective and efficient practice that allows employers to post positions, interview students and make an offer(s) at any time during the recruitment and selection period. Students will respond to your offer within 48 business hours.What is expected of me as an employer during a work term?Once you have a student in place (see Hiring process), the Brock Co-op Education team continues to be available to support both you and the student throughout the term to ensure the quality of the experience meets both of your expectations. At Brock, we consider our employers as ‘education partners.’To assist in the development of skills and expectations of workplace behaviours, we ask that employers participate in a work site visit approximately halfway through the work term. A Co-op staff team member will arrange to meet with the student and their supervisor individually to discuss their progress and performance. At the end of the work term, a link to an online performance evaluation is sent to supervisors. Our students welcome feedback on their job performance and see it as a vital part of their learning process and professional development.EMPLOYERS:Provide a paid career-related work experience with duties related to the program of studyProvide orientation training and ongoing supervisionEmploy the student for the agreed work-term offeredComplete a work site visit and the final evaluation80% of employers say co-op students are potential future employees**Leger Marketing employer survey for Universities Canda, 2014.DealPrepMagnetCanada Summer Job ProgramWSIB’s Health and Safety Excellence ProgramMember DirectoryBusiness Savings ProgramMember 2 MemberMember SpotlightDigital MarketingSponsorshipTrade Accelerator ProgramCanadian Chamber of Commerce Member Savings ProgramKnow Your PowerExport InformationCertificates of OriginLatest NewsJanuary 26, 2021 | COVID-19 GNCC NewsCOVID-19 Business Update: January 26th, 2021Highly Affected Sectors Credit Availability Program (HASCAP) launched Today, the Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and… more »January 25, 2021 | COVID-19 GNCC NewsCOVID-19 Business Update: January 25th, 2021Government of Ontario extends state of provincial emergency for 14 days Today, the government extended the declared provincial emergency for… more »January 22, 2021 | COVID-19 GNCC NewsCOVID-19 Business Update: January 22nd, 202142,000 applications received for new Ontario Small Business Support Grant The Ontario government has received more than 42,000 applications for… more »80 King St., Unit 3St. Catharines, ON, L2R 7G1 CanadaTelephone: 905-684-2361Fax: 905-684-2100Email: info@gncc.caHOURS OF OPERATION:Monday to Friday, 8:30am to 4:30pm	QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?Contact UsABOUT GNCCVision, Mission, ValuesBoard of DirectorsStaffCOUNCILSGovernment AffairsNEXTNiagaraNon-ProfitWomen in NiagaraAmbassadorMEMBERSMember DirectoryBusiness Savings ProgramMember 2 MemberMember SpotlightDigital MarketingSponsorshipADVOCACYMunicipal AdvocacyProvincial AdvocacyFederal AdvocacyNon-AdvocacyMember AdvocacyEVENTSUpcoming EventsCalendarPhoto GalleriesNEWSMedia ReleasesMembers in the NewsGNCC In The NewsOur Newsletter© 2021 Copyright Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce.
