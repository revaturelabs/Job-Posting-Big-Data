In those cases I'll give a best to worst estimate.I don't work on hourly rates because most people badly underestimate how long a job will take and are upset by a much bigger than expected price when the job is finished. With my fixed price quotes you know what the job is going to cost before I start.I work with minimum mess and disruption to your home or business and clean up the site properly when the job is finished.I'm a non-smoker with a clear police check; national work safety ‘white card’ (formerly 'red card'); and $10 million public liability insurance.If I sound like what you’re looking for, ring me on mobile 0435 825 801.Damian WalshSmall Jobs on time[This business does not have the licence allowing him to quote on Carpentry work over $5,000]SHOW MOREHired:26 timesLast Quoted:Almost 5 years agoResponse time:Within minutesMember since:2013REVIEWS (24)5.024 Reviews54321All 5 Stars (24) 4 Stars (0) 3 Stars (0) 2 Stars (0) 1 Stars (0)Leave a ReviewLoading reviews ...\"Great job!\"Julie from Briar Hill, VIC posted a job for Door Fitters on 25 August 2015\"Great old fashion service and attention to detail.
