In fact the buzz has gotten so big that the newest Internet scam is to push açaí as celebrity-endorsed weight loss products. This is giving açaí, a berry that has “30x the antioxidants of red wine, and an essential fatty acid profile similar to olive oil,” a terrible reputation. I think that we all know that this berry isn’t going to solve all of your problems, but that doesn’t mean that you should miss out on “getting with the purple berry.” Sambazon is a company that does açaí right. They “promote sustainable management of the Brazilian Amazon by providing the highest quality whole food, organic, fair trade Açaí products to consumers.” In other words they make products like juices, smoothies, energy drinks, sorbets, and supplements (with no false promises of instant weight loss like the scammer/spammers). I think that I first heard about Sambazon over a year ago from the Inc 5000, but I’ve been waiting for them to post some jobs that I can feature here.These Jobs Are the BerriesFinally, Sambazon has some jobs that I think that some of you might be interested in, but first you should get to know the company a little better. The best way to do that is to check out their blog. Lately Sambazon co-founder, Ed “Skanda” Nichols, has been doing a series called The Real Deal Açaí Blog Series to address all of the crap that has been going on in the açaí industry. Reading up on this series is probably the best way to get a feel for what the company is about and how they work. If you like what you see and want to be part of the Sambazon Team (which is actually for athletes sponsored by Sambazon), then you should check out Sambazon’s Jobs page, which is hidden in a tiny font on the sidebar of their Contact page. The jobs that they have aren’t exactly ideal for most new college grads, but they look pretty cool. Sambazon is looking for Part-Time Retail Sales Merchandisers/Demonstrators in Dallas/Ft. Worth; TX, Houston, TX; and Seattle, WA. These are sales jobs that require a lot of travel by car, but they’ll get your foot in the door of a company that is cool, exciting, and growing. The application instructions differ depending on which location you’re applying for, so check out the job postings to get all of the details. Also, if you think that you could add something to Sambazon team even though they don’t have a job posted for you, you can always try reaching out to them at jobs@sambazon.comLinks to Help You Begin Your ResearchSambazon.comJobs at SambazonAbout SambazonSambazon in the NewsThe Sambazon BlogSambazon’s FAQHave you ever tried açaí?Related CompaniesWe've identified Sambazon as having career opportunities in the following categories:all employersfoodfood merchandisingorganicsalesTexasWashingtonJobs Near YouBid On Local Painting Jobs - Reach New Customers In Your AreaHomeAdvisor New York, NY ViewBid On Local Remodeling Jobs - Reach New Customers In Your AreaHomeAdvisor New York, NY ViewPackage HandlerHelloFresh Jersey City, NJ ViewPackage HandlerHelloFresh Jersey City, NJ ViewAmazon Warehouse Worker - 4 days/10 hour shiftsAmazon Kearny, NJ ViewLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
