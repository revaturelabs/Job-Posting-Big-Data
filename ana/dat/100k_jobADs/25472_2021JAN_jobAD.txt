Teams who sign up after all positions are filled will be added to a waiting list to be contacted should a slot become available. The waiting list carries over from year to year so signing up as an alternate for this season reserves your position until you forfeit it.Changes for 2019:Fleaflicker is out. Sleeper is in! The new hotness in free fantasy football league services is Sleeper. Fleaflicker's dreary UI has not kept up over the years, and my hope is that moving to Sleeper will reignite some love of the game.In particular, I am hoping that everyone finds the draft experience to be much better than Fleaflicker's room, and that the league site's social features will encourage more communication and interaction. Over the course of the season, we'll see what kind of things we can do with the site's tools to spruce up the experience.Last year's money league was the Chase for the Kolb. This year, it's...Spoiler:the Tebow Crusade:As I had planned last year but did not get into the rules in time, the money payouts for the pay league will be adjusted to go entirely to the top 3 finishers, minus some money used for the grand prize.League Champion: $150 and the TebowLeague Runner-Up: $753rd Place: $50Per discussion in the previous thread, defensive scoring will be adjusted to match Sleeper's default values, except without the minus-points. Therefore:10 points for shutout7 points for yielding 1-6 points4 points for yielding 7-13 points1 point for yielding 14-20 pointsThe Gonzo League shall return, and the floor is now open for rule modification proposals, as well as any other ideas as to how to tweak the league.Rules:While the structure and rules of the GWJFFL are based on the (now defunct) World Championship of Online Fantasy Football, the GWJFFL is a dynamic league and subject to evolution. Please review the official GWJFFL rules to ensure you are familiar with them. (Note: still need to make some edits to this document, coming soon)Leagues:GWJFFL offers leagues in three different formats: redraft, dynasty, and a unique chaotic experience.Redraft format includes both a single \"money league\" that charges an entry fee, as well as system of free leagues, which will number based on the number of players requesting entrance. Any GWJ site member is eligible to join.GWJFFL The Tebow Crusade (\"money league\")GWJFFL Redraft (one or more leagues dependent on player count)GWJFFL DynastyGWJFFL GonzoRegistration:In order to register, reply to this post, stating your desire to play, and in which leagues you are interested in playing.Your post should roughly adhere to the following format:This looks like it's going to be a great year in the GWJFFL.

You added me as co-commish last year so I could do some things but when you ported the league over this year it took that away so I can't do any setup. I'd just need from you some clarification on the draft order settings if it goes by regular season standings for everyone or if the playoffs (and consolation bracket) finishes determine it. I seem to recall the non-playoff teams are set based on regular season (overall record then total points) and playoff teams are set based on playoffs.

Not hearing any naysayers from what was proposed a few months back of being able to trade either a first round pick or 2 later round picks for this year's draft will be in play. Those numbers are a total for the draft, not a per-trade number.-- Sleeper has a keeper limit of 15 whereas we have a limit of 22. I've contacted them and there is no way to increase this so people will need to PM me the (up to) 22 players they want to keep before the draft and I will delete the other players from their roster 2 days before the draft.-- When is good draft sheet is up now beginning 2 weekends before the season begins. Please fill out asap. Default timezone is Eastern but you can change it at the top: https://whenisgood.net/gwjffl2020.-- Only rule change I've selected in the settings is to allow Covid-19 list players to be added to the IR.

Only downside to enabling that now is that people can also add players. Please don't add anybody before the draft.
