Although some games are also based on skills, most sessions are driven by luck. It is this serendipity that makes these games fun, drawing more people to casinos. Hundreds of variants have been developed over the years to fill every corner of the establishments with entertainment. Regardless of the degree of fun all the games offer, slots have been the most popular option because the machines are easy to operate. These machines are equally popular for the opportunities they offer and the stakes they project. In order to elude these hampers and ensure a win, many gamblers rely on methods to cheat the system. Here are some of the sneaky tricks used by some players to beat the casino.1. Cheat CodeCasino authorities work day in and day out to look out for cheaters. The local administrative teams are also functioning to foster a fair game. While engineers design the machines to deliver the best technical assistance, people with expertise in these areas hatch devious plans to take control over the machine. Manipulating slot games was easy for these engineering prodigies. Machines were being cheated for years by Ronald Dale Harris by gathering the source codes. The scam was discovered in 1995.2. Shaved Coins and Fake CoinsPayments were registered using a light sensor in slot machines to avoid scams. However, this technology didn’t work for long as many players tried their wits on the machine. Shaved coins were sent down along with objects of the coin’s shape and size. Once this was accomplished, the shaved coin would return while the machines accepted the other object like a coin to start the game. Louis Colavecchio scammed casinos for a number of years using fake coins that resembled the coins molded by the casinos. However, he was arrested twice for the same crime.3. Use of MagnetsOne of the most common methods of cheating a slot machine is using a magnet. Almost every slot player might be aware of the existence of such a technique. However, modern-day machines cannot be manipulated using magnets since they run on computer programs. Machines made from metal could be cheated using magnets even today. Using a strong magnet after spinning the reels to stop the motion for a winning combination was the whole idea behind this technique. Although this was one of the most easily noticeable cheats, if the players are highly dexterous, they can pull it off easily.4. Yo-YoLike the magnetic technique, this is also obsolete today because of the advancement of technology. Players used to insert coins attached to a string only to pull it out once the machine triggered the game. It used to be one of the classic slot cheats, and it will forever be remembered.Post navigation⟵Casino Jobs That You Can Apply For4 Do’s & Don’ts Tips on How to Win at Slot⟶Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
