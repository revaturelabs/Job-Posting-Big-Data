Physical access to our data centres is restricted to authorized individuals, and we own or directly lease all of our facilities so we have end-to-end control over the grounds, buildings, servers, operations and maintenance for each center. Workplace admins can leverage their security page to monitor unusual security events and view a company security health score. They can also use our APIs, and we have partnered with a variety of industry-standard compliance service providers for policy enforcement and to receive security alerts.Who owns and controls the information my employees create?For Workplace customers the data your employees put into Workplace belongs to your organization. You control it. Your administrators can modify, delete or export it at any time via an API or the Admin Panel. To create a Workplace account, the only mandatory information a user needs to provide is their first and last name, their email address or an employee identifier.Where is my data stored?To protect your data and provide unprecedented performance and availability within our platform, data on Workplace is stored globally across Facebook's data centers located in the US and the EU.What can Facebook do with my data?Anything you upload to Workplace (your customer data) is governed by your enterprise agreement and is provided to Facebook solely to provide the Workplace service and appropriate support to you. Your users will not be targeted by advertising on Workplace and we don’t use your data to inform ads targeting on Facebook. We do generate aggregated statistical and analytical data derived from your use of Workplace. Workplace only shares this data with Facebook in instances where it directly benefits our broader Workplace service, such as security or troubleshooting. We take protecting your data very seriously and have access controls, monitoring and employee training regimes designed to prevent unauthorized access to data by Facebook staff.Does Workplace share my data with third parties?As a Workplace customer you control and authorise which integrations can query data via our APIs, including vetted vendors from our integrations directory or custom integrations you may develop. Facebook has a robust third-party management framework that includes vendor assessment, security testing and periodic or random review to ensure alignment with our commitments to protect your data. Where Facebook retains subcontractors (or ‘subprocessors’) for services that may require access to Workplace personal or customer data, this will only be done with a written agreement that imposes on the subprocessor the same data protection obligations as are imposed on Facebook under the Workplace enterprise agreement. A list of applicable subprocessors can be provided on request.Speak to an expertGot more questions?
