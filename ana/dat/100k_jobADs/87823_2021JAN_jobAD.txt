Good to know for marketing, but very sad for OS developers.This is a very interesting point. Using a computer is an 'emotional' experience to most (mainly 'users', not 'programmers' etc) and Apple certainly did capitalise on this. But the same must be true in retrospect - otherwise why would we still be bothering with the CPC?Quote from: TFM/FS on 18:15, 11 October 11If you have some flashy, kinky and slow stuff, then people will buy it for any price.

For me the CPC is still the superior system. Just the most effective system, and ... I like it.However, when we have the first cpu's running with photons instead of electrons, then I will get a new computer ;-)LoggedTFM of FutureSoftAlso visit the CPC and Plus users favorite OS: FutureOS - The Revolution on CPC6128 and 6128PlusGryzorAdministrator6128 PlusPosts: 16.252Country:CPC-Wiki maintainerLiked: 3587Likes Given: 6493Re: In honour of Steve Jobs - first Apple experience/hardware?

Which is why Apple won't hear about opening OSX to normal PCs (even if they can run it) - if they do, they know they're kind of finished...Well didn't clones almost finish off apple previously?Personally OSX doesn't work for me whenever I have used it. I just dislike the integrated menu bar, the dock and despise floating windows in applications they just annoy me so pretty much I don't like anything about OSX essentially. Not that I've used it a whole lot but I doubt I could get over those issues or the complete lack of freedom which would be the real issue.I spose I could answer the original topic though,my first apple experience was in primary school on System 7 and I don't think I thought much of it really I didn't think it any better or worse then what I was used to with Windows 3.1 so I guess the experience was indifferent, the games were much more memorable then the OS itself, I really don't remember doing anything much resembling school work. Later on I didn't find MacOS8/9 any better in experience to Windows 95/98 either so I guess it wasn't a great experience it wasn't bad it just wasn't some magical experience that changed my view on life forever and that made me want to go buy overpriced shiny things.LoggedTotO6128 PlusPosts: 3.834Country:Liked: 2931Likes Given: 1767Re: In honour of Steve Jobs - first Apple experience/hardware?

Some people buy MacBook for running Windows7 on it. No OSX.It's their choices, they chose the hardware not the software. And then ?EDIT :Pretty Uninspired hardware ?
