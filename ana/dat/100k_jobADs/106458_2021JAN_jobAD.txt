BACKGROUND/RATIONALE:Meeting the global commitment to fulfilling every child’s right to water, sanitation and hygiene is an ongoing challenge at policy, administrative and community levels. Water is a public good and every person has the right to demand drinking water. It is the lifeline activity of the Government to ensure that this basic need of the people is met. Drinking Water has been the priority for Government of India and States from the beginning of independence. In 2009, the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programme has been modified as the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) with major emphasis on ensuring sustainability of water availability in terms of portability, adequacy, convenience, affordability and equity, while also adopting decentralized approach involving PRIs and community organizations. Again 2013 NRWDP guidelines were modified synchronizing with 12 five year plan giving more focus on piped water supply, increasing household tap connections and raising drinking water supply norms from 40 lpcd to 55 lpcd, greater thrust on coverage of water quality affected habitations with earmarked funding for chemical contamination besides, etc. Further, stressed on Water Security Plan, convergence with sanitation program and to move away from habitation to population. Recently GOI had issues Swajal guidelines to be implemented in all aspirational districts including 8 districts from three states. Its objective is to provide de-centralised, preferably solar energy based piped water supply in 117 aspirational districts through community designed, implemented, maintained and safely managed single village water supply scheme. The programme would also sustain the ODF status.All three states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana) have made significant progress in terms of provision of drinking water to all population including tribal population. Around 91.9% rural population in Andhra Pradesh, 95.1% in Karnataka and 91.9% in Telangana are using basic drinking water services. However, proportion of rural population using safely managed drinking water service is around 40% in all three states. Reducing microbial and chemical contamination of water sources on sustainable basis is a big challenge in many of the rural areas. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of reliable data on water quality. Though all three states have established laboratories at strategic locations and distributed Field Test Kits in all GPs but these are not used optimally to undertake water quality surveillance and monitoring due to limited capacities and resources in addition to poor coordination among relevant stakeholders. States have made limited efforts to incorporate Water Safety plans in the existing drinking water designs and implementation. Even local governments (GPs) have poor awareness on water safety plans. Though there is substantial allocation of budget for minimizing contamination of water sources, undertaking IEC on water quality issues, capacity building of key stakeholders including grassroots functionaries and PRIs, the progress is not that encouraging. Budget under these components is grossly under spent. There are no models on implementation of water safety plans in three states to learn from and replicate them. Similarly, there are no academic or resource organizations to impart trainings or expert support to governments especially on preparation and implementation of water safety plans and production of knowledge products for strengthening policy environment.Though many schools in the states have access to drinking water, they do not have information on quality of water supplied by different sources. As per HFODRR (Disaster Risk Reduction) strategy, around 48.82 million population in the three states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana) are vulnerable to cyclones, floods, droughts, heat-waves and hailstorms; the resultant increasing risk to communities of fatalities, severe damages to drinking water schemes and economic losses, especially on women and children, reverses the process of equity and growth. Communities and local institutions have limited knowledge and understanding on how to deal with challenges of safe water during the times of disasters.UNICEF support would include a professional to provide strategic technical assistance to relevant departments of state and target districts to develop and implement water safety plans and further strengthen water quality monitoring and surveillance system at institution and community level and also extend technical assistance to aspirational districts from three states on effective implementation of Swajal program.
