(John Carl D'Annibale / Times Union)John Carl D'AnnibaleShow MoreShow LessAlbanyA groundswell of goodwill and support continues to grow across the country for two local fired Wal-Mart workers, one terminated for redeeming $2 in abandoned cans and bottles and the other for waiting 30 minutes to return cash found in the store's parking lot.Times Union coverage of their stories sparked a social media storm and fueled national outrage that spawned a boycott, demonstrations, thousands of dollars in cash donations, job offers and possible legal action.Albany attorney Donald Boyajian will represent Thomas Smith, 52, of Albany, who was fired Nov. 6 from the East Greenbush store for redeeming the cans.\"He needs someone to help stand up for him against Wal-Mart. Their conduct was horrendous,\" Boyajian said Tuesday. He said the case was preliminary and that he had not yet formulated a plan of attack against the world's largest retailer.Boyajian represented Smith in 2002 after Smith robbed a KeyBank branch in Latham. Smith was on parole after serving more than 13 years of a 15-year sentence when Wal-Mart fired him for what they characterized as \"gross misconduct.\"Boyajian said Smith \"made a mistake and paid for it\" in the bank robbery. \"He never made excuses,\" Boyajian said. \"He always gave direct answers to my questions and he was not a baloney thrower.\" Boyajian decided to represent him in the Wal-Mart firing case after reading a Times Union article on the plight of Smith, who was homeless for several months after his release from prison in May.Meanwhile, Making Change at Wal-Mart UFCW, a national group backed by the 1.3 million-member United Food and Commercial Workers International, is planning a rally at a Capital Region Wal-Mart on Friday in support of Smith and Michael Walsh, 45, of Schenectady. After 18 years as a maintenance worker, Walsh also was fired on Nov. 6 from the Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market in Niskayuna after he waited 30 minutes to turn in $350 he found in the parking lot.The union is organizing 200 rallies at Wal-Mart stores around the nation during the holiday shopping season. Wal-Mart employs 1.4 million people at 5,200 stores. The union's campaign \"Are You With Us?\" includes TV commercials and a social media push. The union has tried unsuccessfully for decades to unionize Wal-Mart workers.\"We're rallying against low wages, cut hours, unfair firings, mistreatment and disrespect against Wal-Mart workers,\" said Jess Levin, communications director for Making Change at Wal-Mart UFCW. \"We're showcasing the difficulties faced by current and former Wal-Mart workers.\"\"We don't have anything additional to add at this time,\" said Aaron Mullins, a Wal-Mart spokesman.\"Wal-Mart is in a league of its own in terms of mistreating employees,\" Levin said.Smith met Tuesday with state Department of Labor officials after Assembly members Steve McLaughlin, a Republican from Schaghticoke, and John McDonald, D-Cohoes, co-authored a letter to the Labor Department's acting commissioner, Mario Musolino, asking for a state investigation into Smith's firing.\"I'm going to continue to fight,\" Smith said. \"Wal-Mart has been spreading a lot of lies about me. Their day's coming in court.\"Smith is pleased with his new job at DJM Property Maintenance Group, which he started last week. He earns $12 an hour, a $3 hourly increase from Wal-Mart job.\"The job is good and I like my boss,\" Smith said. He will receive $22,150 donated from 995 people at a GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign started by Donya Hamdan of Chicago.The other fired Wal-Mart worker, Walsh, of Schenectady, interviewed last week with GForce Janitorial of Clifton Park and anticipates a job offer. \" I look forward to it. I need a job,\" said Walsh, whose wife is on disability.\"He's a great guy and he'd be a great addition to our team,\" said Michael Meleco, owner of the 30-employee janitorial service. He hopes to place Walsh with an Albany cleaning team.\"He worked at Wal-Mart for 18 years, which is the kind of loyal employee I'm looking to hire,\" Meleco said. \"It's hard to find workers with that kind of reliability.\" His pay rate starts at $11 an hour, but Meleco said he'd consider bumping Walsh up to $14 an hour, equal to his Wal-Mart pay, if he also mopped and waxed floors.A boycott of the Wal-Mart East Greenbush store continues through Jan. 1, led by a coalition of local labor and religion groups.\"We're getting a lot of support for the boycott,\" said Alice Green, founder of the Center for Law and Justice.pgrondahl@timesunion.com • 518-454-5623 • @PaulGrondahlWritten ByPaul GrondahlPaul Grondahl is a former staff writer at the Times Union, where he worked from 1984 to 2017 and won numerous local, state and national writing prizes for in-depth projects.
