I want people who are much brighter than me who can work in an extreme environment. If you play office politics, you will be discovered and immediately binned.'Mr Cummings also wants communications and policy experts, criticising the Whitehall practice of employing generalists who frequently move jobs.'With no election for years and huge changes in the digital world, there is a chance and a need to do things very differently,' he says.'We also are interested in people who have worked in movies or on advertising campaigns.'The final category of jobs is 'super-talented weirdos', although Mr Cummings admits he 'doesn't really know what I'm looking for'.'People in SW1 talk a lot about diversity but they rarely mean true cognitive diversity,' Mr Cummings writes.'They are usually babbling about 'gender identity diversity blah blah'.'What SW1 needs is not more drivel about 'identity' and 'diversity' from Oxbridge humanities graduates but more genuine cognitive diversity.'If you want to figure out what characters around Putin might do, or how international criminal gangs might exploit holes in our border security, you don’t want more Oxbridge English graduates who chat about Lacan at dinner parties with TV producers and spread fake news about fake news.'Plans: The advert is a direct challenge to the civil service and Whitehall establishment which Mr Cummings has long criticised and which Boris Johnson (pictured) plans to reformHe goes on: 'We need some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole.'By definition I don't really know what I'm looking for but I want people around No10 to be on the lookout for such people.'We need to figure out how to use such people better without asking them to conform to the horrors of 'Human Resources' (which also obviously need a bonfire).'Mr Cummings will be one of the interviewers himself, he says. Applicants must be able to commit for at least two years.Prospective candidates are told to send their applications to a Gmail address rather than an official government email account.In a typically rambling post, he also mentions the Apollo missions, quotes from military strategists and cites academic papers about war and statistics.Mr Cummings was appointed by Mr Johnson when he became PM in July 2019 and will now wield substantial power following the Tories' emphatic election win.Mark Serwotka, the head of the civil service union PCS, has already vowed to resist plans for a major overhaul of Whitehall.'The major problem for the civil service in the last decade has been under investment, real terms pay cuts and poor government policy,' he said.'Comments by Dominic Cummings that imply he wants to hire and fire at will reveal an anti-trade union mentality and will be strenuously resisted by PCS.'Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA which represents senior civil servants, has also warned that the PM's allies are exhibiting a 'fundamental misunderstanding' of the modern civil service.AdvertisementShare or comment on this article:Boris Johnson's top aide Dominic Cummings posts bizarre job adverte-mail249sharesMost watched News videosPakistan Navy sinks old British ship in torpedoes exercicePolice escort woman from Sainbury's for refusing to wear a maskNavalny: 'Criminal procedures' code has been blatantly torn up'UK vaccines minister guarantees second doses within twelve weeksGypsy Wedding star Paddy Doherty sends message from hospitalBengal Tiger bites off safari car's bumper in southern IndiaMatt Hancock spotted out in Queen's Park amidst Covid lockdownShocking moment hooded burglars trying to kick down front doorsRaab touts vaccine success & promises escape from lockdown by Spring'I'm someone's daughter': Deborah James on life value rowSeafood trucks descend on Parliament in Brexit export protestFlorida woman arrested for refusing to wear mask inside restaurantComments 1342Share what you thinkNewestOldestBest ratedWorst ratedView allThe comments below have not been moderated.View allThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.We are no longer accepting comments on this article.More top storiesBingSite Web Enter search term:SearchAdvertisementLike DailyMailFollow DailyMailFollow @dailymailFollow DailyMailFollow MailOnlineFollow Daily MailFemail TodayShock split!
