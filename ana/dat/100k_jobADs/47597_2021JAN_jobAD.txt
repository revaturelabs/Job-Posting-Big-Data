To render possible assistance to those in need inside the country and to mitigate the sufferings of the displaced Afghans in the neighboring countries, some Afghan NGOs were established and with the direct support of the donor agencies they have done a good job in assisting the needy ones since their inception. Just for Afghan Capacity and Knowledge (JACK) is an independent, non-governmental, non-profit, non-political and non-sectarian organization (Afghan National NGO), created at the initiative of a group of Afghan Professionals in 2001.
