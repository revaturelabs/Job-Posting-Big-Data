VAG lacked the technology, infrastructure, machinery and resources to operate, manage and regulate lotteries, and therefore, was depending on third parties who were abusing the lottery regulations and impoverishing the veterans.The licence issued by VAG to private lotto operators and agents came to an end on November 2018, it added“It is important to state that, only duly licensed lotto marketing companies and private lotto operators and agents would be allowed to participate in the VAG Lotto strictly in accordance with the terms and conditions as contained in their respective licences,” it said.The statement indicated that necessary actions would be taken by the Authority to clamp down on all unlicensed lotto operators and agents across the country.By Times ReporterShow MoreShareFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest WhatsApp	Allegation seeking to indict President in purchase of properties for embassy in Oslo dismissed.﻿Immigration officers at KIA undergo training in fake travel document detectionRelated ArticlesFocus more on agric sector investment to improve economy – Dr SarkodieJanuary 19, 2021UWR GES undertakes ‘Back-to-sch’ sensitisation programmeJanuary 19, 2021C/R FDA destroys unwholesome food, other productsJanuary 19, 2021Cooperation, dialogue must guide Parliament–BagbinJanuary 19, 2021Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
