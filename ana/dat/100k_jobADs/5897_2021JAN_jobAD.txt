Here’s What You should do:Remote Jobs WebsitesFAQsEven before Covid-19 reared its ugly head and crippled the planet, remote work, either full-time or part-time, had gone from a rare privilege to a very common practise.According to a recent report by a leading specialist recruitment firm in Singapore, 8 out of 10 employers have no problem with their staff working from home.Benefits of Working from HomeThe benefits of working from home are pretty obvious. After many years of commuting to work, many 9-to-5 employees are looking forward to a healthy change where they can earn their living at the comfort of their home.Let’s zone into some of these benefits:For an EmployeeWork-life balanceThe most obvious benefit of working from home is the work-life balance. Work-life balance has so many interpretations, but basically, it’s about doing less work and having more time for yourself.No CommuteEver thought about the amount of time you waste on the road going to work? On average, 9 to 5 employees waste about 26 minutes going to work (and that’s for one direction only).Better healthYou’re more likely to embrace a healthy living when you work from home. You can cook your lunch instead of relying on junk food or a nearby cafeteria. You’ll also have enough time to enforce a daily workout routine.Flexible Work hoursFlexible work schedules are becoming a common trend in Singapore. Almost every industry has a remote work option with a flexible work schedule.More ConvenientAnother common reason some people choose to work remotely is to cut off any form of contact with annoying co-workers. Working from home also allows you to take in a second job as a side hustle or to try out a new job.The Financial BenefitsThe financial benefits of working from home are rife. The first one is the reduction in tax deductions. You can also call up the company and claim the expenses you’d have saved the company from incurring. Lastly is the amount of money you’ll end up saving on public transport or fuel.For EmployersEmployees aren’t the only ones to benefit from this arrangement. Here are a few ways employers are also likely to benefit:Bigger Talent PoolAs an employer, you’re not just limited to a work staff that’s within walking distance to where your company or business is located. You can pick candidates who are hundreds or thousands of miles away, without making them relocate or anything. All you have to do instead is allow them to work remotely.More Cost-effectiveWith remote workers, you don’t have to set up an office. Nor will you be sorting out rent, internet, taxes, stationery, and so forth. You’ll have an easy time understanding this if you’ve ever run a functional office. There are monthly expenses to be incurred, and nothing about it is cheap.More ProductivityThe biggest misconception many employers have is that employees will slack off when you make them work remotely. But research seems to suggest otherwise. According to a recent study finding, employees are likely to be more productive when they’re working on their own terms and schedule.The Downside of Working from HomeOf course, there are a few downsides to this whole idea. We’ll list a few here:You won’t be taken SeriouslyThat’s the reality on the ground. People won’t take you seriously if you’re always at home claiming to work. So, expect them to think you have more time on your hands to perform other errands, do house chores, and take care of a long -list of other non-work-related tasks.Dealing with distractionsThis is perhaps the biggest problem with working remotely. It’s even worse when you have children at home or when you aren’t much of a disciplined person. You have to deal with people who show up at your place unannounced. Not to mention, the usual culprits – internet, television, and social media.The lonelinessWorking from an office means you have other co-workers to talk to and seek their assistance in case you get stuck. You have the benefit of social interaction. One common effect of this is people neglecting their health. Learn to take regular breaks, instead of working all through.Essential Tools You Might Need While Working from HomeYou don’t necessarily need these tools. But they may come in handy at some point as you begin working from home.Here are the tools:REMOTE DESKTOPSYou want to work on a slide deck, and then you remember that you didn’t bring your visual assets from the office. What do you do? Well, with a remote desktop app, you don’t have to worry about going back to the office. Your computer can be accessed remotely, no matter the distance.TeamviewerThe best thing about Teamviewer is that it’s free. It also runs on almost any operating system you can think of, including OS X, Linux, Windows, and Android. It’s a great tool for file transfers, clipboard transfers, and wake-on-LAN. No need for port forwarding. Nor do you require firewall futzing to get it up and running.SplashtopSplashtop can make a good alternative to Teamviewer. It supports low-latency transfers, and it’s the closest thing to operating a computer when you’re many miles away. Its personal version is also free. Also, like Teamviewer, it supports screen-sharing, which may come in handy where you need to walk someone through anything technical.Microsoft Remote Desktop or Apple Remote DesktopThese two sister applications allow you to manage another computer remotely. You can use them to transfer files and even update software. The only difference is that Microsoft Remote Desktop has a slightly limited remote access. Also, while the RDC is free, ARD goes for $80.TelepresenceTelepresence is more of a trend that’s fast picking up shape than it’s a tool. It’s a technology that uses table-top devices and robots to embody employees. A few telepresence machines are about to revolutionise the telepresence landscape. They include:DoubleDouble is a telepresence Segway for iPads, currently going for about $2500. Being physically embodied encourages a more authentic interpersonal connection. It also generates random interactions that try to simulate in-office workforce interactions.Meeting OwlMeeting Owl is a video conferencing tool that automatically focuses on the person speaking during a conference. It offers a 360 degrees camera view to give a panoramic view of a meeting and all of its attendants to remote viewers.REALTIME COMMUNICATIONSSlack: good for real-time group chat. Not every conversation or request has to be made via email or phone. You can DM individual members of your team and converse in real-time. It’s even better with this tool because it can integrate with Google docs and DropBox.Mattermost: Mattermost is one of the closest alternatives to Slack. The tool emulates many of Slack’s functionalities. Rocket Chat also offers similar functionalities, but with a leaning towards video conferencing.Microsoft Teams: Teams is a full-service communication and collaboration suite for Windows. It’s part of the premium Office 365 subscription. You can direct message users, send group messages, make VOIP and video calls, and share work with other 365 apps, including Excel and PowerPoint.Slack AlternativesIf you don’t feel like using Slack, here are a few examples of slack alternatives you can use: Glip, Fleep, Flock, Twist, and Ryver.VIDEO CHAT TOOLSZoomGreat tool for organising team meetings with lots of remote workers. The free version caps at 40 minutes, which makes it a great idea to upgrade to Zoom Professional for $14.99. Google hangout makes a great alternative, especially since it’s free.Skype for BusinessSkype is another great slack alternative, especially with their slack clone teams. Both skype and Teams are included in the Office 365 Premium bundle, which goes for $12.50 per month.Join.meNo app. No plugin or anything. Join.me is cloud-based and thrives on simplicity. They have a cool whiteboarding feature that you can use to write down your ideas and share them around during chats. It’s a great tool for brainstorming and jotting down your ideas.PROJECT MANAGEMENTBasecampBasecamp’s core functions include messaging, collaboration, task management, file sharing, reporting, scheduling, and universal search function. It goes for about $99 per year for unlimited users.MondayMonday is a fast-rising project management tool, the closest alternative to Basecamp. This visually stunning, Kanban-based project management tool is targeted for both small and medium-sized teams and has labels to determine which member of the team is working on a particular part of a project and when.AsanaAsana is a workflow and task management tool. It also doubles as a project management tool, thanks to its new timeline feature. Essentially, it allows different members of a team to assign sub-tasks and tasks while also tracking projects.TrelloTrello is one of the simplest and easy-to-figure out project management tools you’ll ever come across. It’s built to simulate the functionality of bulletin boards, with each board representing a project you’re working on.TIME MANAGEMENTTimelyTimely goes beyond helping you track time. You can use it to schedule tasks and track the time you spent on projects in real-time.TogglGreat tool for tracking every minute of your time. What have you been doing the whole day? It’s a great tool for tracking your productivity.EverhourEverhour is a great tool for tracking team members. It can also sync with a long list of other productivity tools you’re already using. It also has a timer function that you can use to track billable hours or the amount of time it takes to complete a particular project.Important Tips on How to Search for Work-from-Home Job Opportunities in SingaporeFinding legitimate work-from-home job opportunities isn’t a matter of chance. You have to research everything and take necessary precautions to avoid falling victim to some of the scams out there.Here’s how you find legitimate remote work opportunities, while protecting yourself from getting scammed:Trust Your Gut, especially when the Deal Sounds so GoodAll manner of scoundrels swamps the internet. But the most common ones are the strangers that send you an email or pop-up on your social media timeline with promises of giving you a job that pays a large salary. It’s always best to leave these emails unanswered.Avoid “Clickbait-y” AdsBe wary of the get-rich-quick schemes that promise you heaven when all they’re after is your hard-earned sweat. Ads that promise to turn you into a millionaire overnight, without being clear on what they want from you are definitely a scam.Never Enter Your Personal Payment Information, anywhereBe careful with whom you disclose your credit card information to. No employer should ask you to disclose this information. Take it as a red flag whenever a potential employer pushes you to reveal your bank information.Research the Company or Organisation You’re Trying to Secure a Job withBefore you apply with any organisation or company, take your time to research them and make sure they’re legitimate enough to be trusted with your time. Check their website and employee-written reviews and make sure the company is legitimate before you can go ahead and submit your application.Use Reliable Job Seeking SitesAlways go with a well-established website you already know off, such as LinkedIn, Upwork, Freelancer, Glassdoor, Seek, and Jora. This comes with no guarantees, either. But there are reduced chances of getting scammed since most of these job boards require payments to list jobs, which many scammers are never willing to do.How to Create a Conducive Work from Home EnvironmentYou need a dedicated workspace in your home, and here are a few tips on how to set it up:Have a dedicated Room or SpaceYou can’t work from your living room, bedroom, or kitchen. You need office space, something that generates a feeling of physical separation from your personal life. The space you choose should give you a sense of going to work. The best idea would be to choose a separate room and set it up like an office.Clear all the ClutterPart of repurposing the room is eliminating all the non-work-related stuff in the room. Get rid of unnecessary furniture, decoration, stationery, or any other item that affects your productivity or makes the room less conducive for work.Get Proper EquipmentMake sure you have all the equipment you’ll need to do your job. You can start by getting stationary, including a chair and a desk. Remember to also invest in a good PC, scanner, headset, and so on. Essentially, come up with a list of all the things your job needs and be sure to acquire them before you start working.Jazz it UpYour workspace shouldn’t be all dull and boring. You want to make sure everything is all fun and jazzed up. Get some nice photos, houseplants, and anything else you suspect may make your work environment more appealing. The point is to steer clear of anything distractive.You don’t really have to Work from HomeWorking from home doesn’t necessarily mean working within the confines of your home compound. You can pick up your laptop and visit a local coffee shop, coworking space, or library and work from there.Qualities of a Successful Remote WorkerHere are a few defining character traits of a successful remote worker:Introverts: Working from home arrangement is more attractive to introverts.
