Wrinkles, grey hair, personal or intellectual growth are frowned upon. I don’t want my job to be identified by my gender,” she added.Kangana went on to say that her most memorable ‘pangas’ are with the film industry people. “You know how charming and pleasing they are in front of you, then plan, plot and stab you behind your back. You have to be alert at all times,” she cautioned. Talking about the ongoing protests in the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act, Kangana said that violence should never be a resort. “In our country only three-four per cent of the population pay taxes, so what gives you the right to destroy public property,” she said adding that no one should be a sore loser in a democracy. When prompted that her co-star in the film Richa Chadha has polarising political views than hers, Kangana jumped in saying it’s good to have different views but they had a lot to talk about other than that while working together.Untitled CarouselPanga trailer: Kangana Ranaut portrays an inspiring story of a strong kabaddi playerThe much-awaited trailer of Kangana Ranaut's Panga released on Monday.
