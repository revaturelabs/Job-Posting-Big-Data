Although construction jobs may be commonly associated with being dangerous, construction companies are required to adhere to strict safety requirements. One recent incident at one of Chicago’s high-rise buildings shows just how tragic construction-related accidents can be.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has launched an investigation after a construction worker recently died on the job, during the construction of a residential building on Elm Street. According to reports, the construction worker, who was 45 years old, was inside a crane about six stories high at the time of the accident. The worker was allegedly leaning into an area where an elevator descended and pinned him. Other workers were able to free the man before emergency crews assisted in lowering him to street level. According to the Chicago Fire Department chief, when the man was found pinned by the elevator and the crane, he was unresponsive.The victim was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital with upper body injuries – in critical condition. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital. A spokesman for the Chicago Fire Department said that there was not much that could be done to save the victim, because his injuries were so traumatic.If OSHA uncovers any safety violations that may have contributed to the accident, the construction company may be issued citations. In addition, the family members of the victim may also have the option to file a personal injury lawsuit – depending on the results of the investigation.Source: The Chicago Tribune, “OSHA to investigate after worker, 45, crushed in construction accident,” Tom Palmer and Rosemary Regina Sobol, Jan. 30, 2015FacebookTwitterLinkedInCategoriesBirth Injuries (3)Birth Injuries (12)Car Accidents (3)Chicago Personal Injury Blog (3)Chicago Personal Injury Blog (1)Chicago Personal Injury Blog (1)Construction Accidents (10)Elder Abuse (13)Firm News (15)Injuries (18)Medical Malpractice (77)Motor Vehicle Accidents (35)Nursing Home Abuse And Neglect (27)Nursing Home Neglect Or Abuse (10)Premises Liability (1)Uncategorized (1)ArchivesArchives Select Month January 2021 (2) December 2020 (6) November 2020 (5) October 2020 (8) September 2020 (6) August 2020 (8) July 2020 (8) June 2020 (6) May 2020 (7) April 2020 (4) March 2020 (4) February 2020 (6) January 2020 (4) December 2019 (6) November 2019 (4) October 2019 (6) September 2019 (5) August 2019 (5) July 2019 (5) June 2019 (5) May 2019 (5) April 2019 (5) March 2019 (5) February 2019 (4) January 2019 (5) December 2018 (5) November 2018 (5) October 2018 (5) September 2018 (5) August 2018 (5) July 2018 (4) June 2018 (6) May 2018 (5) April 2018 (5) March 2018 (5) February 2018 (5) January 2018 (4) December 2017 (5) November 2017 (3) September 2017 (4) August 2017 (5) July 2017 (5) June 2017 (4) May 2017 (3) April 2017 (5) March 2017 (5) February 2017 (4) January 2017 (3) December 2016 (5) November 2016 (6) October 2016 (3) September 2016 (6) August 2016 (4) July 2016 (6) June 2016 (4) May 2016 (6) April 2016 (7) March 2016 (9) February 2016 (7) January 2016 (6) December 2015 (8) November 2015 (7) October 2015 (8) September 2015 (7) August 2015 (9) July 2015 (11) June 2015 (9) May 2015 (11) April 2015 (10) March 2015 (10) February 2015 (10) January 2015 (10) December 2014 (11) November 2014 (11) October 2014 (10) September 2014 (9) August 2014 (7) July 2014 (6) June 2014 (9) May 2014 (9) April 2014 (10) March 2014 (7) February 2014 (4) January 2014 (4) December 2013 (6) November 2013 (5) October 2013 (4) September 2013 (4) August 2013 (4) July 2013 (4) June 2013 (4) May 2013 (5) April 2013 (4) March 2013 (4) February 2013 (4) January 2013 (4) December 2012 (5) November 2012 (4) October 2012 (5) September 2012 (4) August 2012 (5) July 2012 (4) June 2012 (5) May 2012 (4) April 2012 (4) March 2012 (1)Recent PostsWhat are the different types of cerebral palsy?Is surgical mesh safe?The changing face of product liabilityThe Long-Term Effects of Mild Brain InjuriesThis Fungus Is Deadlier Than COVID-19 and It Is Invading Nursing HomesSubscribe To This Blog’s FeedRecent Case Results$2,300,000 – Brain Injury$650,000 – Motor Vehicle Accident$800,000 – Construction Injury$570,000 – Medical Malpractice$4,300,000 – Medical Malpractice$4,100,000 – Construction$4,000,000 – Medical Malpractice$3,000,000 – Vehicle Accident$950,000 – Birth Injury Malpractice$5,860,000 Medical Malpractice – Wrongful Death$1,800,000 – Product Liability$4,000,000 – Medical Malpractice$3,000,000 – Vehicle Accident$950,000 – Birth Injury Malpractice$7,500,000 – Premises LiabilityWatch Our Videos:Learn about our firm and how our expertise in personal injury cases will ensure that you receive the best possible outcome to your case.Win A $1,000Scholarship AwardSubmit a 1,500 words or less topic-specific essay by July 15, 2020 via this website for a chance to win a $1,000 scholarship from Steinberg, Goodman & Kalish.Click Here for more submission details on how to win.Get The Settlement That You DeserveTell us about your case and we’ll get back to you with a FREE case evaluation.Schedule Your FREE ConsultationSGKSteinberg, Goodman & KalishPersonal Injury & Medical Malpractice Attorneys | Chicago, ILFollowFollowFollowOffice Location20 North Clark Street 31st FloorChicago, IL 60602Chicago Law Office MapContact UsPhone: 312-818-3704Fax: 312-782-6739© 2021 Steinberg, Goodman & Kalish.
