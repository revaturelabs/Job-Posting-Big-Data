The number and size of fines for anti-money laundering (AML) and financial crime compliance (FCC) breaches is increasing, and money launderers and criminals are exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to ramp up attacks on firms.The MLRO is a senior figure who will represent your firm. This requires the FCA's 'fit and proper person' approval: CF11 under the outgoing regime, SMF17 under SMCR. This means that a good MLRO must behave in a way that is appropriate to their position.Purpose of the roleThe main focus of the MLRO role usually is to establish and effective compliance culture within a firm for fighting against money laundering, terrorist financial, and other forms of financial crime. Because of the role's high importance, a MLRO must build strong relationships with key stakeholders, senior management and a company's board to ensure they are fully aware of all anti-money laundering matters.​Key RequirementsThe MLRO's knowledge must include the technical side of reporting and record-keeping requirements like Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) suspicious transaction and order reports (STORs) and National Crime Agency suspicious activity reports (SARs).A new MLRO needs sufficient experience to overhaul protocols and procedures to reduce the risk of breaches and avoid fines.They must also know how to manage a team. That includes knowing how to delegate and how to develop talented subordinates.Money launderers are always seeking new channels to exploit. An MLRO must not just know launderers’ latest methods, but have a keen sense of what might be a new ruse. That said, they must be pragmatic and keep a sense of proportion. They should not immediately ‘red flag’ every little thing.​Usual ResponsibilitiesComply at all times with the Statements and Code of Practice for Approved PersonsImplement Anti-Money Laundering and counter-terrorist financing policies aligned with evolving regulatory obligationsOversee all aspects of Financial Crime related regulation, policies, procedures and controlsDaily management of all financial crime prevention efforts.
