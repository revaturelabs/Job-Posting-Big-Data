Some had dates, some did not. I still have God awful memories of trudging up old topics in past forums, so I figured let's start fresh with a general catch-all thread for Halloween that can carry over year-after-year.Things can be discussed such as good movies for the season, or how to set up a proper haunted house, excellent locations for haunted hayrides or corn mazes, and, of course, costume concepts and ideas.Myself, I'm currently working on a costume as The Penguin from Batman.I ordered a toy umbrella gun (that is hopefully fake looking enough that I won't get arrested but I'll probably keep it hidden just in case), but since it's an import it might not arrive in time. In which case, I'll just use a standard umbrella.I bought a cheap top hat, bow tie and cigarette holder from a Halloween store and have added a monocle to my shopping cart on Amazon (what kind of Halloween store lacks a prop monocle? All of them, it seems).I just need to figure out where I can get a cheap tailcoat, suspenders and/or cumberbun, and pin stripe pants. I'm guessing I should try outlets or Goodwill first.But the real trouble is the nose. Based on my Amazon search, my best options are this goofy looking thing, this larger and rounded shnozzer, and this Tim Burtonesque crooked beak of a nose. Just about any other nose at a Halloween store has a wart or mole to make it look more witch like.I'm planning on some Halloween shenanigans in the Southeastern PA or South Jersey area, such as haunted houses or corn mazes, that I'll be posting here.What are you guys doing for the holiday?YouTube | Twitch | BlogSW-3864-9679-7572Baron Of HellPosted: October 17, 10:28 AMPermalinkEvil is Good, Good is DumbSeattleBaron Of Hell wrote:Baron Of Hell wrote:Watched Tanny and the T-rex and it was bad but entertaining. It is a movie from the early 90s staring Denise Richards. A kid gets his brain put into a robotic T-rex. The T-rex goes around killing the people that wronged him when he was human. He also kills a bunch of people that didn't wrong him for some odd reason. So the wacky thing about this movie is the kid seems to be in complete control of his new t-rex body. There are silly things where we have a t-rex making phone calls and playing hand games. Really dumb stuff that is kind of funny.The only bad thing was a few unnecessary gay jokes. Got to get in those guy jokes in 90 movies I guess.Oh I don't know what the deal is with the name. The movie is called is Tanny and the t-rex but is sold as Tammy and T-Rex, Did they spell her name wrong? There is a robotic dinosaur so you probably wont care.Also note there are two versions of this movie. A PG version and a unrated gore version.3DS: Baron 0473-7792-9272PS3 Tag: Baron-Of-Hell Steam:Baron_Of_Hell TWITTER:BaronOfHellBaron Of HellPosted: October 18, 11:10 AMPermalinkEvil is Good, Good is DumbSeattleWatched Black Box and didn't care for it much. The movie took a long time to get to good part. This should have been a hour long black mirror episode.The movie is about a guy that lost his memory in a car accident. Not only that he is having a hard time keeping new memories. He takes part in a experimental program to get his memory backs. Things go wrong. Monsters plague his dreams. His daughter is getting scared. Bill Cosby's wife is screaming about he never showed her his pudding pop.The basic story is fine it just takes to long to set up. It will be over a hour before the situation is clear. This could have been done in 15 minutes or at most 30 minutes. Once you are done with the movie you will realize back mirror did this already and did it better in less time.This was one of the blumhouse movies on amazon. Most seem to be getting bad reviews. Even though I didn't like the movie I'm still glad I watched it. I was at least entertain by the last half hour. I think if you watch this and find yourself getting ready to drop it skip to a hour into it and continue from there.3DS: Baron 0473-7792-9272PS3 Tag: Baron-Of-Hell Steam:Baron_Of_Hell TWITTER:BaronOfHellBaron Of HellPosted: October 18, 2:30 PMPermalinkEvil is Good, Good is DumbSeattleWatched the first episode of Helstrom on Hulu and liked it. The series is dead even if it turns out great. Show is about a skinny giant lady that teams up with her brother to stop the demon that is possessing their mom. Based on a comic that dealt with marvels demonic magical stuff.Interestingly the nun lady played the top demon on Shadow Hunters. Everybody is from some other show.

The only reason it is out now is because it was mostly done before they bought marvel. If they had continue with the Ghost Rider show then the show would have had a chance. This isn't the type of marvel show they want even if it does great.

The first thing that got me were the actors. We got Star Trek guy, a gotham guy, a agent of shield guy, a porn actress (don't ask me how I know that) and all did a good job. The star trek guy I only recognized by his iconic voice. He is usually in a ton of makeup so seeing him as just a human was a surprise.This is a trap people in game of life and death for S and giggles or whatever. I seen a bunch of these movies and liked most of them. This doesn't improve on the genre any but it was still good. Hide and Seek is a much better movie with a similar idea. Also that movie is really funny. This one doesn't have any laughs and no real gore. However, I don't think it needed gore. I still felt dread over most of the situations.What I would have liked is maybe some more character setup. I have no idea why a few people were there. Penguin just kind of vanishes for no reason. Maybe batman came for him. Also would have liked a reason for the game but not given a reason is a trope for this kind of movie.Anyway good Halloween movie.3DS: Baron 0473-7792-9272PS3 Tag: Baron-Of-Hell Steam:Baron_Of_Hell TWITTER:BaronOfHellBaron Of HellPosted: October 19, 10:18 AMPermalinkEvil is Good, Good is DumbSeattleBaron Of Hell wrote:Watched Would you Rather and liked it.

I put this one off because of the nazis. On the plus side they get slaughtered so it isn't all bad. Lots of gore from gunshots and knives. Very tense movie. No idea why it is called Green Room. None of the rooms were green. I don't recall anyone saying green room in the movie. I did start the movie at 3 am so I might not have been in my right mind. Think I had two screwdrivers and a chaos so my judgement might be off. Kind of want to watch it again. The saddest part was the doggy at the end. I don't blame the poor doggy for being own by racists. Picard was really good in this. Odd seeing him outside of sci fi show.I give this 9 dead nazis out of 10.

I thought it was on par with the original movie. Maybe a little less dark and witches weren't as scary. Or maybe the dark moments were different. The story beats are the same witches want to kill kids, after being turned into mice the kids mount a counter attack, high jinxes happen and the day is saved or is it?I give it 7 and a half kids turned to mice out of ten.3DS: Baron 0473-7792-9272PS3 Tag: Baron-Of-Hell Steam:Baron_Of_Hell TWITTER:BaronOfHellBaron Of HellPosted: October 25, 4:33 AMPermalinkEvil is Good, Good is DumbSeattlewhispa wrote:Enjoyed Green Room very much but yes, it was disturbing.Looking to maybe watch The Conjuring and Sinister this weekend.

The Crow is also another one I am trying to get my wife to watch.This reminded me that I hadn't watched Sinister so that is what I watched. Started watching two by mistake which might have spoiled me a bit on one. Anyway I liked the movie, it is about a writer that finds snuff movies. Some weird scary clown stuff starts happening that screws with his life. Lots of jump scares and tension in this one.Some say it is scariest thing ever. I don't know about that but it did have my heart racing or maybe that is the diabetes. I give it 8.5 8mm films filled with murder victims and clowns.There will be one burning question at the end of the movie. What happen to the dog? Oh why didn't he take the bat? Okay no one will asks those questions. Probably be to busy trying to figure out who is making snuff movies. Well sir I worry about the dogs and bats. Not animal bats the wooden kind. This movie could have been a 9 if he picked up that bat. 9.5 if we found out what happen with the dog. Might actually missed what happen to the dog. Clown could have got him. Maybe the clown got the bat also when I looked away.

I liked the beginning more than the ending. Ends on a cliffhanger.Watched the first 3 episodes of Another. I didn't know anything about the anime before going in. I did recognize eye-patch girl from cosplay, toys, and fan sites. Didn't know where she was from until now. No idea what is going on. My first guess was everyone is dead. Then there was a umbrella incident that made me change my mind maybe. They could still be dead but maybe in hell or someone's dream. Or maybe eye-patch is death. Or maybe umbrellas are just dangerous. Then they got something going on with dolls. The show keeps cutting to them. Oh maybe everyone that dies become a doll. Or maybe the creator of this show just like dolls. Now that I think about it the main character starts off in a hospital. He probably died and now he is stuck in hell or the afterlife or something like that. Oh maybe they are doing the VR thing. He is stuck in a VR world and doesn't know. So many possibilities which one will it be.3DS: Baron 0473-7792-9272PS3 Tag: Baron-Of-Hell Steam:Baron_Of_Hell TWITTER:BaronOfHellBaron Of HellPosted: October 30, 10:44 AMPermalinkEvil is Good, Good is DumbSeattleRead Lovecraft Country and liked it.

Everything coming out of Blumhouse is hot trash as of late. Fans of the first movie are going to hate this movie. This movie is nowhere near as dark, sexy, cool or fun. This movie takes a completely different tone. They shouldn't not have called this The Craft. If they didn't want to make the craft why put it in the title.There are four girls that form a coven. Sounds like the craft. Nope, these girls are diverse. Hey they had a black girl in the original movie. No that was token black. This movie has a non token black girl, a trans girl, a boyish girl, and a latin girl. Also of these girls were just there and not tokens. This was one of the good things in the movie. The bad thing is we only got to know one of the girls. so they weren't tokens but they were props for the main girl. In fact everyone was a prop for the main girl. Even the bad guy was a afterthought with minor motivations.The movie is very tame. They made a PG sequel to a R movie. Why do that? Maybe they wanted a more positive view on magic but they could have gone darker with people going against them. I seen darker episodes of Buffy the vampire slayer. Maybe they are aiming for preteens.I liked the start. The middle gets muddled. The end comes fast and isn't good because of the lack of consequences. Also they didn't show how they got a important thing back. Bad editing or bad story telling.I give it four witches out of ten.3DS: Baron 0473-7792-9272PS3 Tag: Baron-Of-Hell Steam:Baron_Of_Hell TWITTER:BaronOfHellPages« first‹ previous12345678next ›last »You are hereHome » Forums » Everything Else"
