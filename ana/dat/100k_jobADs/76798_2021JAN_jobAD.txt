"Almost 50% of furloughed jobs in the Tees Valley are ‘at risk’ - Alex Cunningham MPSkip to contentAlex Cunningham MPHomeCovid 19AboutCampaignsNewsSurgeriesGet in touchSearch for:Menu CloseHomeCovid 19AboutCampaignsNewsSurgeriesGet in touchBlogHome>2020>September>News>Almost 50% of furloughed jobs in the Tees Valley are ‘at risk’Almost 50% of furloughed jobs in the Tees Valley are ‘at risk’Post author:Stockton North Labour TeamPost published:September 17, 2020Post category:NewsAlex Cunningham condemns government for putting thousands of North East jobs at risk.Latest figures suggest 350,700 jobs in the North East are still fully furloughed – including 81,300 here in the Tees Valley. Of those furloughed roles in the Tees Valley, 36,300, or 45%, are deemed to be at risk when the scheme is pulled at the end of next month.The Labour Party has pledged to do everything it can to save jobs as the furlough cliff-edge approaches. There are still many parts of the UK economy unable to open at all with many businesses in the hardest hit sectors unable to operate at full capacity. With Covid-19 cases on the rise again, it’s unlikely this will change in just 5 weeks time. Removing the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme now means thousands of workers across the region will see support removed before it is possible for them to return to work.Alex is calling on the government to extend and review the scheme and provide targeted support to those who need it.This latest information has come hard on the heels of the news that 12500 people more across the Tees Valley are now claiming unemployment related benefits.Concerned about the disastrous consequences for residents in Stockton North, Alex says:“If the Government is serious about levelling up, they should be offering proper job protection to people constituencies like mine.”“In Stockton North, 11,700 workers remain fully furloughed and 5,200 of those jobs are deemed at risk because of this Tory government pushing ahead with the complete removal of the coronavirus job retention scheme.”“Residents in my constituency working in jobs hardest hit by this pandemic – like pubs, clubs and restaurants – will be wondering why this Tory government doesn’t seem to care about them or their livelihoods.”“Stockton already faces high levels of deprivation, removing support for industries that still can’t open at full capacity – if they can open at all – will be catastrophic.”“We need to see specialised and targeted support for those who still need it. This one size fits all approach is not fit for purpose.”Read more articlesPrevious PostAlex takes action to combat retail violence and protect retail staffNext PostAlex calls for Government action as unemployment soars in Stockton North.You Might Also LikeYouth surveyJanuary 6, 2012Alex blasts class-size increase plan in Wynyard secondary school disputeJuly 29, 2019Follow me on TwitterMy TweetsUseful LinksPrivacy PolicyHansard - When Alex speaks in ParliamentMeet with AlexContact AlexFollow UsOpens in a new tabOpens in a new tabOpens in a new tabOffice AddressStockton Business Centre70-74 Brunswick StreetStockton on TeesTS18 1DW© 2010 to 2021 Alex Cunningham MP.
