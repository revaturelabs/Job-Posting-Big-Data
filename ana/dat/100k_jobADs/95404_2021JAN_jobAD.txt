Estimators may travel to worksites, read blueprints and technical documents, collaborate with engineers and other high-level personnel, or consult construction experts in order to gather data regarding materials, labor, and time needed to complete the project. They analyze this information to calculate reasonable cost-effective budgets and probable project timelines. Strong computer skills are important, as most estimates are determined using programs.Estimators produce output for several purposes. Some focus on specific parts of a larger project, such as the time needed for a particular phase or cost of plumbing. Others compile these focused assessments into general estimates for the entire project. Still others might coordinate with sales teams to use their calculations to plan and deliver bids to clients.Search Estimator JobsAll Assistant Project Manager Assistant Superintendent Contract Administrator Division / Regional President Drafting / CAD Estimator Finance / Accounting Foreman / Supervisor Inspector Land Acquisition Marketing Planner / Scheduler President / CEO Project Manager / Construction Manager Purchasing Quality Assurance / Quality Control Safety Sales Superintendent Surveyor VP Construction Architect Civil Engineer Construction / Project Engineer - Other Electrical Engineer Geotechnical Engineer Mechanical Engineer Carpenter Carpet Installer Ceiling Tile Installer and Acoustical Carpenter Concrete and Terrazzo Finisher (Concrete Mason & Finisher) Controls / Telephone / Alarm / Cable Installer Drywall (Installer,Taper, Lather) Electrician Elevator Installer & Repairer Fence Erector Floor Layer (Except Carpet, Wood, and Hard Tile) Glazier Hard Tile Setter Hazardous Materials Removal Worker Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning Mechanic Heavy Equipment Operator (including Paver, Pile Driver) Insulation Worker Laborer Mason (Brick, Stone, Block) Millwright / Mechanic / Maintenance Painter and Paperhanger (construction and maintenance) Plasterer and Stucco Mason Plumber, Pipefitter, Pipelayer, and Steamfitter Reinforcing Metal Worker Roofer Sheet Metal (including Duct Installer) Structural Metal Worker Welder / Fabricator1-15 of 17 JobsArchitectural Casework EstimatorMadison, WI (6 miles from Middleton, WI)Candidate must be able to create T&M takeoffs for custom items and will have full responsibility for accuracy and completeness of submitted bids....3 days agoSenior Estimator (Glass and Glazing)GPAC - Madison, WI (6 miles from Middleton, WI)Resumes may be confidentially submitted to ......1 day agoFacilites Estimator & Proposal DeveloperMiddleton, WIRequired Education/Experience Bachelor's degree in Construction, Construction Management, Engineering, Project Management or a related field....2 days agoProject EstimatorGPAC - Madison, WI (6 miles from Middleton, WI): Commercial construction estimation experience Material take-off experience Ability to travel if needed Ability to read detailed prints and lay-outs Knowledge of agricultural facilities and construction...1 day agoFacilites Estimator & Proposal DeveloperPower Engineers - Madison, WI (6 miles from Middleton, WI)Management, Engineering, Project Management or a related field.+ A minimum of 7 years relevant project management and pre-construction experience in the construction industry including public infrastructure...20 hours agoManufacturing Costing EstimatorUniversal Presentation Concepts - Madison, WI (6 miles from Middleton, WI)First step is applying by submitting your application and resume.
