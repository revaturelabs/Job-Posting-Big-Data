In Italy, AVSI and the food chain Panino Giusto, which created a network with some of the biggest Italian food and beverage brands like Lavazza, give refugees and asylum-seekers access to the labor market with fair conditions to integrate into society as part of “Cook to Restart”.Both projects involve marginalized groups. In Ivory Coast: 5,000 direct beneficiaries are women, young adults with disabilities and HIV/AIDS patients. In Italy, 48 refugees and asylum-seekers were trained and 21 of them were hired in the last 2 years, thanks to the collaboration with 20 companies.Through vocational training, inclusion, women empowerment, and exposure to more job opportunities, the projects are examples of the contribution that AVSI supports in the EU fight against poverty and discrimination within and outside Europe, while endorsing the European Pillar of Social Rights.Meet the protagonists at our EDD stand 18 -19 June 2019 | Tour and Taxis | BrusselsAt the AVSI stand, the general public will have the opportunity to meet Ivorian artisan, Coulibaly Kadidia, and a young refugee residing in Italy, Precious Mbonu and listen to their stories.
