I’m sure a lot of ladies feel the same way, especially after having spent some of our holiday budgets on these fun party pieces, it would be a shame to put them away so soon. Here are some ideas on how to rework your most festive pieces into your wardrobe for 2014.This first holiday fashion leftover is one of the simplest items to mix and match with your current everyday wardrobe. The statement necklace has been on trend for a couple of years now and I will always feel that no matter how big and glamorous the necklace, it would always look effortless and cool when paired with an easy denim jean and simple top.Banana Republic Regency Necklace, $124J Brand 9037 Midori Boy Fit Jean in Paradise, $249.73The second fashion item that was popular during the holidays is a sequined, shimmery skirt. A party skirt can be easily revived for daytime by pairing it with a seemingly opposite casual top like a chambray shirt. One of my best girlfriends often pulls this look off and it is always the perfect blend of dressed up and casual.Ann Taylor Teardrop Sequin Skirt, $306.59 (online exclusive)J. Crew Factory Classic Chambray Shirt, $45.50 USDA party dress is an item that we’re usually quick to stash away in the backs of our closets after the occasion we bought it for, but we should try to give them more wear! If you have a dress in your closet in a strong solid colour like the Anthropologie one pictured here, add a cropped jacket, a belt, and some opaque tights to create a perfectly professional work outfit.Quezada Halter Dress, $150 USD (online exclusive), available at AnthropologieH&M Short Jacket in Black/Patterned, $29.95Banana Republic Black Patent Belt, $50Almost every store ramping up to the holiday season last year featured beautiful, boldly printed pants. If you’re like me and stocked up on more than one pair of this trend, you’ll be looking for opportunities to wear them in as many ways possible! Here, I’ve pulled together a quirky and cool girls night out look. The silver brocade printed pants from Joe Fresh no longer give off a holiday vibe when paired with a casual graphic tee and simple booties.Joe Fresh Brocade Pant in Silver, $29.94Hugo Guinness for J.Crew “Nobody’s Perfect” Linen Tee, $57.50Loeffler Randall Reese Kitten Heel Bootie, $395 USDBy: Liz Doré, TorontoAre you an employer?
