For perspective, officials said the state’s average number of new claims in a week is about 800.With COVID-19 shutdowns in full swing, many workers have found their hours cut drastically or have been sent home altogether.The New Mexico Department of Workplace Services has been working to educate the public on the best ways to file for unemployment given the scope of the situation.“We’re hearing the same story from all around the state,” said Bill McCamley, the NMDWS secretary. “A lot of service-sector folks have lost hours, but the reason is real. The governor is doing what she can to keep people safe and keep people from dying.”McCamley said that while the majority of those applying for aid have been from the service sector, the number of oil and gas workers who are filing is also increasing.The NMDWS is urging anyone who needs to file to go online first and foremost and added that around 93 percent of filers have done so. To assist with filing online, the NMDWS has released a video for New Mexicans applying for Unemployment Insurance, which explains the process step-by-step.McCamley added that the filing website has been holding up well despite the massive increase in traffic and has not shown any signs of crashing like several other states have experienced.“We understand this is a tough situation and we’re asking people to do three things: stay patient, we’re all doing this for the first time; stay kind, we believe we’re all one big family here in New Mexico; and understand we all want to play team ball. If we all work together we’ll be able to get through this in the best possible way.”Fast factsFor more information: http://www.jobs.state.nm.usYou might be interested in:Jail Logs - January 22Curry, Roosevelt could move to yellowSchools cleared for in-person learningAll of Clovis could hear lions roarClovis posts update on shooting complexMost PopularCommission boosts elec...Kevin WilsonSports get tentative r...Kevin WilsonInmates file tort clai...the Staff of The NewsIn-school learning to...the Staff of The NewsCurry votes to transit...Kevin WilsonXSectionsCalendarNewsLifestylesObituariesPuzzlesSpecial SectionsSportsVoicesParadeNewspaperContactSubscribeAboutPhotosWebsiteTerms of UsePrivacy PolicySitemapMobile BrowserAdvertiseAdvertiseBusiness DirectoryPlace a Classified AdContributeSubmit ContentLetter to the EditorConnect With UsThe Eastern New Mexico News521 Pile StreetClovis, NM 88102Ph: (575) 763-3431© 2021 Clovis Media IncPowered by ROAR Online Publication Software from Lions Light Corporation© Copyright 2020"
