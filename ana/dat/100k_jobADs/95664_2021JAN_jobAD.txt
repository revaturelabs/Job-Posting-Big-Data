We'll explain the important first steps you need to take to protect your right to workers’ compensation benefits.Five Steps to Take After Your Workplace InjuryUnder Florida law, you are required to take certain actions within set deadlines in order to be entitled to workers’ compensation benefits. Here are critical steps that must be followed:Report the injury to your employer. Do this as soon as possible after your accident. You're required to notify your supervisor or manager within 30 days of your accident or from the first signs of an occupational illness. If you fail to do this, you may not be eligible for benefits.Fill out a workplace injury report. Employers are obliged to keep workplace injury reports available for employees by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. When you’ve been injured, demand to fill out the report, even when your employer says it's not necessary, and get a copy for your records.Seek medical care. You need to immediately get medical treatment for your injuries, no matter how minor you initially believe they are. This ensures you receive proper medical care, and these records can protect you if there are disputes with your employer’s insurance company about whether your injuries were really work-related.File a claim. You should submit your claim for workers’ compensation benefits with the Florida Division of Workers’ Compensation as soon as possible after your accident. You must file a claim within two years of your injury or illness in order to be eligible for workers’ comp benefits.Retain an attorney.
