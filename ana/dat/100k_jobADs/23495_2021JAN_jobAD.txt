I can’t blame my unemployment on ageism. I passed high school English licensure in the spring, but no hits on a hire.Low turnover — understandable. So I just sat for the middle school English Language Arts Praxis exam and (uncharacteristically) think I nailed it. I love working with middle school students, but no one seemed interested in bringing me on board. My results are supposed to be reported on Aug 21 which is after the beginning of the school year. I have the worst timing.I don’t want to get my family sick from Covid-19. It feels like a best-case scenario to sub in schools where I am relatively safe until it’s prudent to commit full time in a more supportive school atmosphere for a beginning teacher.Then again, I’m not getting any younger, and it’s important that I find a job so we can move and save for retirement.It is no wonder that I don’t even know what to wish for anymore.Posted at 12:46 AM | PermalinkCommentsYou can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post.That is distressing.
