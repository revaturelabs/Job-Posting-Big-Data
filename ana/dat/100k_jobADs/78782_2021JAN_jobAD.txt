We have increased turnover with the extra work we generated.”The company manages a variety waste streams from a wide spectrum of industry across the UK, including general industrial waste, recycling of cardboard, plastics and metal waste and the handling and disposal of all types of hazardous wastes, including flammable, corrosive and toxic waste materials as well as dismantling and dealing with asbestos waste.“We have shown we can taske on significant work, and when needs be we are a business that will invest to ensure we maintain the highest standards and deliver a quality service to our customers,” Mr Taylor added.“This is a big year for Wastege and it is why we have invested so heavily in both people and equipment to ensure we are ready for the 12 months ahead.”The business, which has its head office in Wincolmee, Hull, and a base in West Thurrock, London, has quickly established a reputation as one of the region’s most compliant and fast-growing waste management companies.Its teams works at many of the UK ports analysing, packaging and disposing of fuels and chemical samples, and it has been called upon to carry out emergency waste clearance by organisations such as local authorities and the Environment Agency.“We are absolutely thrilled by the scale of work we have increasingly undertaken and the prestige of the clients turning to us. They are coming to us because of our reputation and growth, which is really pleasing,” added Mr Taylor.“We now have many excellent long-term retained clients growing our operations nationally. This has already enabled us to invest further in our business and create jobs this year.“We have employed four new drivers, a commercial manager to oversee the work and extra staff in accounts and administration.“When I launched the company I ensured we did everything in the right manner. We combine specialist knowledge with new technologies, the latest equipment and innovative ideas within the waste management industry.“Most importantly our clients know we are 100% compliant with the strictest of regulations, with a paper audit trails on each and every item of waste collected and disposed of. That is key to all we do.”Website: Wastege Ltd[Paul Baxter – Arrival PR]Share this:TweetEmailPost navigationPrevious PostEvie, 9, donates toys to Hull Royal in memory of friend Megan PrattNext PostResQ champions the Health Stars Impact AppealRelated PostsForecourt retailer helps to keep air ambulances flying14th January 2021 editorOrganisers commit to deliver a ‘refreshed and relevant’ Humber Business Week 202112th January 2021 editorTemporary changes as East Yorkshire buses respond to national lockdown11th January 2021 editorUniversity of Hull secures £1m of Physics funding for major European projects8th January 2021 editorLeave a Reply Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment.Privacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
