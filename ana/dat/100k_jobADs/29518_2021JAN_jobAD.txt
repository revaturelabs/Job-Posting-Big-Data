Now it is clear that St. Mary’s High School will welcome the newly-out Alfson with open arms.After coming out in an article for OutSports, Alfson, who coaches volleyball and baseball, met Tuesday with administrators. It was in this meeting Alfson was told he could keep his job, of which the Argus Leader reports the coach saying:” ‘We talked about being on the same page as each other and that they were willing to walk through this with me and support me…They want me to be their volleyball coach again and that I was a great role model to the athletes.’ …” ‘I couldn’t be happier that they are supportive and want me to be a part of the coaching team…It’s a sense of relief to be able to move forward and focus on volleyball and the girls. This season is about them and the hard work they put in. The support has been amazing and I can’t wait to live a free life.’ “School administrators did not comment, though the Diocese of Sioux Falls released a statement saying gay church workers are welcome to work as long as their lifestyles were deemed chaste, the same expectations made of heterosexual workers. (Though the definitions of chastity are different for these two groups.)Alfson’s decision to come out publicly was a courageous one, especially with so many recent instances of LGBT church workers being fired for telling the truth about their lives. New Ways Ministry tracks the firing and resignations of LGBT and ally church workers. Fourteen people have been forced out this year alone. I was worried that after writing about Alfson’s deeply personal and wise article, I would shortly be writing the story about his firing too. That St. Mary’s administrators are willing to stand by Alfson and foremost follow Catholic teachings on the dignity of each person and social justice, especially relating to labor issues, is a hopeful sign.This development comes in the same week that news broke that a high school run by the Sisters of Mercy dedicated their athletic field to alumna Abby Wamback, an internationally famous athlete who is also a married lesbian.Now, it is essential for Catholic schools to keep this momentum going. The last two weeks, staff members from New Ways Ministry have attended annual meetings for the Conference of Major Superiors of Men and the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, the two separate organizations of the leaders of men’s and women’s religious communities in the U.S. While at these meetings, New Ways Ministry is asking these leaders to implement LGBT-inclusive non-discrimination policies at their schools and institutions. At our exhibit table, we are distributing a brochure explaining how such policies can be adopted. While non-committal, the leaders’ responses have been positive to this idea.Additionally, you can advocate for LGBT and ally church workers by raising the issue of non-discrimination policies within their your local parish or Catholic school. Below are suggestions for how you can make a difference:1. Educate Yourself. Learn more about the current challenges LGBT church workers face, including firings, by reading Francis DeBernardo’s essay in Conscience magazine. You can find that by clicking here. Bondings 2.0 also lists every LGBT-related public firing at a Catholic institution since 2008 on our “Catholicism, Employment, and LGBT Issues” page. There you will find further information about each case. Finally, you can read Bondings 2.0‘s full coverage by checking out the ‘Employment Issues‘ category to the right and to receive the latest updates enter your email in the “Subscribe” box in the upper right hand of this page.”2. Take Action. Adding a sufficient non-discrimination policy at your local Catholic institution could be as simple as adding the following: “(Name of parish, school, or institution) will not discriminate in employment practices on the basis of marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and personal support for marriage equality.” For more tips on establishing LGBT-inclusive policies, click here.3. Connect. If you want help with adopting a non-discrimination policy or anything related to Catholic LGBT employment issues, you can contact New Ways Ministry by emailing info@newwaysministry.org or calling (301) 277-5674 for further resources and information.Now that Nate Alfson is proudly out and ready to return to coaching, he told reporters: “I can breath, I can smile, and I’m not afraid to cry, and I’m not afraid to feel what I’m feeling.” It is past time to make this sense of freedom and authenticity normative for every teacher, student, administrator, parent, and alumni involved with Catholic education. What difference will you make this fall?–Bob Shine, New Ways MinistryShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...RelatedTags: Catholic, education, Gay, LGBThttps://www.newwaysministry.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/logo_nwm-1.png 0 0 Robert Shine, Managing Editor https://www.newwaysministry.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/logo_nwm-1.png Robert Shine, Managing Editor2014-08-14 01:00:432014-08-14 01:00:43Gay Coach Will Keep His Job at Catholic High School13 repliesRyan Sattler says:August 14, 2014 at 5:49 amNow that’s a great “follow up” story. Of course, the issue to be free to be with the person you love has not been answered. For now, Nate, be the best coach, be that great role model, that you are. We are so proud of who you are and pleased that “you can breathe again.” Blessings on you and everyone at your school!ReplyBrian Kneeland says:August 14, 2014 at 7:28 amIt is good they will not fire him – yet the expectation that he will never fall in love with someone is unrealistic and certainly they expect “chastity” which is a charism of religious orders. However, while they say that is expected of heterosexuals as well, I know from experience it is not enforced for them. So – it is a baby step forward but there is so much further to go!ReplyAnton says:August 14, 2014 at 7:57 amThis is wonderful “good news.” When Jesus called the publican, Zacchaeus, out of his tree (closet) and invited himself to his home, the self-righteous onlookers GRUMBLED, that he’s going to the home of a sinner. Jesus didn’t back down: “This, too is a son of Abraham”, he gladly went to his home. It’s about time Jesus’ followers follow his example. He also gave the Canaanite woman what she asked for and then gave her more than crumbs from the children’s table. He performed a miracle of multiplication of loaves and fishes in her gentile territory. Many, many LGBT people “do for the least of Jesus’ sisters and brothers” and are welcomed eventually through the pearly gates. “These, too, are my followers/disciples.”Thank you, Jesus!ReplyNancy Dunn says:August 14, 2014 at 7:35 pmThis is my daughters coach. He’s a great coach, period. That’s all that matters. Actually I was surprised they didn’t ask him to leave. I’m proud they didn’t. Yes, we need more of this.ReplyTrackbacks & PingbacksA Tale of Honesty, Courage, Community: A Catholic College Athlete Comes Out – Bondings 2.0 says:	November 19, 2016 at 1:00 am	[…] Gay Coach Will Keep His Job at Catholic High School […]ReplyIHM School To ‘Rethink’ Policies After Firing Lesbian Teacher | Bondings 2.0 says:	September 27, 2014 at 1:01 am	[…] forget that you matter.” It then surprised many when the Dell Rapids, South Dakota school did not fire Alfson.
