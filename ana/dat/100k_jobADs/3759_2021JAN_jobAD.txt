I’ve decided to integrate our On-the-Job Online Advanced Scrum Master / Kanban Coaching workshop with our Team-Agility Coach (our integration of Scrum/Kanban workshop.Our online workshop is normally $595 but when you take our Scrum/Kanban master course we’ll include that for $200 a person. This means that our 2 day workshop followed by our 3 month program is $10,400 for 12 people ($500 for each additional person).The onsite aspect of this integrates Scrum and Kanban. The three month program has me work with participants helping them apply what they’ve learned, as well as advanced topics of Agile, with their teams.Please message me if you’re interested.Author Al ShallowayPosted on 2019-01-29 Categories Coaching, Kanban, Lean Agile Adoption, Lean-Agile, Learning Teaching Coaching, Scrum, Team Level Agile	Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
