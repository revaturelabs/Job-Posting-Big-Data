For this reason, we will be delaying the opening until the new year, with a date to be announced,\" Costco posted to Facebook on November 29.While people commenting on Facebook are throwing around a March open date the spokesperson could not confirm if that was accurate or if it wasn't.Progress at Costco Bundamba.
