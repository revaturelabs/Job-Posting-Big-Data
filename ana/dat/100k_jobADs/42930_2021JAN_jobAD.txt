(Times-Call file photo)	By Longmont Times-Call |February 28, 2012 at 4:48 p.m.LONGMONT — Abound Solar on Tuesday cut 280 jobs — 70 percent of the workers — at the company’s production facility along the Interstate 25 Frontage Road near Firestone.The company notified the workers, which had been running three shifts around the clock, on Tuesday, according to chief financial officer Steve Abely. The cuts affected 180 full-time workers and 100 temporary workers Abound had hired.Abound, which manufactures thin-film photovoltaic solar modules, made the cuts because it is abandoning work on its first-generation module and switching to a next-generation module that will be much more efficient, Abely said, adding that company officials hope most of the cuts are only temporary.“We’re shutting down the production line so that we can basically retool the facility and perfect the process,” Abely said late Tuesday afternoon.After the factory is retooled and its next-generation module passes field trials by its customers, Abely said Abound hopes to ramp production back up in six to nine months and hire at least as many workers as it had to cut.“Hopefully at the end of that time period we will bring people back,” Abely said by phone late Tuesday afternoon.He said the company’s permanent employees who were let go received severance pay and were paid for their accrued vacation and personal days.The cuts leave about 120 people employed at the facility, which opened in 2009.He said that though Tuesday’s announcement was difficult for all involved, “The good news is that the next-generation product has already been certified by (the National Renewable Energy Laboratory),” Abely said.He said the new generation of modules have a solar efficiency of about 12.5 percent, up from the previous module’s rating of 10.5 percent.The solar efficiency rating is based on how much light that hits the solar panel is converted into electricity. The most efficient panels built today, which go onto satellites, have about a 40 percent conversion rate, Abely said.Improving to 12.5 from 10.5 percent doesn’t sound like much, but “12.5 percent is superior to the current technology that’s out there,” he said.Abely said the company’s next-generation module will help the company stay competitive globally, even in the face of fierce competition from the Chinese, whose solar companies receive billions in subsidies.Aside from the subsidies, the four largest Chinese solar companies are able to sell their products into the global market while the Chinese government does not allow the same of foreign companies wanting to sell into that country, he said.“Everybody is selling right now below their cost in manufacturing,” Abely said. “Even the biggest Chinese companies.”Tuesday’s announcement has no effect on the $400 million loan guarantee that the U.S. Department of Energy announced for Abound in July 2010, Abely said.So far Abound has taken about $70 million of that out in loans, and is in communication with the DOE at least weekly, he said.“They understand what’s going on,” Abely said. “They’re very supportive of the company and its technology.”He said the DOE loan is directly tied to Abound continuing to manufacture its products in the U.S., and by extension indirectly tied to its creating jobs, both of which it hopes to be doing again before the end of the year, Abely said.Regarding the company’s planned production facility in Tipton, Ind., which it began leasing in 2010, Abound said it plans to focus first on getting its next-generation module production going and likely wouldn’t have an announcement regarding the Tipton facility until the middle of next year.Abound was launched based on technology developed at Colorado State University. Its corporate headquarters are in Loveland while its 126,000-square-foot Frontage Road facility technically has a Longmont address. It also leases another 37,000-square-foot Longmont facility where it builds equipment for its solar modules.Tony Kindelspire can be reached at 303-684-5291 or at tkindelspire@times-call.com.Sign up for email newslettersSubscribeFollow UsFacebookTwitterRSSMost PopularFirestone district fire investigators rule reported house explosion as accidental	Suspect in Longmont Operation Misfire found after failing to appear for court since August	UPDATE: All lanes open on I-25 in Loveland after morning crash of 2 semis	Polis, local leaders urge RTD to prioritize Northwest Rail line to Boulder County	Longmont police notes: Cat bites man	Longmont police notes: Police investigating theft of $1,000	What Times-Call readers said this week	One person hospitalized, home damaged in reported explosion in Firestone	TC Line calls for Saturday, Jan. 23, 2021	How they voted: Longmont-area congressional votes for the week of Jan. 15-21, 2021	Longmont Times-CallMore in NewsSmucker’s plant ramps up expansion, boosting Longmont’s economy on the way	Longmont police notes: Police investigating theft of $1,000	Boulder County reports 55 new coronavirus cases, no new deaths	Free SVVSD VEX Robotics Online Academy is open for signup through Sunday	Brought to you by Prairie Mountain PublishingSolar Energy Is A NaturalColorado has over 300 days of sunshine each year—why not put that energy to work to reduce your utility bills,...Help With Funeral PlanningFamilies who have lost a loved one often need help with funeral planning.
