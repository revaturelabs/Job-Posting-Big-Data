Detective Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson, a new case start when Dr. Professor Moriarty start doing new crimes. Chasing Professor Moriarty and stop his plans is the priority of Holmes.Movie Review: If you are a fan of a serious suspense mystery movie then this is not for you. Instead of adding this movie to is a suspense thriller movie, I add it first in action-comedy adventure movies. Not like all other Sherlock movies, this has a unique style of telling the story. It tells you a suspense movie in a comedy-action manner. Every scene collects some comedy humor. The movie starts with Sherlock and Watson's chasing Professor Moriarty. Just like other Sherlock movies in this movie you see Sherlock as an intelligent person and Watson as a helping hand. The conversation between Sherlock and Watson is very funny. The fights between Sherlock and Watson will make you laugh. Watson wants to leave the detective job and get settled by marrying a lady. On the other side, Holmes wants Watson to be with him. Moriarty target Watson to hurt the Holmes, but Holmes save the Watson. It will make you smile whenever Sherlokh does dumb things. The main story of the movie starts when the Moriarty start doing new crimes and planning for the big crime. Now this case will be assigned to Sherlock. If you thinking that it just has comedy flavor, then you are wrong this movie also has suspense, mystery, and lots of action. All VFX effects are looks natural and believable. You will see some cute romance between Holmes and one lady(Rachel McAdams).Step by step movie made very nicely, every scene looks logical. I don't like that we already know the villain from starting. Because in suspense movies best part is identifying the killer. You will see old Sherlokh villain Professor Moriarty, back in this movie. In between the movie you will get stunned with the plan of Professor Moriarty. As usual like all other Sherlokh movies after long mystery, everything gets settled. I have seen Professor Moriarty get lots of opportunity to kill Holmes but he never does it directly, which is a little unbelievable. Holmes tries to understand Mariarty's plan on the other side Mariarty try to kill Homes and Watson. This chase between Moriarty and Holmes is very amazing. Robert Downey Jr. as a Sherlock did a wonderful job Jude Law also did great work. As usual like all other Rachel McAdams movies, she did a fabulous job. Rachel McAdams and Robert Downey Jr. chemistry look so beautiful. But Rachel McAdams only have small part in this movie. Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty did a good job. All other actors acting looks professional. Cinematography and Direction of the movie are very well done, all scenes, story well managed. Step by step story will go without confusing you. Music seems to be a little loud, but it's detective swag.Positive points of the movie:Well, this has a unique and mystery story. I think the uniqueness of the movie is a plus point. The comedy stuff between Sherlock and Watson is very funny. That is very very funny, if you are a fan of comedy movies then you going to love this movie. Professor Moriarty's plans and how Holmes handles all the plans are very much surprising.Negative points of the movie:Overall I loved this movie, but I found this movie a little predictable. As a suspense movie fan, I will be happy with an unpredictable story. But in this movie you can predict the villain, and what he is trying to do from starting.Overall My Rating:Just because of missing more mystery moments I drop 1 star. But overall I happily give it 04 out of 05 stars:)4.0Others Ratings:Sherlock Holmes 2009 IMDB Rating: 7.5/10Sherlock Holmes 2009 Rotten Tomatoes: 60%Sherlock Holmes 2009 Metacritic: 48%Movie Recommended:Not Watchable!Watchable!Surely Watchable!Conclusion:Overall I recommend you to give your time to this movie, and watch it.
