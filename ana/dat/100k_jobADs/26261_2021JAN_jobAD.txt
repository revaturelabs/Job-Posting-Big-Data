With their company bonuses, They bring home high 6 figures annual packages as well.Not true at all - they don't bring home high 6 figures annual packages.#20 (permalink)05-08-2014, 04:58 PMUnregisteredGuestPosts: n/aQuote:Originally Posted by UnregisteredNot true at all - they don't bring home high 6 figures annual packages.I agree. Both my brothers are pilots, 1 with SIA Cargo and another with SIA passenger.If you are a senior pilot, then yes $20k/month possible. but to earn that amount you already have 1 foot in the grave.A mid 30's commercial airline pilot will earn $280k/year including bonuses.Same commercial pilot in 50's will be getting $420k/year including bonuses.Nowhere near high 6 figure salary.Hedge fund managers, private equity financial consultants, oil traders, oil brokers, are all in the high 6 / low 7 club.Page 2 of 3 < 1 2 3 >BookmarksDiggdel.icio.usStumbleUponGoogle« Previous Thread | Next Thread »Thread ToolsShow Printable VersionEmail this PagePosting RulesYou may not post new threadsYou may post repliesYou may not post attachmentsYou may not edit your postsBB code is OnSmilies are On[IMG] code is OnHTML code is OffTrackbacks are OffPingbacks are OnRefbacks are OffForum RulesSimilar ThreadsThread Thread Starter Forum Replies Last PostHighest paying jobs Salary.sg Income and Jobs 16 05-04-2010 03:55 PMHow many people made 6-figure salaries last year?
