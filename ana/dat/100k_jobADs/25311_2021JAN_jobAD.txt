"Plannet Plumbing Services Ltd: Change of use jobPlannet Plumbing Services LtdAccredited installers of Honeywell controls. Accredited installers of Worcester boilers. Water Industry Approved Plumbers {WIAPS} Fast response repair specialistsTuesday, 27 November 2012Change of use jobHere are a few pictures from what the planning department call a 'Change of use' job. A former bedroom has been converted into an en suite bathroom. It compries of a 760mm shower cubicle, a wash basin on a pedestal, a toilet and a towel rail radiator. We are just doing the finishing touches today.We had to excavate the driveway and form a branch into the the main drain for a soil vent pipe to serve the new bathroom. We also replaced a broken rainwater gulley and resited it against the wall. I took this picture whilst waiting for the building inspector to pass the drains so we could stone it up and back fill.All walls inside were tiled and the existing radiator was replaced with a chrome ladder style towel rail with concealed pipes.The shower valve is a built in Mira with a variable riser kit. All pipework is concealed in the cupboard we constructed that backs onto the shower.I had to stand on a step ladder to get this shot. The tray is also by Mira as is the fold down seat and the cubicle. The floor you will note has been over layed with plywood in readiness for a non slip vinyl covering which is getting fitted once we are completed.The 450mm wide basin is rather compact and has been selected due to space being of a premium. The tap is by Bristan.We carried out all the external drainage work, the plastering, joinery, resiting a boiler, electrics and tiling as well as the plumbing. Our customer had just one company to deal with; us. If you'd like another bathroom and aren't sure if it's possible or think it may cost too much or don't fancy dealing with lots of different trades or building inspectors please give us a call. We can take care of everything and it may not cost as much as you think.Posted by Paul Dooley at 15:07Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestNewer Post Older Post HomePopular PostsPlume Management KitThis is at a guest house in Blackpool where we fitted out the new boiler room & system controls.

There is a steady supply of maintenance to attend to including a job up in Blackpool.29/03/2010 - The last of our housing trust partnering contract boilers is getting fitted this week. It's been a satisfying job upgrading these systems and getting them working how they are supposed to.22/03/2010 - We are hoping to do at least two boiler swaps and control upgrades this week from our batch which needs completing before April. The so called 'urgent' maintenance is definately slowing down giving us chance to catch our breath after what has been a very hectic winter.15/03/2010 - The 1st signs that the urgency is going out of the maintenance market as the weather begins to improve. Suddenly waiting in for an engineer becomes less of a priority for social housing and private landlord tenants. We even have some work orders for new boilers but can't get into the properties.This is a common pattern for the spring & summer months.08/03/2010 - Solid maintenance and breakdowns. It's nearly all boilers but we've swapped a couple of showers this week too.01/03/2010 - Enquiries from the general public are starting to pick up but it is our commercial clients who are keeping us very busy with maintenance which is mainly boiler breakdowns.22/02/2010 - With the exception of one boiler swap it's all maintenance much of which is fast response stuff.15/02/10 - Still very hectic on the maintenance and a fair sized gas pipework job to fit in on wednesday.

Once we are all up to date we can start on our batch of 12 boiler changes.11/01/10 - It's a bit more like normal this week as the thaw starts. We've been busy still on the boiler breakdowns. January is always a quiet month for installations but we've been lucky enough to pick up a batch of 12 boiler swaps for a housing trust client. They are standard efficiency boilers which are getting swapped for band A high efficiency models.04/01/10 - It's been a funny week! The heavy snow brought many schools, roads and businesses to a stand still, but not us. We've been out & about all week doing mainly repairs and breakdowns. There's been a lot of high efficiency boilers which have locked out due to their external condensate drains freezing up. In a lot of cases we simply talked customers through it over the phone and got them up and running again.28/12/09 - We finished on the morning of 24/12/09 and are back on 04/01/10. We provide emergency cover over the holiday for a small number of clients who pay us a retainer to be available. This system works well. Anyone wishing to know more about it please e-mail me for details.21/12/09 - It's a short week and we are mopping up any outstanding bits of work. A few parts which have been on order will be coming in to conclude matters. A ghost of Christmas past {who we haven't heard from for at least 10 years} will usually materialise on Christmas Eve at around 4.00pm wanting a bathroom fitting before Christmas! I wonder who it will be this year :-)13/12/09 - December is a busy month and there is no need for us to programme any installations in as a steady flow of work comes in naturally on a daily basis. December can trick you though into thinking you are busier than you are. This is because a lot of the work is \"I need it before Christmas\" stuff. This is usually none urgent jobs which really could wait or should have been done weeks, or even months in some cases, earlier.One customer rang this week wanting to proceed with a job we quoted for back in March! Yes she wanted it doing before Christmas.....07/12/09 - Day to day maintenance & repairs all of which seems to be heating, fires & boilers. Completed our last boiler swap of the year too which was for a lettings agent.30/11/09 - We are only doing one more boiler swap between now and Christmas. The rest of the time will be booked solid with breakdowns and maintenance which is coming in on a daily basis by referral, phone & e-mail.There is a definate link to the urgency of customers and the weather! If we get a mild day then the demands become less..... I think mild days will be thin on the ground now though......23/11/09 - We are just about keeping abreast of the flood of breakdowns and maintenance coming in. Meanwhile we have a boiler swap and system controls upgrade job to do too.16/11/09 - I didn't think the maintenance could get any busier but it has.
