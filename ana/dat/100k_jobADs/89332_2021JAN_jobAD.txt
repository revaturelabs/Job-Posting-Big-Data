I have experience on USA Swimming's National Age Group Development Committee and I have 12 years of experience in the sport. I am a fast learner and can adapt to any club's values and needs. I work well with groups of all ages and want to contribute to a team's culture in a very impactful way. I am a hard worker and I am willing to put in extra time to be successful. I am going to be balancing any coaching with school in the second semester. However, given the probability of online learning, I will be very flexible.Seeking Coaching Positions for Spring Semester Saint Paul, MN, USALoad moreHomeContactAbout UsTerms & ConditionsEmployerPost a JobSearch ResumesSign inJob SeekerFind JobsCreate ResumeSign in© 2008-2021 Powered by SmartJobBoard Job Board Software"
