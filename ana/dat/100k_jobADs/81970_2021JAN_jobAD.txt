The teak decks were perfectly flat and unblemished by any accoutrements. As at an Apple store, the cabin windows were large panes, almost floor to ceiling, and the main living area was designed to have walls of glass that were forty feet long and ten feet high. He had gotten the chief engineer of the Apple stores to design a special glass that was able to provide structural support. By then the boat was under construction by the Dutch custom yacht builders Feadship, but Jobs was still fiddling with the design. “I know that it’s possible I will die and leave Laurene with a half-built boat,” he said. “But I have to keep going on it. If I don’t, it’s an admission that I’m about to die.”Well now after six years of construction his yacht has finally been finished. Steve Jobs’ widow Laurene and thier 3 children were there for the launch of venus.Via: applegoss.comFacebookTwitterTumblrPinterestRedditLinkedInPocketEmailLike this:Like Loading...RelatedThis entry was posted in Photos, Tech, Video and tagged apple, Ship, steve jobs, Tech, Venus, Yacht.
