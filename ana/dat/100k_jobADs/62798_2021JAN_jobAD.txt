It said the plans would cost between £15m ($20m) and £19m, “reflecting the group’s enhanced redundancy policy.”Carl Cowling, WH Smith’s chief executive, said COVID-19 continued to have a significant impact on the group, with recovery “slow” at transport hubs.He said further cost-cutting was needed. “I regret that this will have an impact on a significant number of colleagues whose roles will be affected by these necessary actions, and we will do everything we can to support them at this challenging time.”The update added that the board was “confident” the company had sufficient funds to sustain itself during a “prolonged downturn,” despite burning through £15-20m in July. It has £63m of cash and access to £320m of borrowing facilities.The company’s shares were trading 4.5% higher on Wednesday.TRENDINGThe IndependentBiden gets controversial Trump officials to resign in first act on inauguration dayThe Independent·3-min readThe TelegraphTravellers coming to UK without negative Covid tests waved through border controlsThe Telegraph·3-min readThe IndependentTed Cruz slams Biden for rejoining climate crisis agreement ‘for Paris citizens’The Independent·5-min readThe IndependentBrexit news - live: UK must ‘be very careful’, Barnier warns in row over EU’s diplomatic statusThe Independent·1-min readDigital SpyGMB's Kate Garraway says she's \"physically low\" as she shares Derek updateDigital Spy·3-min readLatest storiesThe IndependentTrump extended Secret Service protection for 13 members of his family as he left officeAdded security detail will be deployed for six more months, and cost tax payers millions19 hours agoYahoo Celebrity UKKate Garraway says husband Derek Draper has been 'ravaged' by coronavirusThe presenter's husband has been in hospital since March last year.9 hours agoYahoo News UKChart shows how quickly the UK is vaccinating compared with the rest of the worldIsrael is currently the only country to have vaccinated more than a third of the population.3 hours agoThe IndependentBrexit news - live: UK must ‘be very careful’, Barnier warns in row over EU’s diplomatic statusFollow the latest updates here3 hours agoYahoo News UKCOVID deaths reach record high as Sage adviser warns government is 'divided against itself'The warning came as the UK reported a record number of daily deaths for the second time in a week.a day agoThe IndependentTed Cruz slams Biden for rejoining climate crisis agreement ‘for Paris citizens’Texas senator appears to believe accord only benefits residents of French capital and attracts vicious rebuke from comedian Seth Rogen over role in inciting Capitol riot6 hours agoDigital SpyGMB's Kate Garraway says she's \"physically low\" as she shares Derek updateKate shared a frank update on her husband's condition.8 hours agoYahoo News UKInteractive map shows how many new COVID cases there are in your areaKnowsley in Merseyside currently has the highest rate of new coronavirus infections, with a seven-day rolling rate of 1,136 cases per 100,000 people.7 hours agoThe IndependentBarnier warns government to be ‘very careful’ amid row over EU’s diplomatic status in UKFormer head of the diplomatic service describes move as ‘wholly unnecessary’2 hours agoThe ConversationCoronavirus: why combining the Oxford vaccine with Russia's Sputnik V vaccine could make it more effectiveVaccines that use harmless viruses as a delivery mechanism are vulnerable to being attacked by our immune system – but experimenting with how they are given could get around this.6 hours agoYahoo News UKHow fast is COVID-19 spreading in your area?

The EU’s chief negotiator said there was still “anger” against Brussels in many regions of Europe. He said that Brexit had exposed the dangers and consequences of leaving the bloc but said it was up to the EU to prove that membership of the bloc was worthwhile. “We have to draw the lessons of Brexit. We have to understand why 52 percent of the British people voted against Europe [...] ” It is obviously too late for the UK but it is not too late for the other member states,” Mr Barnier said. He said, “Today, in many regions, there is this anger, the same feeling against Europe, the same problem to understand what we’re doing at the European level,” he said. “We have to be vigilant because it is always a risk for the future,” he added, “This risk can be combated by the proof that it is clearly a better situation to be inside the EU than outside.” “Brexit has exposed the consequences of leaving the EU for all to see,” he said, ““Even though we have a deal the UK’s choices mean that there will be inevitable short-term and long-term consequences.” He added, “Together, we can build a Europe that not only protects but also inspires. A Europe that Europeans would never dream of leaving. “Why should we leave the EU debate to anti EU parties? For all those who believe in the European project this is not the time to sit back and to be complacent.” Mr Barnier said he had noted British plans to diverge from EU rules such as the Working Time Directive after Brexit. “We are not surprised because we are not naive,” Mr Barnier said. The important thing for the EU was that Britain’s new found regulatory freedom did not become “a tool for dumping against us.” If Britain was to undercut EU standards to gain an unfair competitive advantage over European businesses, Mr Barnier said, the bloc would not hesitate to use remedial measures, which could include tariffs, in the trade deal. “In that case we will use the tools included in the treaty,” he said. Mr Barnier is soon to step down as the EU’s chief negotiator to become a special advisor to Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. His focus will be on the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and ratification of the Brexit trade deal. From March, he plans to return to French politics. He was speaking after being named European of the Year by the European Movement Ireland.4 hours agoThe IndependentJoe Biden says Donald Trump left him a ‘very generous’ letter in Oval OfficePresident says he will not reveal details until speaking to predecessor19 hours agoThe IndependentFive dead in ‘massive’ blaze at site of world’s largest vaccine makerFire broke out in an under-construction building at the site of the Serum Institute of India but vaccine production will not be affected, officials say3 hours agoMore stories"
