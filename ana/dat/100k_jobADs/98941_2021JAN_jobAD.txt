This is both candidates second interview. pic.twitter.com/r7OH8w1gsD— Keith Pompey (@PompeyOnSixers) September 17, 2018Zanik and Rosas are two of the more-renowned executives who haven’t already run a front office. In other words, they might represent the ceiling of whom Philadelphia can attract. The 76ers reportedly want a collaborative approach, which has merits but will also dissuade more accomplished executives who want more control.I wouldn’t assume Zanik and Rosas are necessarily the finalists for the job. They might be, but given the slowness of this process, others – maybe many others – could get more interviews.Leave a commentScroll Down For:FOLLOW US Facebook Twitter Instagram NBC Sports Social Directory©2021 NBC UniversalAd Choices Advertise Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Personal Information CA Notice Closed Captioning Pressbox Sports Jobs Our History NBC Sports Terms of Use NBC Sports Live FAQ NBC Sports Gold Int'l Terms of Service NBC Sports Gold FAQGET NEWSLETTERS & ALERTSSIGN UPSend to Email Address Your Name Your Email AddressCancelPost was not sent - check your email addresses!
