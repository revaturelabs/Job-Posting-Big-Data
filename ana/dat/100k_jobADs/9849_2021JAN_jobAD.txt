Here’s what I suggest you do to ensure we have a productive session:If you have a resume, take a coloured pen and highlight for me anything about your current and previous jobs that have been consistently satisfying or particularly enjoyable, i.e. job duties, projects, assignments.If you don’t have a resume, just write them down. If there isn’t anything, that’s okay too.And write down anything you have done outside of work over the years that has been consistently satisfying, e.g. hobbies, sports, interests, volunteer activities, home projects, classes/assignments at uni/college/school.This gives me a starting point for a basic assessment of your natural strengths and motivations. Then we can spend an hour or so discussing where should you go? which orgs or work settings will motivate you? and what should you do there? what are the specific job titles that best match your talents, experience, education, and other factors, such as your health condition and values/priorities.What you getSometimes, all it takes is one session to send you on the path to job joy. I can tell a lot from analyzing your stories.“I wanted out of government,” says J.K. , a former policy analyst with DINA. “George helped me to understand in detail who and what I am. Today, I’m out of government, my income is higher and I’m happier!”L.G., a former employee of ISTC says Of Dutch, “He identifies skills that are so close to you, you don’t even think about them.”“I’m much happier now. Lots of opportunities springing up. No more secretarial work for me. Thank you, George.” D.M., Computer Trainer, Ottawa.“I’d been declared surplus and heard George Dutch on the radio. I knew then he could help me to plan my next move. His advice has been excellent. The positive results were almost immediate,” says G.M., a project manager with Veterans Affairs.At the end of the session, I can tell you what will serve you best in terms of next steps, depending on your needs and priorities.
