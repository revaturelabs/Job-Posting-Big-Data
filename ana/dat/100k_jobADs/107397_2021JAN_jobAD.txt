How can you significantly improve your chances of making it to the final group and being the one selected for the position? What is it the pushes the final candidate over the top?It’s all about value…More specifically being able to clearly demonstrate/articulate the value that you bring to the team/organization will set you apart from other candidates. I know this sounds nebulous. Webster defines value as the regard that something is held to deserve; the importance, worth, or usefulness of something.There is a plethora of information, articles, blog posts and advice available about resume writing and navigating through the application process to actually getting an interview. Most of this advice focuses on skills, experience and showing you meet the requirements. Who wants to hire “Meets Requirements?” Value transcends skills and experience and allows you to paint a picture of the impact that you will have on the organization. How powerful is that?In my world, value starts with your personal brand…Those 3 or 4 traits that define you as a person and serve as your guiding light. All of those thought-provoking interview questions and scenarios you run into aim to give the hiring manager some insight into how you approach situations. They are probing to uncover what guides you and the overall value that you might bring to the organization in the future. I believe personal brand is the deciding factor when it comes to making the final hiring decision. For me, it’s all about integrity, value and commitment.What is your personal brand? What is it that guides you in your career and everyday life? Do some real soul-searching here and think about what you stand for and how you would like to be perceived. From today on make sure that your decisions, your actions and how others perceive you consistently reflect your personal brand. If you don’t like it…Change it…Now! Start making decisions and performing in a manner that will enable you answer those tough interview questions with real life examples that reflect your personal brand.The next part of the value equation is being able to show how you will perform and fit into the organization. I spent a good part of my career leading large information technology support teams covering multiple states and large geographic territories. I learned to appreciate the overall effectiveness and performance of the people I had supporting the remote areas and what I call their Remote Mentality. It’s all about being able to thrive in a culture of empowerment, ownership and mission.What could be more valuable to a hiring manager, a team or an organization than bringing in someone who serves the mission, owns their area of responsibility and always does the right thing?Lastly, let’s talk about skills and experience from a value perspective. What skill, what experience, what knowledge do you have that will bring the most value to the teams/organizations you wish to join? Throughout our careers, all of us experience new initiatives, projects, roll-outs, acquisitions and mergers…Change in general. Did you lead the effort? Were you a contributor? Did you embrace the change? Did you blaze a trail? What tangible results did your organization realize from your efforts?Use this value perspective to craft your elevator pitch, resume and the real life examples you plan on talking about during the interview process. The idea is to paint a clear, concise picture of the great things you will do and why you are the best choice for this position.In 2007, I founded Beaullieu & Associates, Inc., to be the antithesis of today’s recruiting practices by offering a unique, high-end approach to IT Staffing & Recruiting that focuses on delivering value, performance and results.Today more than ever, our clients appreciate our approach and the overall value we bring.
