W. Russell, FCSIPresident and CEOTweetJanuary 30, 2020 by Ian RussellStructural change in investment industry will break loose this coming year as competitive conditions intensifyMy latest President’s Letter describes the difficulties for small and mid-sized dealers to access external capital to build operating scale to compete in the retail marketplace. The impending changes toward regulatory consolidation, such as SRO amalgamation, and related significant cost-savings, will place even more competitive pressures on small firms. Regulators need to redouble efforts to focus on proportionate regulation and “scalability” versions of core regulations.You can click here to read my Letter.TweetNovember 28, 2019 by Ian RussellIIAC Securities Industry & Capital Markets Chartbook 2009-2018The Investment Industry Association of Canada (IIAC) is pleased to provide this Chartbook illustrating the major trends shaping Canada’s securities industry and capital markets over the past decade.Through the financial crisis industry performance suffered as investment dealers succumbed to market headwinds and unfavourable business conditions. The result was a significant restructuring of Canada’s securities industry marked by dealer consolidation, reduced employment and changes to dealer business models.However, the industry has proven resilient, not only regaining lost ground but achieving new heights on many notable fronts.The IIAC Chartbook illustrations reveal that the industry has played a pivotal role in expanding Canadian financial markets over the past decade and supporting the growing capital needs of the country’s governments and businesses – essential building blocks for a prosperous economy. With more than $2.5 trillion in client assets under management the industry has become a key channel for accumulating and growing investor savings.Changing demographics, new regulations, market and macroeconomic uncertainty and the growth of digital-advice and Financial Technology (Fintech) will be just some of the forces to shape the Canadian securities industry in the years ahead. The IIAC will monitor closely how the industry confronts these challenges and we look forward to sharing our observations in a future edition of this Chartbook.Click here to access the Chartbook.TweetOctober 25, 2019 by Ian RussellIIAC Congratulates the 2019 Investment Industry Hall of Fame Inductees, as well as the IIAC Top Under 40 Award Winner Devan LegareThe Investment Industry Association of Canada (IIAC) is proud to announce that last night at a gala dinner, five leaders of business were inducted into the Investment Industry Hall of Fame.“Last night, we paid tribute to five executives who have distinguished themselves through talent, leadership and integrity in Canada’s investment industry,” said Ian Russell, IIAC President and CEO. “Each one is a trailblazer whose contributions to the industry, the country and communities have set them apart.
