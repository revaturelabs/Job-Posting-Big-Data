The opportunities for progression and the access to training and other career support are one some of the things she thinks are best about working at the trust.“The trust saw my hard work and potential and rewarded me for it,” she says. “I’ve also had great opportunities for study, including a recent course at Kings College.”Working with a team of dedicated nurses is also one of the highlights of Eduarda’s job.“My team is amazing and we have a fantastic ward manager,” she says.As a junior sister on the ward, Eduarda assists with the day to day management of the ward. This includes organising the roster to ensure that the ward is adequately staffed, as well as helping oversee patient care and supporting more junior nursing staff.“Nursing is a hard job, but a beautiful one.”“Every day you have people’s lives in your hands, and they can be very unwell, but if you can make them smile at the end of the day, that’s the best reward you can have.”Eduarda’s message for anyone considering nursing is that it’s a fantastic job. And in particular, anyone who wants to come to the UK to start a nursing career should just go for it.“The only thing I regret so far is that I didn’t do it earlier!”Image: Eduarda Rodrigues, junior sisterENDSNotes to editorsMedia contacts: rf.mediaenquiries@nhs.net or call 020 7472 6665About the Royal Free London NHS Foundation TrustThe Royal Free began as a pioneering organisation and continues to play a leading role in the care of patients.
