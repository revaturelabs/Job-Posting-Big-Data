The industry designation is the primary one for the parent's operations overall. The totals are adjusted to account for the fact that each parent's entries may include both agency records and settlement announcements for the same case; or else a penalty covering multiple locations may be listed in the individual records for each of the facilities. They are also adjusted to reflect cases in which federal and state or local agencies cooperated and issued separate announcements of the outcome. Duplicate or overlapping penalty amounts are marked with an asterisk in the individual records list below.Top 10 Parent CompaniesTotal Penalty $Number of RecordsLafargeHolcim $281,553,918 642Saint-Gobain $153,468,428 143HeidelbergCement $132,229,089 671Weyerhaeuser $97,022,124 64Cemex $47,703,124 471CRH PLC $41,417,516 237Engineered Floors $33,317,008 11Boise Cascade $22,921,271 29Kohler $20,467,178 20JELD-WEN Holding $17,481,670 37Individual Penalty Records:Click on the company or penalty amount for more information on each case.
