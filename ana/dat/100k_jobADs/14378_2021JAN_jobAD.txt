Fair cooperation in mixed teams is part of our corporate culture and applies in the working world just as much as on the race track. Porsche therefore attaches great importance to equal treatment of women and men. Increasing the share of female employees is an important part of the Strategy 2018 as an initiative in the “Promotion of diversity” action area. The share of female employees has therefore been increased on all levels of the company in recent years. This development is supported by specific qualification and further training measures designed especially for women, e.g. in the form of workshops and seminars. Porsche also regularly organises exchange programmes for its forewomen and skilled female workers.For both women and men Porsche also offers flexible working hours models and locally-based childcare programmes to provide the ideal conditions for combining both work and family.Femtec and Girls‘ DayPorsche has taken part in the national Girls’ Day in Germany for over ten years now. Each year, interested girls from nearby secondary schools take up the invitation from Porsche and are given an exciting insight into technical professions and degree courses at various locations. The company also supports the initiative „Komm, mach MINT“ which inspires young women for technical studies.Our cooperation with Femtec has been in place since 2001. This is a career network to promote development of young female skilled employees and managers in engineering and scientific professions. Porsche offers young female engineers the opportunity to get to know Porsche during excursions and innovation workshops and also provides assistance in the form of internships and thesis projects.Diversity at PorschePorsche is a cosmopolitan company, with employees representing over 60 nationalities at its various sites. The desire for a corporate culture underpinned by diversity, internationality and equality means that Porsche also has a responsibility to protect its own employees from discrimination of any kind and in all stages of the employment.Porsche was awarded first place in the “Large enterprise” category of the state-wide competition “Success through diversity! – Training excellence for young migrants” in recognition of its efforts to promote cultural diversity among its trainees.At Porsche, equal opportunities do not apply only with respect to gender or origin, but particularly also include persons with disabilities. Porsche expressly welcomes applications from persons with disabilities and their integration is of particular importance to us.More aboutOur values and cultureCareer and familyFamiliarisation and development opportunitiesAttractive remuneration and additional benefitsPorsche health managementExcellent employerAreas of workJob Locator How to apply ContactBuild & FindBuild your PorscheCompare ModelsSearch Pre-OwnedOnline ServicesUsed Car LocatorDealersearchBehind the ScenesPassion MotorsportsPorsche ExperiencePorsche ClassicPorsche MuseumPorsche CompanyAt a GlanceResponsibilityJobs & CareersChristophorus - The Porsche MagazineShare PageFacebook Twitter Digg LinkedIn PinterestConnect with PorscheHOMEChange country/region:North America Latin America Europe Middle East Africa Asia Australia/OceaniaCanada (english) Canada (french) USA Argentina Bolivia Brazil Chile Colombia Costa Rica Dominican Republic Ecuador El Salvador Guadeloupe Guatemala Haiti Honduras Jamaica Mexico Panama Paraguay Peru Puerto Rico Trinidad & Tobago Uruguay Venezuela Other countries Austria Belarus Belgium Bosnia Bulgaria Croatia Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Finland France Georgia Germany Great Britain Greece Hungary Iceland Ireland Italy Lithuania Latvia Luxemburg Macedonia Malta Moldova Netherlands Norway Poland Portugal Russia Romania Serbia Slovakia Slovenia Spain Sweden Switzerland (German) Switzerland (French) Switzerland (Italian) Ukraine Other countries Abu Dhabi Bahrain Dubai Fujairah Israel Jordan Kuwait Lebanon Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia Sharjah Middle East (English) Middle East (French) Algeria Egypt Ghana Kenya La Reunion Morocco Mauritius Nigeria South Africa Tunisia Armenia Azerbaijan Turkey India Brunei Bangladesh Cambodia Indonesia Malaysia Mongolia Pakistan Philippines Singapore Sri Lanka Thailand Vietnam China (Mainland) Hong-Kong & Macau Japan Kazakhstan South Korea Taiwan Other countries/regions Australia French Polynesia New Caledonia New Zealand Other countries© 2021 Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG. Legal notice. Privacy Policy. Cookie Policy.* Data determined in accordance with the measurement method required by law. Since September 01, 2017 certain new cars have been type approved in accordance with the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), a more realistic test procedure to measure fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions. From September 01, 2018 the WLTP will replace the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Due to the more realistic test conditions, the fuel consumption and CO₂ emission values determined in accordance with the WLTP will, in many cases, be higher than those determined in accordance with the NEDC. This may lead to corresponding changes in vehicle taxation from September 01, 2018. You can find more information on the difference between WLTP and NEDC at www.porsche.com/wltp.Currently, we are still obliged to provide the NEDC values, irrespective of the testing method used. The additional reporting of the WLTP values is voluntary until their obligatory use. As far as new cars, which are type approved in accordance with the WLTP, are concerned, the NEDC values will therefore be derived from the WLTP values during the transition period. To the extent that NEDC values are given as ranges, these do not relate to a single, individual car and do not constitute part of the offer. They are intended solely as a means of comparing different types of vehicle. Extra features and accessories (attachments, tyre formats etc.) can change relevant vehicle parameters such as weight, rolling resistance and aerodynamics and, in addition to weather and traffic conditions, as well as individual handling, can effect the fuel consumption, electricity consumption, CO₂ emissions and performance values of a car.** Important information about the all-electric Porsche models can be found here."
