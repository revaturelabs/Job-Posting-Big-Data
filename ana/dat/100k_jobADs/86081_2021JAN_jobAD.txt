I cried out of happiness, overcoming, grit and desire to win.\"Things were never easy in my life, so why would they be now? The dream - no, the OBJECTIVE - is still alive. Congratulations for the performance, guys.\"The world's most expensive player, and making just his fourth appearance after breaking a bone in his foot in February, Neymar was the centre of attention for much of the match.Neymar copped plenty of flak.Late in the second half the referee awarded Brazil a penalty when he ruled Neymar had been brought down by a Costa Rican defender. But the VAR came into play and after viewing replays the referee overturned the decision and the spot kick was taken away, with Neymar deemed to have over-exaggerated the contact on him.BBC pundit Chris Sutton was critical of Neymar, saying something needed to be done to end the culture of diving in football.\"These players are trying to cheat and they are trying to gain an advantage for that, so why should they be allowed to play in the following game, because other teams are obviously disadvantaged?\" he said.Asked about Neymar's diving, former Socceroo John Kosmina said: \"That was a disgrace.\"Social media wasn't kind as plenty - including former England star Gary Lineker - slammed the 26-year-old for his Oscar-worthy dive.Neymar had a running battle with the referee for most of the match. The player constantly pleaded for sympathy while the official routinely told the PSG star to get on with it.According to reports, Neymar told the whistleblower: \"Don't touch me\" several times and also swore at him.Teammate Marcelo had to drag him away after he confronted the referee in the tunnel at half-time.Neymar's emotions at the end - breaking down in tears - highlighted Brazil's relief at getting its first win of the tournament after being held to 1-1 by Switzerland in their opening match.There is some concern in Brazil that his tears are a sign he may struggle to handle the pressure against tougher opposition as the tournament progresses.\"It's not normal to cry in the second game of a World Cup,\" Brazil's biggest newspaper, O Globo, said.\"A team needs to demonstrate mental strength, not fragility. Genuine or not, Neymar's crying is worrying.\"Coach Tite fell to the ground as he sped onto the pitch following Coutinho's strike.Neymar was overcome by emotion.- with AFPMore StoriesMighty continue to fall as Brazil struggleNeymar’s ‘extraordinary’ return as Utd star costs SpainSecret meaning of hand signals by Swiss playersMexico continues perfect World Cup streakHow Neymar killed Brazil's World Cup chancesShow MoreHeadlinesPremium Content Child forced to call triple-0 on abusive Maryborough mumCheeky try to sell ‘vintage’ Coon cheese packet21st Jan 2021 11:47 AMbrazil costa rica neymar philippe coutinho var world cupMore StoriesMighty continue to fall as Brazil struggleNeymar’s ‘extraordinary’ return as Utd star costs SpainSecret meaning of hand signals by Swiss playersMexico continues perfect World Cup streakHow Neymar killed Brazil's World Cup chancesShow MoreSubscriber ExclusivesPremium Content Drunk man smashes up shop to show off to friendsNews The Warwick man said he was acting ‘impulsively’ by kicking in a Palmerin St...Premium Content Inspirational rapper needs help to keep rollingNews Young rapper with a disability asking the public to lend a handPremium Content Property manager jailed for ripping off boss $60kCrime A property manager jailed for sipping off almost $60,000 from her boss says she...Premium Content WHAT’S ON: Australia Day events around MackayWhats On Your complete guide to everything happening on the Aussiest day of the year...21st Jan 2021 12:00 PMPremium Content The one legacy McGregor wants to leave behindBoxing Why the fight is still burning for the UFC’s most famous name21st Jan 2021 11:53 AMPremium Content SEE THE PICS: Truck driver recounts night he woke to flamesNews “It was only metres from the house, we were worried, we could have lost...Top StoriesPremium Content How to activate your free Courier Mail subscriptionSmarter Shopping We know you want the best of local news and we’re delivering, but did you know you can get even more – for free?Premium Content Worker in hospital after 4 metre construction fall21st Jan 2021 12:25 PMPremium Content PM slams quarantine camp idea21st Jan 2021 12:24 PMPolice shoot dead knife-wielding man21st Jan 2021 11:40 AMPremium Content Doctor found no sign of struggle on balcony murder accused21st Jan 2021 11:40 AMContact Full Site TopDigital AdvertisingAdvertising TermsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseView our other news sitesDaily NewspapersBundaberg News-MailFraser Coast ChronicleGladstone ObserverGrafton Daily ExaminerGympie TimesIpswich Queensland TimesLismore Northern StarMackay Daily MercuryRockhampton Morning BulletinSunshine Coast DailyToowoomba ChronicleWarwick Daily NewsCommunity NewspapersBig RigsBallina Shire AdvocateBalonne BeaconBlackwater HeraldCentral & North Burnett TimesBiloela Central TelegraphByron Shire NewsCaboolture NewsChinchilla NewsCoffs Coast AdvocateCoolum & North Shore NewsDalby HeraldEast-Ipswich SatelliteEmerald Central Queensland NewsGatton StarIpswich AdvertiserIsis Town and CountryLogan ReporterNoosa NewsThe Northern Rivers EchoRange NewsRural WeeklySouth Burnett TimesStanthorpe Border PostSuratBasin.com.auTweed Daily NewsCharleville Western TimesRoma Western StarWhitsunday TimesWhitsunday Coast Guardian© Gympie Times Pty Ltd 2021.
