The bottom line is that New Zealand needs skilled tradespeople to contribute to its development, and last year the Trades and Services industry was booming. It was among the fastest-growing industries on SEEK with a 16.9% increase in job opportunities. The industry recorded more than 3,400 new roles year-on-year and the average advertised salary was $59,646.Growth in this industry was driven primarily by the housing market in Auckland, with the city accounting for 9.4% of the total growth in job opportunities year-on-year.Roles advertised in Automotive Trades made up the biggest contribution to the overall growth in Trades & Services, with 3.7% growth in job opportunities year-on-year. This was followed by Labourers (2.5%) and roles in the Building Trades (2.3%).Demand for Trades and Services in New ZealandNew Zealand suffers from a significant skills shortfall in the Trades & Services industry and there is subsequently a strong demand for talented individuals across a number of roles. The current shortage amounts to around 60,000 workers in building and construction alone.The growth in job opportunities across Building Trades (2.3%) and Labouring (2.5%) was driven by the housing boom. New Zealand needs to continue to build more than 30,000 new homes each year if we are to keep up with rising demand. Half of the jobs shortfall is estimated to be for trades qualified workers. That translates into great opportunities for those considering construction as a career.In addition, the building and construction industry is becoming increasingly specialised, meaning that there are qualifications available for specialized trades, and plenty of scope for employment in these areas.The sector can be broken down into the following categories:Automotive tradesLabourersBuilding tradesTechniciansWelders & BoilermakersCarpentry & Cabinet MakingCleaning ServicesFitters, Turners & MachinistsGardening & LandscapingHair & Beauty ServicesNannies & BabysittersLocksmithsBakers & Pastry ChefsFor Visa Applicants: Roles on the Skills Shortages ListIf you are offered a job which appears on the list below, and you have the qualifications and experience to match, getting a work visa will be easier.
