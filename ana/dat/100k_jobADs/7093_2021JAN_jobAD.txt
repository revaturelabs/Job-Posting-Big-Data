Period. That's all there is to it.“Had we held those individuals in custody, or that one individual in custody pending a determination that this person should be allowed to remain in this country, that rape wouldn't have happened. We failed the citizens of this great nation by not securing the border.”Judd said that half of all illegal aliens are successfully breaking into the United States without capture due, in part, to policies that are demoralizing border agents:“Not only did we have the catch and release program that completely and totally demoralized the rank and file agents in the border patrol, but we also had an arrest rate of one out of every two. We only had a 50 percent effectiveness rate. That's a problem. So not only were the individuals that we were actually arresting, not only were we releasing those individuals, but we were only apprehending one out of every two that was crossing the border illegally.\"There’s no private company in the United States that can operate and be successful if they have a 50% success rate. They would go out of business.\"CNSNews Reader,The media are hard at work weaving a web of confusion, misinformation, and conspiracy surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.CNSNews covers the stories that the liberal media are afraid to touch.
