And it will support our ambition for Scotland to be a STEM nation with our economy at the forefront of the technological frontier.“The £2million funding from Scottish Enterprise also gives them access to the excellent business support network here in Scotland. And our communities will benefit from the work of the innovative SThree Foundation which supports young people from underprivileged and diverse backgrounds to transition successfully into STEM higher education, jobs and apprenticeships.”Alex Smith, SThree’s Chief Financial Officer, said:“Investing in Glasgow gives us access to a highly-skilled workforce and an excellent business infrastructure. The STEM markets in which we operate are growing rapidly and this new centre in Glasgow will strengthen our operational capability and support expanding teams across our main markets.“Our new Centre of Excellence will bring together our UK support services and underpin our future business needs in the most efficient way. In making this new investment in Glasgow, we have had tremendous support from the Scottish Government and SDI.”Paul Lewis, interim chief executive of Scottish Enterprise said:“It’s fantastic to see a company like SThree, with a strong focus on STEM industries, expanding in Scotland. That the company is planning to create 200 new jobs this year alone is a true endorsement of Scotland’s strength in these sectors, as evidenced by our growing reputation in areas like data, technology and R&D.“The decision by SThree to select Glasgow for this expansion is further evidence of Scotland’s attractiveness, backing up our position as the leading UK location for inward investment outside London, and we’re looking forward to working with the company to support its ambitious growth plans for Scotland.”Further details: https://news.gov.scot/news/jobShare this:TwitterFacebookEmailLinkedInRedditWhatsAppPublished by Gary PatersonView all posts by Gary Paterson	Posted in Constituency, NewsBy Gary Paterson	Leave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
