Bugger me, you lot are a bunch of .......Go back later, 5 miles on a set of tyres is not going to make that much difference.. unless you have left it too late to change them.If, for instance, you need 4. Ring 'em to make sure they have them, arrange the price and time, take it in. Simple.Got a puncture, drop it off after fitting your spare and pick it up later.QuoteLink to postShare on other sitesspermann 146Posted October 15, 2012spermannMF GuruRegulars1461,753 postsSharePosted October 15, 2012I tried National tyres today and I can see they have a lot of thumbs up from people on here - give them there due they where very busy but after standing in the office for 10 minutes awaiting somebody's attention and a further 5 minutes stood by the garage entrance being completely ignored I got in my car and drove off.A simple \"I'll be with you as soon as I can mate\" would have pacified meIt is saturday, not full staff and neal the boss is away,, hey are busy for a reason.Oh well that's ok then - when the boss is away everything falls to shit - Neal put your foot in your staffs arse and teach them some customer relation skills.You won't be busy if they are not capable of the basics of customer service.sure he will be gutted to lose such a polite customerI think he should be more gutted that he cannot trust anybody to look after his business while he is away - I own a lot more than 1 car and have 20 staff that also all drive, they will not be using this garage.Mainly down to you annoying me even more!So how long have you been associated with Island Exhaust Systems?QuoteLink to postShare on other sitessirstabby 9Posted October 15, 2012sirstabbyMF Senior MemberMembers9112 postsGender:MaleSharePosted October 15, 2012I also agree with national tyresBUTyou should buy the tyres online from tyre-shopper.co.uk first. They use national tyres on the IOM and they are a lot cheaper.1QuoteLink to postShare on other sitessideways 2Posted October 16, 2012sidewaysMF AddictedRegulars2993 postsGender:MaleLocation:at homeSharePosted October 16, 2012Still interested to know which firm gave the bad service up North ... bit unfair on the other Northern tyre companies who might be giving and excelent service..QuoteLink to postShare on other sitesPunisher 11Posted October 16, 2012PunisherMF Senior MemberMembers11207 postsGender:MaleAuthorSharePosted October 16, 2012 (edited)So how long have you been associated with Island Exhaust Systems?Never used them and nothing to do with them.

I think you should name and shame. I have to say that i personally have been using Northern Tyre and Exhausts since they opened a few years back, and have always found their prices to be at least 25% cheaper than the other one i used before. The lads are always friendly and polite, and always seen to know what they are doing.I assume you went back to the garage to complain, and point out the faults. What was their response?QuoteLink to postShare on other sitesmulokin 128Posted October 17, 2012mulokinMF Senior MemberRegulars128412 postsGender:MaleSharePosted October 17, 2012Northern Tyres welcome to the forum.QuoteLink to postShare on other sitesbillymacker 7Posted October 17, 2012billymackerMF Senior MemberMembers7101 postsLocation:shithole called ramseySharePosted October 17, 2012I have to say, it is a bit unfair tarring all the garages up north with the same brush.
