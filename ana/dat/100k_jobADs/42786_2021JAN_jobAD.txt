Like SWE, Keysight strives to support the success and advancement of women engineers in the workplace, and to empower and inspire our employees to reach their full potential, feel supported, be connected and inspired, and inspire others.Keysight has a long-standing relationship with the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), an organization that has been dedicated to helping women succeed in engineering and leadership since 1950.Throughout the seventies, local Hewlett-Packard sites engaged with SWE sections in their area. The relationship was expanded when HP sent a large delegation to the 1979 SWE National Conference in San Francisco, not far from HP headquarters. Among other things, the conference inspired HP to create the HP Women’s Technical Conference, which carried on for many years.In addition to focusing on employee development, HP, Agilent and now Keysight have also had a strong commitment to supporting SWE’s development of tomorrow’s STEM leaders and its focus on female collegiate engineering students.Keysight will be at the WE20 virtual conference in November. We’re hosting and participating in workshops and talking to attendees who are a good match for Keysight.Keysight at WE20Keysight will be at the virtual WE20 conference this year.

This award honors individuals who have driven international engineering, scientific and technology organizations, and served as role models to women engineers and technologists worldwide.Gail’s exceptional résumé of international achievements, global impact on business and employees, and extra-curricular leadership activities as a role model makes her highly deserving of this award. Her forty years with HP/Agilent/Keysight have taken her around the globe, touching nearly all aspects of business operations from product development and manufacturing to marketing and sales, to mention a few. Her first global assignment came early in her career when she jumped at the opportunity to move to South Queensferry, Scotland to become Keysight’s first female product line manager. After two years she returned to the U.S. to lead manufacturing engineering, customer support, and production planning. She then found herself in The Netherlands, directing the marketing for five product divisions in Europe, Middle East and Africa. She then moved to Hong Kong to duplicate in Asia her success in Europe. She started breaking down barriers and accelerating the impact marketing would have in the region.Back in the U.S., Gail became marketing manager for wireless test equipment…until she moved back to Asia to become General Manager in China, building high-performance R&D, product planning and product marketing teams in Beijing. After eight years in Asia, she was called on to lead a major acquisition in Spain. Now back in the U.S., Gail leads Keysight’s network of worldwide strategic partners.Gail’s courage to take on new challenges, ability to bring people together, continuous development of herself and others, and passion for diversity set her apart from the rest. She champions women in leadership by actively participating in company and external organizations that encourage diversity in business and engineering. She’s also a regular panelist at Keysight’s Women’s Leadership Panel, Keysight Leadership Network, and Emerging Leaders Program events, sharing her experiences as a leader. She has cofounded multiple organizations that promote the mentorship and development of women in business.Keysight Executives Praise SWEThe Keysight / SWE CommunityKeysight Contributes to Successful Expanding Your Horizons ProgramIn April, 2017, the 25th annual Sonoma County Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) event was held in Santa Rosa, CA.
