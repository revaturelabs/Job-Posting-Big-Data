A human child up to the age of six.”If you share Sir David Attenborough’s fascination with young minds and want to make a real difference in Sussex, tiney needs you - now.Our founding team revolutionised schools via Teach First - and now we’re giving the long-neglected early years sector the reinvention it desperately needs. How? By providing free, world-class training and support to a new generation of modern childminders, powered by a cutting-edge app created by some of the brightest minds in tech.We’re building a fast-growing community of brilliant early years educators - or tiney home leaders, as we prefer to call them, because this is a role where YOU’RE in charge - with an aim for there to be a tiney home around every corner. So far, we have dozens of micro-nurseries of all shapes and sizes (1 bedroom flat? No problem. We can help you make it work) opening up across London and the home counties, but we would love to put yours on the map.Some of our existing community of fantastic tiney childminders come from backgrounds as diverse as teaching, acting, dentistry, care work, fashion, floristry, business and beyond, but they’re all united by a passion for learning through play and a desire to give children the start in life that they deserve.You’ll be self-employed, but without the boring bits - our app takes care of the admin - and some of our most successful tiney home leaders are bringing home over 40K a year.Covid has shone a light on the benefits of small, bubble-style home-based settings, so now is a great time to join the community (and we can have you up and running in under 3 months!). It’s a job with flexibility; a job where you get to continually grow thanks to our ongoing professional development and one-to-one support; a job that can save money on childcare if you have little ones of your own; a job where you have creative control over your day. Above all, it’s a job where you get to change lives - from your living room.
