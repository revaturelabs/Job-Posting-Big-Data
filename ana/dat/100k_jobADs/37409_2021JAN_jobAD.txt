Document Printing Progress, a K3b CD burning dialogue, Audio Encoding via KAudioCreator, File Transfers in Konqueror, Kopete, KTorrent, checking email in KMail… The new Jobs support in KDE 4 will unify the display of progress for these tasks, making it easy to see and manage what is happening on your system. Read on for details.About The AuthorEugenia LoliEx-programmer, ex-editor in chief at OSNews.com, now a visual artist/filmmaker.Follow me on Twitter @EugeniaLoli21 Comments2007-01-24 7:06 pmanda_skoa	For those not actually reading the article (yes I mean youThe developer knowns about similar projects, for example a GNOME project named Mathusalem, and is interested in developing an interoperable solution once he knows which requirement the KDE side will have.Again one of the times where one can see how nicely D-Bus allows a service oriented approach on desktop systems.2007-01-24 7:39 pmlostnerd	Preemptive strike on trolls, huh?2007-01-24 8:17 pmanda_skoa	Preemptive strike on trolls, huh?Lets call it an “educational hint”2007-01-24 8:19 pmlostnerd	I see. I stand corrected.2007-01-24 8:52 pmanda_skoa	No no, you’re right too. It is an intended side effect2007-01-24 7:38 pmlostnerd	Interesting concept, love to see the final implementation. I will officially support listing this as a must have feature for KDE4.2007-01-24 8:07 pmborker	some of the feature ideas for KDE4 are coming out of the various kde-*.org sites that had sections for posting feature ideas, mock-ups etc for KDE4. Nice for the non-developers out there to see their ideas turned into working code.2007-01-24 10:00 pmari-free	but I will continue to bash kde as long as they keep those vertical tabs. I hate turning my head to read them2007-01-25 6:19 amnii_	Yeah, even though English text is written left to right normally, there is no need to put characters on their side when writing from top to bottom. Afterall, all the 26 characters and 10 numbers are taught to be viewed from just one direction.The following is easy to read:D <– downwards text with standing charactersOW – A C R O S SNWARDS2007-01-25 10:16 amCarewolf	Are you kidding? That’s much harder to read that if you had turned the letters.2007-01-25 10:52 amdagw	Come on, neither of the two are in any way hard. And it’s not like you’ll be reading a novel that way. It’s a few words.2007-01-24 10:15 pmJohn Nilsson	I get the impression that the tasks and jobs talked about here are the tasks and jobs of the computer. Which is nice and all to keep track of.What about the users tasks and jobs? Ever since I read the GTD[1] book I’ve been intrigued by the possibility of a desktop fokused on “getting things done” rather than “looking like an office”.So this is kind of a heads up, if you’re into designing thigs for desktops, take a look at the book and see if there’s soemthing to learn.[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done2007-01-24 10:46 pmBobe	I agree with you. I think a focus on “getting things done” would be nice for any desktop environment (and I believe a lot of environments have already implemented features to do just that).However, I hated that book you linked to. I realize that the author had about 20 pages worth of stuff to say and a hundred+ pages to fill, but still…I got about half way through the thing and came to the realization that I didn’t care about the author, his “amusing” anecdotes, or anything else he had to say. I left it on the train for somebody else who may like that sort of thing.2007-01-24 10:50 pmzombie process	Yeah, after buying the book and CDs, I can say with certainty that I got just as much out of the CDs as I did the book. Still, it’s the bible of time management for many folks. Time Management for System Administrators was a much more relevent book for me – I don’t have a calendar full of meetings, but I do have more to do in a day than I can possibly finish, and have no way to “plan” for the remaining issues that always come up.Edited 2007-01-24 22:512007-01-24 11:05 pmJohn Nilsson	While I recoginze that most desktops have “features” to help get things done. The overall design of those features could do better wrt to actual affordances at getting things done.One shift would be to go from file/window/workspace managing to task/project mangament f.ex.The computer should really be more your personal secretary rather than your personal desktop mess.Regarding the book I agree that it could probably be condenced a bit, but really even with the filling it’s only 250 pages2007-01-25 2:21 amanda_skoa	What about the users tasks and jobs?While this is currently applied to jobs the computer is processing for your, the general design is capable of representing any kind of job.Basically this is what Rafael has worked on lately, i.e. taking the concept of “jobs” to a new abstraction level.2007-01-24 10:46 pmzombie process	This looks very sweet. I’m really looking forward to kde4 – I already absolutely love kde, and it looks like it’s just going to keep getting better!2007-01-25 8:53 amREMF	as usual; “can’t wait”.2007-01-25 3:04 pmSavior	Looks nice. However, how will it work with regard to file copying? They say it depends on DBUS; I just don’t know how “deep” it is. If I select 100 files in Krusader / Konqueror, and copy it, will it spawn 100 processes? Or will it spawn just one?In the former case, it will be close to useless. If they can manage this, however, it will rock!2007-01-25 3:10 pmanda_skoa	If you select multiple files for copying or moving in Konqueror, it creates one copy job for the whole operation, i.e. copying one file after the other until it is finised.You can easily check for yourself, because now you only get one progress dialog.The feature discussed in this article is about allowing different forms of job visualizations, not about changing the way jobs work.2007-01-25 4:06 pmSavior	The feature discussed in this article is about allowing different forms of job visualizations, not about changing the way jobs work.Yes, I understood that much. I also thought that it is already one job, just needed someone to confirm it.OSnews AccountRegisterLog inRSS (Articles)RSS (Comments)Support OSnewsOSnews PatreonSupport OSnewsTopicsTopics Select Category .NET (311) 3D (183) Academic OSes (12) AMD (166) Amiga & AROS (401) Android (337) Apple (1,663) Benchmarks (134) BeOS & Derivatives (370) BSD & Darwin (193) Bugs & Viruses (94) Comics (37) Databases (180) Debian (286) Editorial (204) Fedora Core (246) FreeBSD (445) Games (496) Geek stuff (104) General Development (1,420) Gentoo (85) Gifts, Contests (38) Gnome (378) Google (840) Graphics (312) GTK+ (100) Hardware (1,124) Humor (80) IBM (249) In the News (591) Intel (323) Internet (777) Internet Explorer (181) Java (531) KDE (433) Legacy OSes (15) Legal (944) Linspire (190) Linux (2,189) Mac OS X (993) Mandriva, Mandrake, Lycoris (432) Microsoft (973) Mobile (37) Mono (152) Morphos (129) Mozilla, Gecko (408) Multimedia, AV (294) NetBSD (182) Novell and Ximian (200) Office (321) Open Source (392) OpenBSD (186) OpenStep, GNUstep (54) Opera (145) Oracle and SUN (492) Original OSNews Interviews (161) OS News (1,226) OS/2 (140) PC-BSD (67) Podcasts (47) Privacy, Security (559) QNX (76) Qt (179) ReactOS (110) Red Hat (351) RISC OS (171) Rumors (269) SCO (105) SGI and IRIX (63) SkyOS (131) Slackware, Slax (109) Solaris (340) Sponsor (3) SuSE, openSUSE (308) Syllable, AtheOS (134) Ubuntu (433) Unix (198) Web 2.0 (19) Window Managers (145) Windows (2,564) Wireless (1,474) X11 (193) Xfce (62) Zeta (132)Related PostsKommando: a Floating Panel for KDE	January 27, 2008	• 8 Comments	Making the Switch from ‘the Blue’ to ‘the Green’	May 4, 2004	• 56 Comments	New Qt releases possibly restricted to paying customers for 12 months, KDE not particularly happy	April 8, 2020	• 37 Comments	KDE 3.1.1 Released	March 20, 2003	• 27 Comments	KDE 3.0.3 Released	August 19, 2002	• 4 Comments	Popular PostsLet’s do something dumb: can we turn a SPARC server into a SPARC workstation?
