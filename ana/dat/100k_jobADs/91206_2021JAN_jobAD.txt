The school is reportedly situated very near to Chelsea‚Äôs Cobham training centre.The Northern Irishman was sacked from the managerial job at Liverpool early in October after a disappointing run of form and the 1-1 draw against Merseyside rivals Everton proved to be the final nail in the coffin. Subsequently, former Borussia Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp was appointed as the club‚Äôs manager.On the other hand, Chelsea is going through one of the most onerous seasons since their emergence as a top club. The defending champions, who lost just three matches in the 2014/15 Premier League campaign, have already been defeated seven times this season and lie just a couple of places above the relegation zone.This is the first time since October 1999 that Chelsea have lost three league matches on the trot. Blues manager Jose Mourinho‚Äôs job is hanging by a thread and after every defeat the team suffers, there is speculation of him being ousted from the club.Rodgers has managed Chelsea academy and reserve teamsBrendan Rodgers‚Äô previous stint with Chelsea came when he was a youth coach at Reading and Mourinho called him to join the Chelsea Academy as their head youth coach in 2004. The 42-year-old remained in charge of the Chelsea academy for two years, after which he was elevated to the post of Chelsea‚Äôs reserve team manager. He managed the reserve team under Avram Grant and Luiz Felipe Scolari as well.The North Ireland native was touted to take the job of Chelsea‚Äôs caretaker manager a couple of days back if they don‚Äôt find a more accomplished manager at the end of the season, according to reports on The Express.However, according to Mirror, there are two other possible clubs, who are established in the vicinity of the area he was spotted in where Rodgers might possibly go to ‚Äì Championship sides Fulham and Queens Park Rangers. The clubs are undergoing serious managerial problems of their own. But Rodgers may not want to manage a Championship club again, after he helped Swansea City become the first Welsh team to gain promotion to the Premier League, back in 2011.It will be interesting to see if Chelsea approach Rodgers to take the role of a caretaker manager at a club where he spent four years from 2004 to 2008. He was spotted by some football fans in London as well, and they posted pictures of the ex-Liverpool manager on twitter.AdvertisementSpotted: Brendan Rodgers at Waterloo, dressed very smartly.
