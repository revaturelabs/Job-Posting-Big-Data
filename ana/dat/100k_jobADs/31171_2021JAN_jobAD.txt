HeliMods has received assistance through the Palaszczuk Government's Jobs and Regional Growth Fund. Picture: Patrick Woods.He said they hoped to also boost exports into Europe within the next five to 10 years.\"Last year 40 per cent of our revenue was from exports … this year exporting has been affected, but my aim is to see that we re-emerge through this even better,\" he said.He said the expansion would be at their current facility at Caloundra, but added they were keen to explore opportunities in the future to create more industry within the area.Without the government funding he said the expansion could have taken seven to 10 years.The government is yet to release details of the value of the funding from the Jobs and Regional Growth Fund, due to discussions still being under way around project conditions.In December last year the company also won support from the Federal Government, to help reach new opportunities in global markets.Defence Industry Minister Melissa Price announced the business received $150,000 under the Defence Global Competitiveness Grants program.The funding was used to purchase plant and equipment to manufacture large machined components used in the modification and upgrade of military and paramilitary helicopters.More StoriesPremium Content 150 industries in line for Olympic-sized jobs boomToday's headlines: Rail outrage and pilot's survival storyPremium Content 12 of the Coast’s quirkiest side hustle businessesPremium Content Major property player to pump $2.5b into CBDMore StoriesPremium Content 150 industries in line for Olympic-sized jobs boomToday's headlines: Rail outrage and pilot's survival storyPremium Content 12 of the Coast’s quirkiest side hustle businessesPremium Content Major property player to pump $2.5b into CBD0business expansionRead MoreLogin to followhelimodsRead MoreLogin to followqueensland government fundingRead MoreLogin to followsunshine coast business communityRead MoreLogin to followbusiness expansion helimods queensland government funding sunshine coast business communitySubscriber ExclusivesPremium Content Fears parking woes will worsen with new childcare centreCouncil News Residents say a street where parking is so elusive some place witches hats outside their homes is not the ideal location for a new childcare centre.Premium Content ‘Absolute dream’: Jungle Love’s triumphant returnNews The director of popular music festival Jungle Love has confirmed it will make a return this year after the pandemic shut down last year’s event.Premium Content Hastings St, beachfront homes at ‘high risk’ of rising seaEnvironment The best protection from sea rises could be levees that would need to be built in the near future.1Premium Content Coast hot spots most resistant to COVID vaccineHealth Parts of the Coast known for low vaccination rates could pose a problem for the rollout of the COVID-19 immunisation plan, health experts warn.Premium Content Third time’s a charm for Sebel’s new ownerProperty A Noosa businessman has beaten a host of high quality submissions from experienced operators to snap up the Sebel Pelican Waters on his third attempt.Premium Content Flippin’ cool penguin encounter makes a splashFamily Fun Sunshine Coast families will soon be able to waddle straight into the penguin pen at a major aquarium after the launch of a new interactive encounter.Just InPremium Content ‘Plenty out there’: Sharp showers to hang around20th Jan 2021 10:20 AMBizarre display in Trump’s final hours20th Jan 2021 10:19 AMPremium Content Ex-Palm mayor's $100K fraud case delayed20th Jan 2021 10:13 AMPremium Content Woman stabs man in overnight attack20th Jan 2021 10:00 AMPremium Content Company boss slashes Merc’s tyres in domestic violence rage20th Jan 2021 10:00 AMPremium Content Health expert debunks COVID vaccine concern20th Jan 2021 10:00 AMJust InPremium Content Woman hospitalised after falling in hole at CQ Uni20th Jan 2021 9:28 AMDad traps man accused of raping daughter20th Jan 2021 9:44 AMPremium Content One person hospitalised after reported gas leak20th Jan 2021 9:23 AMPremium Content 'One day to go': Two cases on eve of restriction decisionTop StoriesPremium Content Coast coach empowers women through surfingHealth A Sunshine Coast surfer’s game-changing coaching sessions are helping women improve their mental health as they learn to surf.20th Jan 2021 9:02 AMPremium Content Man’s good Samaritan act costs him his licenceOffbeat Man caught drink driving after helping police move fallen tree off road20th Jan 2021 9:00 AMPremium Content Coast rental price surge leaves locals scramblingProperty Rents on the Sunshine Coast are rising at faster rate than Gold CoastPremium Content Osteopath jailed for raping client on treatment tableCrime An osteopath who raped his long-term client plans a big move© Sunshine Coast Newspaper Company Pty Ltd 2021.
