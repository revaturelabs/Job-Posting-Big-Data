Outdoor enthusiasts come here to ski, hike, canoe and fish; trout and small-mouth bass fishing is among the best in the U.S. Mountains surround the city, and the tapestry of golds and reds on an autumn day is breathtaking. The city is dominated by an elaborate 10-building complex that includes the State Capitol; the New York State Museum, with life-like dioramas such as American Indian life and an Adirondack logging operation; and the oval-shaped Empire State Performing Arts Center, nicknamed \"The Egg.\" History buffs will enjoy the colonial homes, historic churches and museums, and can tour 18th-century mansions, like the Schuyler, a superb example of pre-Revolutionary War architecture. Whether nature or history is your passion, you'll find an abundance of both in this upstate New York gem.NurseFly rates working as a travel nurse in Albany, NY as a 62 out of 100.View the Albany, NY city guideAbout Trinity Health FirstChoiceChoose your own schedule.
