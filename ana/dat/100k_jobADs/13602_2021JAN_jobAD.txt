(I was doing it backwards.) As I worked with Kit, things began to come together very quickly and suddenly I had job interviews for positions I really wanted.” – Judith Harlan“Kit -You are one of a kind to me, and I would highly recommend you as the best in the world at helping floundering (not to mention older!) job and career seekers such as myself to find their way! . . . She has a rare and refreshing knack for guiding you through your job search process, while giving you just enough feedback, and interjecting just the right information, using her incredible wealth of knowledge. All this will gets you right where you need to be. Kit, I can never thank you enough for what you did for me!! – Kathy Watson, Reno, Nevada“Kit did an amazing job supporting me through my career/life change into my dream job. Her natural ebullience and genuine concern for me and my quest really helped keep me focused and energized. Kit’s contacts within the community were also extremely helpful resources. Without her expertise and guidance I wouldn’t have come so far so fast. I would recommend career counseling, and Kit in particular, to anyone needing a career boost. She was invaluable. Thanks, Kit!!” – Laura Conrow“Kit Prendergast is a joy to work with. She’s extremely upbeat, positive and encouraging. She guided me intuitively and wisely to discover my career path. She worked hard to help me develop and keep focused on my goals. I would recommend her highly to anyone seeking a career coach. She is truly inspirational.” - Laura Howcroft“Wanted you to know how much I appreciated the call, Kit. It’s funny that all of a sudden the resistance leads to mulling it over and that to consideration and then, realization: ‘Gee that’s terrible; that’s not the me I want to be.’ The recognition of the habit or disorder or whatever we call it – just recognition of the issue and giving it a name the client/patient can “get”. This is a work in progress. Thanks for showing me the path” - Peggy McGrawWhat are 5 strengths you have as a coach?10+ years experience & certification in career & life coachingExtensive experience as a psychotherapist with people in transitionAn ability to motivate, engage and move people forward quicklyAn unwavering belief in the gifts that individuals bring to their work & livesA sense of humor and perspective that inspires and energizesWhat is your coaching philosophy?Powerful partnerships for powerful results. It’s very difficult to make significant career and life changes alone. We all need to have that partner that really believes in us. A person that helps us clarify what we really want in this next chapter of our lives and then with wisdom, the right questions and with a touch of humor actively moves us forward. So if you are ready to create a new future for yourself, then partnering with me may be just what you need to move your dreams ahead today – not tomorrow.What types of people do you typically coach?Individuals in all three phases of career transition (exploring, active search, first 90 days)People seeking further understanding of their transferable skills, talents & knowledgeIndividuals seeking to master EQ skills for job security & career advancementLeaders committed to engaging & motivating their teamsManagers & HR professionals wishing to learn coaching skillsWhat is your professional background?32 years experience working in personal and career transitionsICF Professional Certified Coach (PCC) (International Coach Federation)Certified Career Management Coach (Career Coach Academy)Certified Life Coach (Institute for Life Coach Training)Certified \"'Now What?\"' Life Blueprint\" Facilitator (InterCoach, Inc.)Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) Instructor (Type Resources)Mentor Coach in small business development and advanced coaching skillsExperienced corporate trainer and customized curriculum developerInternational cross-cultural work while living and working in Norway for six yearsPrior Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) in Nevada, Virginia and CaliforniaPrevious psychotherapist for Kaiser Permanente HMO (East & West coasts)How can clients get started working with you as their coach?Order Online through our secure checkout: Click one of the Add to Cart buttons belowOrder by Phone: Call our ordering department toll free at 888-491-8833You will then be directly contacted by the head of the coaching program to select the right coach for you.Career Coaching ProgramsService What You Get Price Add to CartThree 30-Minute Coaching Sessions The Career Coaching service matches individuals with a personal coach--a confidant, champion, and challenger who will help you:Gain personalized guidance through job transitionsPrepare and navigate through your annual reviewsLeverage your behavioral and professional strengths effectivelyDiagnose reasons for career dissatisfactionLearn how to take action in networking, interviewing, and taking on new opportunitiesWith Career Coaching you can:Learn how your behavioral style affects those you work withBuild a compelling value proposition for a potential employerManage change more effectivelyOvercome hurdles that impede successSustain professional success and maintain balanceGet ongoing support through all phases of your careerMember: $224.00Non Member: $280.00ErrorCloseContinuePowered ByYou do not have JavaScript Enabled on this browser.
