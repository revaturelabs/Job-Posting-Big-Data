Adecco competes globally with its rivals Randstad, ManpowerGroup (NYSE :), as well as local staffing companies, which are experiencing major labor market shifts triggered by the pandemic. Many companies that refrained from cutting jobs last year will launch restructuring campaigns in the first half of this year, Christophe Catoir, president of the Adecco brand, which places temporary and permanent workers, told Reuters. ‚ÄúBy 2021, you will see a difficult impact on hiring administrative staff,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe restructuring has started in the fourth quarter of 2020 and will run through the first and second quarters of this year.‚Äù We haven‚Äôt reached the bottom of the pool yet, ‚Äúsaid Catoir, who is on the Adecco board.‚Äù In 25 years. I have never seen so much uncertainty. ‚ÄúIn its November third quarter results, Adecco Group reported a 15% drop in revenue compared to the previous year, although the company said it was seeing gradual improvement as it reopened its businesses. By 2021, Catoir expects there to be a marked decrease in the availability of permanent placements for white-collar professionals in areas such as payroll administration, financial control and other corporate functions. This will be replaced by an increase in temporary hiring, he said. that companies prefer to remain flexible. ‚Äù Although each wave of the virus is less shocking than the last, companies are weaker than before, ‚ÄúCatoir said, which means they will suspend permanent hiring for the time being.Disclaimer: Fusion Media wishes to remind you that the data contained on this website is not necessarily accurate or in real time.
