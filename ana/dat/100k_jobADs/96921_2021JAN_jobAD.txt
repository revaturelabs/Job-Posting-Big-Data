This process will generally begin with an initial screening interview held over the phone with a representative from the HR department. This first interview will include questions regarding your prior work experience, availability, and salary expectations.A successful phone interview will often be followed up with a request to attend a face-to-face interview. Companies like ASL Belgium will either hold their face-to-face interviews in a one-on-one format, as a group or panel.ASL Belgium Assessment CentreAssessing job applicants is turning into a more complicated business than it was just a few years ago. Employers think that merely testing and interviewing job candidates are not enough to draw appropriate and just conclusions about their personalities, professional skills, and future performance at work. The Assessment Centre allows deeper and more multifaceted evaluation of job candidates because it offers more than testing and interviewing. During an assessment event, job candidates are involved in many activities; they deliver oral presentations, participate in group and simulation exercises, take part in case studies, and play different roles assigned to them by assessors. While they are so engaged, applicants are being watched and evaluated. Assessors give points to job applicants at every stage of their assessment and eliminate those who look less professional and charismatic by comparison to other candidates. Those who reach the final stage of the assessment have an opportunity to demonstrate their personality and professional traits to their employers in a face-to-face interview. If they create a favourable impression on their interviewers, job applicants may receive a job offer.How Is the Verbal Test Scored?The Verbal Reasoning Test is evaluated not according to the number of correct answers that you get on it. Your score on the test is estimated against the scores of other applicants who are also taking it or those who already work in the positions similar to yours. Employers prefer this method of scoring on the Verbal Reasoning Test because it allows them to choose the top candidate from the pool of applicants. Yet this method can be the bad news for candidates themselves. It is more difficult to withstand the competition when your results are calculated relative to the scores received by others. Even an objectively high score may look comparatively low if all other test results are higher. Your 89% of correct answers will not open you the door to a face-to-face interview if your peers got 90% of answers right. Do not hurt your chances of qualifying for the desired position by not preparing for your Verbal Reasoning Test. Purchase our exclusive PrepPack™ and outshine other job applicants.What Can I Expect on the SJT?There are four primary categories: Knowledge, skills and performance; Safety and quality; Communication, partnership and teamwork; and Maintaining Trust. The scenarios aim to place you in the shoes of an employee with an impeccable record both in terms of work ethics and as a problem solver. As the test progresses the work situations become more complicated as do the possible solutions.Why Do Companies Ask Applicants to Take the Numerical Reasoning Test?Many companies ask their job candidates to take the Numerical Reasoning Test as a part of their hiring process because they want to evaluate how well their prospective employees understand and analyze numerical data. Most of the positions require working with numbers; employers, therefore, make an effort to ascertain that job applicants can perform at least basic numerical operations such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. The Numerical Reasoning Test is a reliable evaluation of applicants’ numerical skills and utilized by many companies. If you want to succeed in your pre-employment assessment, practice with our Numerical Tests designed to increase your chances of becoming employed.What to Expect In a Phone Interview?A phone interview is usually the first stage in a company’s hiring process. After your résumé and cover letter have been screened, you will get a phone from the company’s Human Resources manager who will talk to you about your educational background and work experience. Expect to answer questions about the information you put on your résumé. The Human Resources manager may also tell you about the company, its structure, and benefits you will get if you are hired.What Should I Do to Get a Job Offer?Pre-employment tests are becoming more and more difficult. Coming to them unprepared almost certainly guarantees that you will flunk them. To get a job offer, you must prepare in advance for your test and interviews. And it is better to get professional help with your preparation. JobTestPrep aims to defend you against failure and offers you the help you need. We have developed sophisticated practice materials that include tests most closely modelled on a company’s official tests, drills, study guides, and answer keys. Furthermore, we have added to our PrepPacks™ interview preparation materials to ensure that you impress your potential managers not only with high test results but also with your confidence during the interview. Purchase our helpful resources and start moving the company’s business forward.How Many References Should I Give to My Employers?References are important and may influence your employers’ hiring decision. It is, therefore, advisable to think of people who can recommend you for an applied position in advance. Make sure also to list people who will truly put in a good word for you rather than tell neutral, insignificant facts about you. As a rule, listing three people will be enough for most of the recruiters. If you are applying for a managerial position, add two or three more people to your list of references. And do not forget to list them in the order of importance.How Long Is the Assessment Day?The duration of the assessment day varies. The assessment event can be as short as a couple of hours and as long as two days. If applicants are required to stay overnight and have a second assessment day, they will be provided with accommodation and food. Some companies also reimburse job candidates for travel expenses.ASL Belgium and other trademarks are the property of their respective trademark holders.
