ORCA is committed to the study of cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) and promoting their conservation through enthusing, inspiring and educating others.We believe that if we can help someone experience seeing wild whales and dolphins then theyâ€™ll become as passionate about them as us. To this end, we have dedicated Wildlife Officers on board ferries in UK and Europe over the summer months, running talks, activities and deck watches, enthusing about the astonishing marine wildlife on our doorstep.We also undertake monthly surveys on ferries and cruise ships throughout the summer, using volunteer Marine Mammal Surveyors who record the species seen, their whereabouts and activity, so we can help conservation by providing our data to other conservation charities, governments and students. You can help by training as a volunteer or becoming a member.Website: www.orcaweb.org.ukDirectory sectors: environmental education, marine conservationDo MoreSave this profileTweet this profileShare this profileSend to a friendÃ—Hey, donâ€™t be a stranger!Receive our weekly job update â€“ sent to over 94,000 subscribers every Monday evening ðŸ˜€AdvertiseAdvertise & Rates Testimonials Advance Purchase Register / Sign inJob seekerJob seeker Making your application count Register / Sign inGeneralAbout us BlogConnectFollow us on twitter Like us on Facebook Join our groupWeekly jobs update sign-upContactWorking Planet Limited18 Southernhay WestExeterEX1 1PJ01392 491578 [email protected]"
