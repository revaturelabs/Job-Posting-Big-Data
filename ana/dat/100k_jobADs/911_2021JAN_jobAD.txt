Pliner Company against Pliner and wifeTop Public Relations News:Former Congressman and MWW PR employee – still sextingAnthony Weiner, whose name has become synonymous with sexting appears to continue his bad habits, despite the massive consequences he’s faced for it in the last couple of years. Since he’s a bit of a PR expert – from long before his personal scandal – he should look at the problem and recognize it for what it is – addiction and get into treatment. Even if he doesn’t see it as that, he would probably be well-advised to get into treatment to show he’s willing to turn things around.Weiner, married to top Hillary aide, Huma Abedin, was hired by MWWPR last year. During the time he was there, The NY Post is claiming he was sexting. Weiner’s response, “Are you asking me if I met with people while I worked at a government-relations/P.R. company? Of course, I did. I even met with New York Post reporters I’m sure. My job was to buy people lunches and drinks, etc.”Shift Communications becomes Rockport’s new AORMassachusetts footwear brand, Rockport, is considered to be the investor of the walking shoe and operating for 45 years.
