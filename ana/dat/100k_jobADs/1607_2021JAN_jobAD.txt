I thought if you had the class mark item for a specific class, you could change into it.Slow leveling doesn't seem to be unusual. From my experience so far, character classes might gain a level every other map or so. And, I think around level 5, you'll start to have access to better weapons and armor for each of your classes.In addition to warriors and archers, I got a wizard and a healer when I got that first wave of units given to me by the duke. There have definitely been more available for recruitment in each town. So, if you don't have enough diversity of unit types, maybe recruit some other ones?The GWJ JRPG Club 2.IV Remastered: Let Us Grind Together! | BacklogMr GT ChrisPosted: July 12, 2019 10:58 PMPermalinkTake my yen!Osaka, JapanHardek wrote:So I’m not sure if I’m doing something wrong...My characters are all like level 5 and none are capable of switching class yet (they do not meet the stat requirements).

As LastSurprise said, as long as you have the class mark item you can change to any class.

At least, according to Wikipedia.The GWJ JRPG Club 2.IV Remastered: Let Us Grind Together! | BacklogMr GT ChrisPosted: July 13, 2019 2:39 AMPermalinkTake my yen!Osaka, JapanI just read up on the PS1 version.https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards...PSP, hands down.This isn't a mere 'port' of the original game, they've completely reworked the mechanics (mostly for the better) and added vast amounts of additional side-content. The translation work's also much cleaner. This is coming from someone who adores the SNES version, mind (PSX has horrendous loadtimes and really is just a port, and a bad one at that; stay away from that one).So sounds like you’re definitely on the other game as the PS1 and PSP games are not that fundamentally different.SundownPosted: July 13, 2019 9:23 PMPermalinkMoon to goDallas, TXDone with Law Ch. 3!I really haven't mixed up the classes much in this game, unlike in something like FFT where it almost encourages you to try out the new and crazy things it throws at you. Instead, my main tactic of having a couple of knights plus a fighter clog up an intersection while my now 3 archers (and 2 mages) lay waste to everything has gotten me pretty far.Now for story stuffSpoiler:I kept expecting a huge twist at some point by GT Chris' comments outside of the spoiler, but the chapter just kept going and going in a seemingly straightforward way. We took some rearguard castle, then marched and took the real castle while we and the enemy swapped bases, then we took ours back and won. I was surprised at that as well when it kept going and going after logical endpoints. But, it seems like this victory wasn't the main point of this chapter, so in a sense it makes sense that the chapter didn't end with our victory, because our victory didn't matter in the grand scheme of things. What really mattered was Catiua's reveal to Denam.I was actually lost a bit at that story beat and didn't get the importance at the time, so I went back and watched the intro cutscene for the first time. Now I had a better sense of the factions, and more importantly why Catiua becoming princess is so important to the story; the clans battling it out for supremacy could never hope to have a claim to the crown as soon as she stepped forward. Hence why the Ch.4 cutscene said that the battles between the Walister and Galgastani would be left out of the history books. It renders any battles for the throne before irrelevant, and in its own way emphasizes the view that the lives and deaths of individuals can matter little in the grand schemes of power and politics.As for predictions for the upcoming chapter, I have to imagine we do fight Catiua at some point, but I don't see that she is some final enemy. That's more likely Lancelot the Dark Knight. There might also be more rebellions against Denam as more of his fighters split off since there is a new official ruler. The start of the chapter has us going to one such uprising, and I expect more. And we may have to put some down and risk being branded a villain.We got two separate warnings in Ch.3 about bewaring the chase for power and how toppling tyrants only makes us the next target to be toppled, and in a game like this, I don't think that is going to be an offhand comment.Switch: 2784-7157-5113LastSurprisePosted: July 14, 2019 12:01 PMPermalinkThou hast acquired a new tagUgh.

One problem I have, with the way that class levelling works, I feel uncomfortable taking more than one of any class into a battle because I feel like I'm leaving xp on the table and I want to have as many viable classes as possible. So, at most I have 2 archers and 2 clerics but I leave them behind if the party size goes less than 10 for a battle. Also, I always have at least 1-2 spectators every battle, basically the latest new classes I've picked up, levelling them up until I can actually use them. I'm at the point now where I literally have 2 spectators and 2 classes that are barely viable (4-5 levels below the enemy). So many cool classes that I have to try them all! One class I just picked up is the Fusal (firearms) class, so hopefully that can replace one of my archers.

I knew leaving her behind was a bad idea Denam! She's the only Priest!I was actually surprised that the Dark Knights didn't just dump Brantyn immediately but actually seemed to fulfil their duty to him. But I need to remember that they are literally an outside force in a foreign land and not necessarily a huge army at that so it doesn't make sense to cut their only remaining ally. Also, poor Oz, I didn't even intend to kill him. I just assumed he'd teleport out but nope... I wonder if the other Dark Knight leader (forgot his name) was also killable in that battle. But after I killed Oz he retreated.Previously I recruited the blind swordsman who seemed to be an associate of Ozma and we get cut scenes to that effect suggesting a relationship between the two of them. I was thinking that Ozma might even be recruitable but now Oz is dead so...Two other characters you can recruit in Ch 3 Law, Ravness, and Jenounes. Ravness, especially is quite convoluted and I missed her the first time I played Law. Jenounes is more straight forward but a seemingly innocuous conversation choice can miss the chance. Jenounes is a Dragoon which is super useful because it has a Monster Strike and a Dragon Strike special ability (40/50TP). Instead of the usual 20-30HP against these heavily armoured foes, he will do 200-250HP. Invaluable once every second battle has some dragons or octopuses. I think you'll get the Class Mark later anyway but, either way, you'll need to put in the time to level it up. The other cool thing about Ravness and Jenounes is they have quite a lot of battle dialog with the other Galvastanians through the rest of the chapter.One weird thing that happened in Ch 4 is that Denam defeated a character in Ch 3 and they retreated. Their Warren Report entry reflects this. However Denam meets their associates in Ch 4 and they say that the character is dead and Denam is responsible. Seems like a bug that I might need to research later.Mr GT ChrisPosted: July 14, 2019 1:56 PMPermalinkTake my yen!Osaka, JapanLastSurprise wrote:Ugh.

It's worth keeping Paralytic Wave on those giant octopuses, they cause all kinds of trouble if given the chance. Also, letting your archers get enough TP to cast Dead Weight is probably the most effective way of doing large amounts of damage to monsters at this point in the game.SundownPosted: July 14, 2019 7:57 PMPermalinkMoon to goDallas, TXMr GT Chris wrote:One problem I have, with the way that class leveling works, I feel uncomfortable taking more than one of any class into a battle because I feel like I'm leaving xp on the table and I want to have as many viable classes as possible.

The game seems like it encourages you to stick with your classes, since getting new ones caught up takes forever. The end of Ch.3 tossed a couple of new classes at me and I would be interested in using some of those characters, but since they started at level 3 and my team is 17-18, I had to think hard about if I wanted to grind a bunch to get them caught up (I didn't). It seems to make changing the composition of a team easy (if I want a second knight or third archer its easy to get them caught up to speed), but anything entirely new is a hassle. So far it really hasn't been that hard to deal with, since the beginner classes are capable enough.I don't know if this is one of those games where there is a postgame where you have to grind a lot to complete, so the regular game is made accessible enough for anyone who wants to do that, and the people who want to grind forever don't have to worry about those new class limitations.Switch: 2784-7157-5113DSGamerPosted: July 14, 2019 8:02 PMPermalinkThumbs Up ... ishAmericaAt the risk of getting aspects of this game confused with Knight of Lodis, can’t you autobattle? I feel like when I wanted to try new classes and get them up to speed I’d play practice battles where I would put the lower classes against the higher classes and just grind them.Switch - SW-4008-5437-6025HardekPosted: July 14, 2019 9:24 PMPermalinkOffice LinebackerCanada, West CoastMr GT Chris wrote:I just read up on the PS1 version.https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards...PSP, hands down.This isn't a mere 'port' of the original game, they've completely reworked the mechanics (mostly for the better) and added vast amounts of additional side-content.
