We've got the stats to help you choose where to work.Credit: Monkey Business Images right – ShutterstockThere are plenty of ways to make money as a student, but there's no substitute for a good old-fashioned part-time job. In fact, our most recent Student Money Survey revealed that 74% of you depend on one to fund your everyday living costs.Aside from the fact that employment is usually a more steady source of income than most of our easy ways to earn some cash, adding some experience to your CV will help you to stand out in a crowded and competitive job market.But what are the best paying part-time jobs for students? Well to answer that very question, CV-Library analysed listings for part-time jobs across the UK to find the highest mean salaries – and here's what they found...The work may not be quite as reliable as some of the jobs on this list, but becoming a pet sitter could make you some serious cash.10 high paying part-time jobsThese are highest-paying part-time jobs for students in the UK:Teaching AssistantCredit: Paramount PicturesAverage hourly pay: £8.00Keen to get into teaching once you leave university? Well, why wait until then? By working as a Teaching Assistant, you can get your foot in the door and gain some valuable experience in the process.Clearly, you won't be able to commit to a full-time position, but there are plenty of part-time opportunities out there where you'll only need to work a few days each week.Then, when it comes to applying to a teaching role or PGCE course after university, you'll have work experience to prove your passion and aptitude for the job.Call Centre AgentAverage hourly pay: £8.15Nobody loves phoning up a call centre, but if you've got the gift of the gab and a love of people, you could make the experience a whole lot more enjoyable as a Call Centre Agent. And, aren't you lucky, it's one of the best-paid part-time jobs for students going.Bear in mind that shift patterns do vary in these kinds of roles – one week you might be asked to work every day, and the next just one or two. But, this could be an ideal situation as flexible work patterns will allow you to balance your work and studies, plus everything in between.And did we mention that some companies offer additional bonuses if you do particularly well at bringing customers in?!Customer Service AdvisorAverage hourly pay: £8.34Ah, customer service. The traditional home of students seeking to add to their Maintenance Loans. And, at well over £8 an hour, you can see why it's so popular!Your hours will vary depending on the type of role you end up in, and you could be offering support over the phone, via email or even in person. But whatever medium you're working with, you'll likely be helping customers with refunds or other queries – so having good people skills is a big help.Warehouse OperativeAverage hourly pay: £8.61Far from being sat behind a desk all day, Warehouse Operatives spend most of their time on their feet, moving across the workplace.This job involves a whole range of responsibilities, but most commonly you'll be picking and packing stock for delivery, keeping track of stock levels and loading goods onto vehicles.We've all experienced the frustration of receiving a delivery, only to find half of the order isn't there – so, unsurprisingly, being thorough and having a good eye for detail are high on the list of desirable qualities for Warehouse Operatives.LabourerAverage hourly pay: £9.00The term 'Labourer' covers various sectors. You could be working in construction, trimming hedges, washing windows... so many things, really!Again, if you're not keen on working in an office and prefer to be on your feet all day, this is a great way of finding work outdoors. And, in case you hadn't worked it out, these jobs involve a lot of manual work, so be prepared to get your hands dirty.Exam InvigilatorAverage hourly pay: £9.36To be an Exam Invigilator requires... well, exams. As such, this position isn't available all year round. But if you can land a position as an exam invigilator during exam season, this is a pretty sweet deal.School exams tend to coincide with university study breaks and your extended summer holiday, so this gig should leave you plenty of time to get your coursework done.You'll be supervising GCSE and A Level exams so your shifts will depend on their schedule, although almost all of them will take place during school hours. Full training is generally provided on-site, not that we imagine it'll be too complicated...Customer Delivery DriverCredit: jax10289 – ShutterstockAverage hourly pay: £9.41From online food orders to Amazon packages, Customer Delivery Drivers are responsible for getting people's shopping to their front door.While grocery shopping needs to be delivered in a special, refrigerated van, plenty of other goods bought online simply need a vehicle of any sort to get them from A to B. With that in mind, some companies will even employ you as a Customer Delivery Driver if you have your own car and you're happy to use it for the job.Care AssistantAverage hourly pay: £9.45There's no getting away from the fact that working in care, including as a Care Assistant, is an incredibly demanding job. You'll need compassion, patience, sensitivity and, above all, a real and genuine desire to help people – otherwise, this isn't the job for you.But if you can tick all of those boxes, this is definitely a role worth considering – especially given that it's one of the most well-paid part-time jobs for students.AdministratorCredit: Kalamurzing - ShutterstockAverage hourly pay: £12.50A role as an Administrator is great for those seeking experience in an office environment.Tasks in admin roles vary, so you could be doing anything from managing diaries, taking phone calls, filing, greeting people or sending emails. You'll also be able to add 'organisation', 'communication' and potentially 'office admin software' to the list of skills on your CV.And there are always loads of different Administrator roles available across different industries, so you'll likely have your pick of the litter.TutorAverage hourly pay: £18.87Way, way out in front as the highest-paying part-time job for students is Tutoring.We have a guide to becoming a Tutor, and the truth of the matter is that you could even charge as much as £40 an hour for your services – way above the mean hourly pay reported by CV-Library, although £18.87 is still a very decent hourly wage.If you have aspirations of becoming a teacher, or if you just want to make a mountain of cash by passing on the knowledge that you already have, you should seriously consider becoming a Tutor.Not convinced? Wait until you read about how you can tutor kids while playing computer games with them...So now you know which industries to look for jobs in, what's stopping you?
