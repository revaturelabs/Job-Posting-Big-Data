How do you deal with it as a freelance writer?Are there websites/software you use to scan your work before publishing/submitting to clients?October 7, 2014 at 4:03 am #14660henryParticipantI publish my own work so I have naver faced this problem.October 7, 2014 at 4:11 am #14663ZaccParticipantThat is good of you @henryOctober 7, 2014 at 7:08 am #14672kendralalaParticipantI also make sure that I make and construct my own to avoid this. But sometimes, because of being readers, we unconsciously write something written by someone we have read before‚Ä¶October 7, 2014 at 7:10 am #14673kendralalaParticipantI also have known a plagiarism checker. I tried it checking my original work but I ended up 75% original only. I was wondering how could it happened when everything came actually from my mind..I tried it many times with another works but had the same result. maybe that checker wasn‚Äôt reliable, i may sayApril 27, 2016 at 8:35 pm #86092Kyla Matton OsborneParticipant@kendralala Computerized plagiarism checkers will flag all kinds of weird things. If you used a common phrase like ‚Äúof the‚Äù too many times in a single document, that will be counted as not original.If you writing on a technical topic such as quantum computing (something I wrote about in a post on Canada‚Äôs new Prime Minister) you might have to use very specific phrases, or even specific combinations of phrases, that the plagiarism checker will see as being ‚Äúcopied.‚ÄùIn most cases, as long as there is no more than 15-25% similar/matching content, your work would be considered original. So if you got a score of 75% original, that‚Äôs right on target.October 7, 2014 at 7:21 am #14675ZaccParticipant@kendralala I think most of the work that you find not original yet it is your own is due to the common sentences. There are also common expressions which are used by most writers. That though should make your work to be around 90% originalSeptember 13, 2015 at 12:02 am #30844Kyla Matton OsborneParticipantSome sites where I submit work do scan before publication, but otherwise I really don‚Äôt use a plagiarism checker. I know my content is original, and I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve found a really useful free plagiarism checker.That being said, when I‚Äôm moderating content or just reading other writers‚Äô posts, plagiarism is pretty obvious. Google is actually a fantastic resource for tracking it down and proving it.September 18, 2015 at 1:52 pm #32422Karen FaingesParticipantI agree Kyla, Google is great for checking work. I use it with student papers all the time. Just copy in the first couple of paragraphs and up she comes. It‚Äôs sad how often it works üôÅAuthorPostsViewing 7 reply threadsYou must be logged in to reply to this topic.Log InUsername:Password:Keep me signed inLog InRewardsEarn RewardsRedeem PointsShopping CartOrder StatusCommunityRecent ActivitySite MembersSite DirectorySocial GroupsDiscussion ForumOpportunitiesBusiness OpportunitiesMember NetworkLead ListLanding PagesAutoresponder SettingsHelpFAQ PageGetting StartedSitewide SearchSupport ForumContact UsCopyright ¬© 2021 BlogJobUser Groups@Not recently active"
