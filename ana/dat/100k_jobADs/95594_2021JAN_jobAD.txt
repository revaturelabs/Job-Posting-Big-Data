"Finding God in Career Drift, Job Hopping, and Passion Scrambling – Proverbs 31 WomanSkip to contentProverbs 31 WomanPrimary MenuSubscribeTravel InsposDevotionalsContactSearchSearch for:Spiritual Growth & CareerFinding God in Career Drift, Job Hopping, and Passion Scrambling“No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love Him.” – 1 Corinthians 2:9Since 2009 at age 25, I’ve been praying to God to use me as His instrument of love. I don’t exactly know how or to what extent, but in my heart I always believe that God created me for a purpose and that there is more beyond fulfilling my dreams.For a couple of years, I’ve been contemplating on the essence and meaning of my life. I thought it’s simply about achieving my dreams and living life to the fullest by doing good deeds and an end goal of going to heaven. It sounded easy until series of challenges started unfolding in my life. Until my principles on faith, work, relationships and aspirations were tested during its course.After graduating with recognition in College, my jobs started to define my identity. I got so focused in becoming excellent in what I do. Doors opened to better opportunities, bigger positions and higher pay as well. And the more money I was getting, the more I was getting myself stuck in the rat race. I thought I’ve got nothing to lose with more knowledge, and that it would prepare me for the worst that could happen.Ever considered a virtual career? This might be for you!

If I don’t get what I desire, I just check the horoscope to get a glimpse of what to expect within the year.Just like Eve allowing her desire for wisdom fall into the serpent’s bait (Genesis 3:1-6), I took the power of the future into my own hands.Materialism ate me alive, thinking that real security comes from financial stability, believing that I have the power to create it.As human beings, we never get satisfied. We always want more apart from what we have. At work, our measure of success are bigger pay and higher position. And character, respect and integrity are most often overlooked and disregarded.Have you ever taken a time to reflect if you’re working to live, or you’re actually living to work?Have you ever prioritized work over God and over family? I am guilty of both, and my favorite excuse was that I had no choice because I was building my career. The truth is I had a choice, but I made myself a victim of the situation because I was fixing and resolving the problems with my own strength. My limited capacity to do things couldn’t solve problems that were getting out of my control. I only got myself to a pit of stress and frustration. And even if I try to be that responsible leader who takes accountability in all things, I failed in all other aspects. And it crushed my heart to bits because I made reputation my everything.In life, we go through a roller coaster of emotions, and many times I cannot help but wonder why God allows us to go through difficulties, pain and suffering if He is truly a loving God. Does He listen to our prayers when we fall hard on our knees feeling lost in our lives not knowing how to move forward?But you know, this was the Lord’s answer to me:“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be open to you.” – Matthew 7:7Before, I only seek God when I needed something, and I get frustrated when He’s nowhere. I taunt His character even to the point of asking, ‘Are you even listening to my silent prayers, Lord?’ or ‘Have You turned your back on me?’. Yes I was selfish. I was deluding myself into thinking prayer is one-way and I was treating God as a genie, who could grant me unlimited wishes. Whenever I encountered life challenges and felt like the whole world shatters in front of me, I ask God ‘Why do you let me go through this?’.And then one day, our God, our ever-faithful and loving God, revealed to me that He was shaking me to soften my obstinate heart and get rid of all the specks in my eyes that turned me blind.God enabled me to see myself. As flawed as ever. And that I am nothing without Him.That I am lost without my shepherd.God appoints us with earth angels whom He chooses to lead us back to Him, and I’m grateful to such friend who introduced me to Victory, Fort. It was in July 2015 when I renewed my faith and started a spiritual journey to a more intimate relationship with God, and another friend, Riva Gazveltan, helped me understand God’s truth, sovereignty and faithfulness. I began to appreciate how God loves us as His own children that even if the original sin meant death and total separation from Him, His unconditional love prevailed. He sacrificed His only Son to die on the cross to redeem us from sin.Express and Destress with the Scribble and Coloring Pad! Available HERE.God has changed my heart to be more grateful. Now, when I encounter challenges, I don’t doubt God’s faithfulness any longer. Instead, I bow down my head in prayer to thank Him for the strength He has given me and for the wisdom to discern His desire for me.I started to crave for God’s word, which has empowered me to overcome the worldly truth I shamelessly believed in. Today, when I pray, I surrender to God’s sovereignty, and it humbles me to acknowledge to our Creator that I can’t do anything without Him. Whenever I seek Him, my half empty cup is filled up. And despite my imperfect situations, I find myself complete and whole with His grace. Grace is God’s favor to each and every one of us. Pastor Joey Bonifacio beautifully stated in his book, The Promise No One Wants, that ‘grace has the power to take us where we are unable to go’.God’s Word is a lamp to guide my feet and a light for my path. – Psalm 119:105When I surrendered my life to God, not only was my heart changed, even my motivations were. It is no longer about the worldly and materialistic desire I want to achieve for myself, but the character of faithfulness, obedience and complete trust that God desires for me so He can use me to fulfill my purpose.You might be asking, ‘How do I know what is God’s desire for me?’Let me share with you 3 Principles I learned the hard way in my journey of seeking His will, which I hope can help you in your life and career discernment.SINGLE PAGE 1 | 2 | 3 NEXT →SIGN UP TO RECEIVE INSPIRATION IN YOUR INBOX!Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...Tracy Aquino May 13, 2016 September 22, 2016 career, finding your passion, job hunting	29 thoughts on “Finding God in Career Drift, Job Hopping, and Passion Scrambling”	Meikah Ybañez-Delid (@Meikah) says:	May 13, 2016 at 11:57 AMVery inspiring!

I never applied for it in the past because of fear and insecurity. When I finally found the courage, I prayed for it and thankfully got the job. I know that it was through his guidance that I’m here. 🙂LikeLiked by 1 personReplyTracy Aquino says:	May 16, 2016 at 7:54 AMPraise God for He answered your prayer Jhanis! Sometimes we pray for something and it doesn’t happen because not everything we want for ourselves is God’s desire for us, but when we surrender to Him, He plants the desires in our heart 🙂LikeLikeReplymomi berlin says:	May 16, 2016 at 2:52 AMMy relationship with the Lord isnt that grand and ideal. I would fail him anf myself a lot of times and i could feel his forgiveness in those times. How i wish i could demonstrate and speak of the same faith as you have. Im working in it though.LikeLiked by 1 personReplyTracy Aquino says:	May 16, 2016 at 7:59 AMI appreciate your openness about the status of your faith. A year ago I wasn’t really reading the Bible and my faith was more of head knowledge. It helped me in my spiritual journey to be part of a small group and be guided by a spiritual leader. I’d like to pray for you. Please send me your prayer requests at info@sparksandsunshine.com. 🙂LikeLikeReplymomi berlin says:	May 16, 2016 at 3:46 PMThank you for this.

It spoke volumes to me. Thank you for sharing. I’m reminded once again that God is not yet finished with me. There are times when I feel like I missed out on something or an opportunity and the dreams that He has placed in my heart are just “dreams” and will no longer come to pass. Thank you for this. Very timely. Blessings on you! 🙂LikeLiked by 1 personReplyTracy Aquino says:	May 16, 2016 at 8:11 AMThe article I wrote was an overflow of God’s wisdom, and the messages that struck your heart were His answer to your prayers Joy. 🙂 God loves you more than you know. It takes wisdom to discern between our own desires and God’s will for us.

God bless you! 🙂LikeLiked by 1 personNilyn EC Matugas says:	May 16, 2016 at 7:54 AMThanks for the wonderful reminder! I should not be prioritizing my work over my family and my God. I agree that like most people, I don’t get contented. I’m praying that I will find peace knowing that godliness with contentment is the greatest gain.LikeLiked by 1 personReplyTracy Aquino says:	May 16, 2016 at 8:43 AMI appreciate your kinds words Nilyn! I believe God’s calling is different for everyone. Some women are called to be leaders of companies, and they are doing well in taking care of their family and in managing the business. What’s important is to put God first, and everything else will follow. When things get out of control, seeking God’s counsel is the best to give us peace. 🙂 God bless you!LikeLikeReplyNeri Ann says:	May 16, 2016 at 10:20 AMShoot to the heart! I never really liked my first job before but it actually gave us the bread and butter. I was also able to help my mom with some of our finances. But fast forward to now, I prayed for a job that I will love and I think I have it now and I can also pursue some things that I love, like blogging. I don’t have a high salary, it’s just enough after the next payday comes, but I never really felt contentment and happiness like I feel right now.LikeLiked by 1 personReplyTracy Aquino says:	May 17, 2016 at 5:08 AMPraise God that the article was able to communicate God’s message for you Neri! 🙂 It’s great nowadays that there’s are a lot of job opportunities outside a corporate job. I can relate with your sentiment on fulfilment and contentment doing what you love. I am an aspiring blogger, and hope to get things going like you.LikeLikeReplyMommy Pehpot says:	May 16, 2016 at 12:34 PMI admire your relationship with God.

There are many online resources that can help you in your daily reflections. I listen to the Victory Fort Podcast among others, and go through the Sunday service preachings I missed out on.LikeLikeReplyMitchikels of Nostalgic Momma says:	May 16, 2016 at 3:07 PMThemis article is so timely. I am having struggles right now with my chosen career path and upon reading this, I am so moved by this. I love how God talks to me through other people’s experiences. Thanks a lot for this, Tracy!LikeLiked by 1 personReplyTracy Aquino says:	May 17, 2016 at 6:23 AMGod moves us in amazing ways when we surrender to Him. I am also awe-inspired with the wisdom and overflowing love that embrace me during points of uncertainty, affirming God’s promise of providence when we seek Him. Sharing this verse from you, “Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you.” (Proverbs 2:11). God bless you Michelle! 🙂LikeLikeReplyClarinda Santiago says:	May 17, 2016 at 1:38 AMSo full of inspiration, with a lot of thoughts running on my mind on how to survive today’s uncertainties, I just realized I should surrender everything to God…LikeLiked by 1 personReplyTracy Aquino says:	May 17, 2016 at 6:27 AMAmen!
