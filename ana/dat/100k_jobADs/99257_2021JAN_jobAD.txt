Holds 9th Annual Metro NY Charter School Career FairDate: Saturday, March 5, 2011New York, NY - CharterSchoolJobs.com (a division of K12connect, Inc.) held the Metro NY Charter School Career Fair at Teachers College, Columbia University in New York City on Saturday March 5, 2011. The event brought together over 500 pre-screened candidates looking for instructional and pupil services positions at charter schools in the New York area. Employer tables were completely sold out for 5th year in a row.Despite a very weak job market for professional educators, charter schools across the country are expanding and hiring for a wide range of instructional and non-instructional positions. The explosive growth and increased media coverage of the charter market, coupled with budget cuts and hiring freezes at many traditional public school systems, meant candidate demand for admission to the career fair was extremely high.According to K12connect CEO and founder Kent Strong, based on the very high turnout for last year’s event, the decision was made to require candidates to apply for admission and go through a screening process. Mr. Strong said that for the first time “We declined to admit over 300 candidates this year, because demand was so high.” Many employer representatives were pleased with the reduced number of candidates, because it made the event more manageable and productive.The Platinum Employer Sponsor of the 9th Annual Metro NY Charter School Career Fair wasSuccess Charter Network , one of the top-performing charter school management organizations in United States. “We are honored and humbled that such a highly acclaimed and successful charter management organization chose to be our lead sponsor this year.” He added, “Success Charter Network’s schools are at the very top of the list in terms of academic performance, not just in New York City, but across the entire state of New York.\"About CharterSchoolJobs.comCharterSchoolJobs.com is a service of K12connect, Inc.
