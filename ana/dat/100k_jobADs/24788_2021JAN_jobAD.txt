In life or at work, nobody is immune to failure. But let’s be honest, any workplace bears a very high probability of occupational mishaps, no matter what kind of job it may be. In a sense, it’s part of the definition of ‘being on duty.’So this time, we’re looking at some of the funniest cases that illustrate how failing to perform one’s duties right actually looks in pictures. And thanks to the subreddit You Had One Job, we’ve got a seemingly endless fountain of occupation-related hilarity. Created 8 years ago, the subreddit is 421k-strong in members and aims at capturing posts that show what it means to hear “You Had One Job!” from your coworker, client, or boss.Listen beautiful relax classics on our Youtube channel.Colleagues and customers unite, because this time, no one who failed at bringing the bare minimum to their single job is getting away without being busted. Psst! More funny ‘one job’ posts, aka you wish you’d done it properly but it’s too late now, are waiting in our previous posts here, here, and here.#1 No Wonder I Was Struggling…Image credits: ItsyBitsyStumblebum#2 Figured Out The Clan’s Age Boss!Image credits: OkPreference6#3 Apparently, Mermaids Have ButtsImage credits: reddit.comFailing at whatever it is you’re doing is nerve-wracking. At that point, you may think you are the one making all the mistakes every time, and perfectionists are the ones who suffer the most because of it.Failing poses a threat to our power and confidence, and this, in turn, creates just more stress. Add hectic schedules and never-ending commitments, and you get a toxic brew of low self-esteem. But what if we learn to deal with breakdowns and failures?Dede Henley, an author and leadership strategist, suggests applying productive reasoning when it comes to occupational and professional failures. The first step is to self-reflect about “what you are holding as the ‘truth,’ what you don’t know enough about, and what your part in the breakdown may be,” she explained in an opinion piece for Forbes.Sharing it with your team workers in a way that means you take accountability for your actions is a productive way to go about it.#4 Literally Your Last JobImage credits: SpenceBro#5 It Was Almost FineImage credits: ShrektheGodabove#6 Visible ConfusionImage credits: SmugHatKid12Secondly, Dede suggests allowing your team to “reflect on what they’re holding as the truth that you collectively don’t know about.” In this way, the “collective group can engage in double-loop learning,” which is likely to bring fruitful results and valuable lessons out of the failures.Listen beautiful relax classics on our Youtube channel.And third, don’t forget to apply the newly learned knowledge. This, of course, doesn’t mean that your part of the job is over. On the contrary, the critical part in solving the work failure is owning your part in what happened and “reflecting critically on your performance.” “A big part of handling a failure better is not blaming others for it,” Dede concluded.#7 Got The Christmas Lights Up.
