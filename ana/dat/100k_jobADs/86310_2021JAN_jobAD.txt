This developer conference I would like you to unveil, with a flourish, if you please…Some really galactic improvements to iChat. I'm sick and tired of running Skype and Adium (connected to MSN and AOL/ICQ/.Mac). Give me some cross-network compatibility and some good 'ol calling facilities so I can dial people's real phone numbers. Then I can chuck Skype with its kludgy heavy interface, 1980s style walled garden and closed interface.A nice little refresh of the MacBook Pro – nothing huge, just some additional processor oomph and fixes for those Rev A niggles. Then I'll bite.Thank you.PS. I know lots of people are whining about iPod updates, but I'm real happy with my old one. You know until we can actually download TV shows from the UK iTunes store you're not going to sell me a video iPod.Related← OpenDNS – case study in goodness → Not a good time to buy home entertainment kitaccountability booklog books brighton buses business canada central services crunch cycling deficit devolution diebold digital e-counting e-voting education elections energy estonia eu finance foi french goldsmid gpconf gpex09 green health hove india italian labour library licensing links localgov london music old royal alex opendata ORG organic parliament peace planning podcasts police politics preston-street primark privatisation recipe salad seafront social_care thinking tory transformation transport trust twitter usa video waste webcasting welfare youtube caseUnless where otherwise stated, this site is Creative Commons licensed Attribution-ShareAlikeThe views I express on this site are not necessarily a reflection of the views or policies of organisations I work for or am a member of.
