These employment opportunities include the Garden Café, Dao Diamond Hotel and Restaurant, IDEA Café and Pension House, Fly Tying Industry, and Hammer and Nails Livelihood Center, Inc.These facilities not only provide employment for the deaf but they also help sustain deaf educational programs. They provide monthly contributions to support education as well as provide on-the-job training to students, new graduates, and out-of-school deaf.Presently, these special deaf employment organizations support 145 deaf employees and more will be employed to support new construction projects. These former deaf students now have the opportunity to reach their full potential, are able to support their families, and even provide for the education of their siblings. This growing employment number is a good indicator that IDEA is living up to its mission and vision.Watch this video of our Deaf in their respective jobs.BoholBohol Deafdeafdeaf childrendeaf employmentDeaf PhilippinesDennis DrakeemploymentHelping The DeafIDEAIDEA PhilippinesInternational Deaf Education AssociationPhilippinestagbilaranCategoriesCategories Select Category Bohol Deaf Academy Community Development Current News Education Employment Garden Cafe IDEA DEAF Philippines Latest Idea Deaf News November 2010 updates Photos What happened in 2009 what happened in 2010 what happened in 2011 what happened in 2012 what happened in 2013 what happened in 2014 what happened in 2015 what happened in 2016 What happened in 2017 What Happened in 2018 What Happened in 2019 What’s Happening in 2020 What’s Happening Now Whats Happening Archive OldRecent PostsSummer 2020 NewsletterDonate Your Old Tablets to IDEAChristmas 2019 NewsletterBuwan ng Wika Commemoration at Bohol Deaf AcademySummer 2019 NewsletterWinter 2019 NewsletterSpring 2019 Fundraiser with Mandy HarveyFall 2018 NewsletterIDEA-DEPED ForumSummer 2018 NewsletterInternational Deaf Education AssociationHelp Us Buy A New BusSpring 2018 NewsletterBDA Graduates 2018: Ready to Take on the WorldNew Jagna Dormitory for the DeafArchivesJune 2020February 2020November 2019September 2019August 2019February 2019November 2018September 2018August 2018July 2018May 2018April 2018March 2018January 2018November 2017October 2017September 2017July 2017April 2017March 2017January 2017December 2016November 2016October 2016April 2016August 2015June 2015March 2015January 2015October 2014August 2014July 2014June 2014May 2014April 2014March 2014January 2014December 2013November 2013October 2013August 2013July 2013March 2013February 2013January 2013December 2012August 2012July 2012March 2012February 2012December 2011November 2011August 2011July 2011June 2011April 2011March 2011February 2011December 2010November 2010September 2010August 2010April 2009Contact UsDonate NowPOWERED BY PRO×Home← BackAbout IDEAWhy IDEAHow IDEA is FundedWhere IDEA is ServingThe Founder and the HistoryIDEA – Philippines StaffIDEA – US StaffSupport Us← BackSponsor A Child← BackAbout Child SponsorshipChild Safeguarding PolicySupport A TeacherDonate NowFollow Us← BackWhat’s Happening in 2020What Happened in 2019What Happened in 2018What Happened in 2017Archives← BackWhat happened in 2016What happened in 2015What happened in 2014What happened in 2013Watch Us← BackDeaf Education← BackBohol Deaf AcademyVocationalDeaf Employment← BackDao Diamond Hotel and RestaurantGarden Cafe TagbilaranDine & SignBohol Hearing ClinicHammer and Nails Livelihood CenterFly TyingCommunity DevelopmentSharing Jesus← BackTiptip Deaf ChurchIDEA Philippines Spiritual PolicyDocumentary and Other IDEA Related Videos← BackSign Language TutorialPhoto GalleryContact UsLOGIN"
