Temping can be a great way to build a career path while keeping skills fresh in a regular assignment. Yet, as the weeks go on and the temp contract comes to an end, there are some steps you can take to secure permanent employment at the company if you choose. Use these 3 ways to successfully turn your temp position into a permanent job.Indicate as soon as possible your interest in permanent employment.When you accept a temporary assignment, it’s assumed that you are happy to work for the length of time that the contract indicates. However, many temps automatically think that the temp job will turn into a perm one, which is not the case. If you are genuinely interested in becoming a permanent employee with the company you are assigned to, then you must speak up. Let the recruiter and the on-site HR manager know you would like to be considered for perm placement in your present assignment or in another related employment opportunity there.Be punctual, professional, and productive on the temp assignment.As a temp, you have to work twice as hard to impress the management team at your assignment. Therefore, you will want to be sure to arrive to work early or on time every day. Dress very smartly and conduct yourself in a highly professional manner at all times to stand out from other temps. Complete all assigned tasks, provide quality work, and ask for projects when you have time to spare. Demonstrate your worth to the employer to be thought of as someone that has potential. The harder you work, the more likely you are to be recommended for a permanent job when one comes along.Find ways to blend in with the team and the corporate culture.Temps often feel left out or ostracized in some ways by permanent employees while on assignment. Don’t fall into this way of thinking. Instead, look for every opportunity to blend in with the rest of the team by being a participant and getting along with others. Respect perm employees and they will return the favor. Learn what the corporate culture is all about and do your best to become part of it. Dress and act the part at all times. Be someone that others can rely on to get the job done well. Claim the job you want by understanding how your role as a temp contributes to the success of the company.While these are just a handful of ways you can support your goal of becoming a permanent member of the team, your focus should always be on providing superior results and a good attitude about your work as a temp.If you are looking for temporary jobs in Westchester NY, contact Concorde Personnel today.Tags: temp jobs in westchester, temp jobs in westchester ny, temporary jobs in westchester, temporary jobs in westchester ny, temporary jobs westchester, temporary jobs westchester nyPosted in Career Growth, Job Searching	| No Comments »	4 West Red Oak Lane, 3rd Floor | White Plains, NY 10604 | P: 914-428-0700 | Site MapThe Concorde Group is a full service employment agency in White Plains, NY providing temporary staffing services, executive recruitment, temp-to-hire and permanent job placements.
