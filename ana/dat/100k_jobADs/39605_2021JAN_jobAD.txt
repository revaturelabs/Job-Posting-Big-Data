but men still pocket a \"blokes' bonus'' in terms of pay.New data from the federal government's Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) reveals that 75.9 per cent of companies had a flexible working policy before the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March - up from just 60 per cent five years ago.WGEA director Libby Lyons yesterday called on bosses to make flexible work mainstream and permanent.\"The COVID-19 crisis has proved to Australian employers that they can trust their employees to work flexibly and still be productive,'' Ms Lyons said.\"You don't have to sit in an office to … do your job - you can do it remotely or in hours that suit the responsibilities you have outside work.''The WGEA data, based on reports from nearly 5000 companies with 4 million staff representing 40 per cent of Australia's workforce, reveals two-thirds of men work full-time, compared to just 41 per cent of women.Men earn 20 per cent more than women, on average, for full-time work, taking home an average of $25,543 extra each year.Women make up 40 per cent of managers, although just 18 per cent are in charge of companies and one-third are senior executives.In top management roles, men earn 23.4 per cent than women doing comparable full-time jobs - pocketing $89,141 more than men.The fresh data confirms News Corp Australia's revelation this month of a \"blokes' bonus'', with female university graduates paid less than men in their first job in the same field.Women working in the professions, such as law or accountancy, take home nearly $25,000 less than their male colleagues.Clerical and office staff earn nearly 8 per cent more - or $6327 - if they are male.In community and personal services, women earn nearly 10 per cent or $7467 less than men.Tradies earn 25 per cent more if they are male - bringing home $28,363 more than women - as male-dominated trades such as plumbing and electrics pay more than female-focused trades like hairdressing.The worst profession for women's pay is the financial and insurance industry, where men pocket $45,497 or 27.5 per cent more in average total earnings including overtime, commissions, penalty rates and bonuses.Even the base salary for women is $26,451 or 21 per cent lower than for men.Public servants have the fairest pay, although men still earn $7223 more than women, on average - a 7.7 per cent gender pay gap.In retail, women earn $12,313 or 13.8 per cent less than men when commissions and overtime are counted.The base salary is $6449 or 9 per cent lower for women in retail.In real estate, where many backroom staff are women, men earn $36,058 more, reflecting commissions paid to real estate agents and agency owners.The base salary for women is $16,642 - 15.8 per cent lower than men's.In education, where most women are teachers and men earn higher salaries as principals, men earn $11,562 more on average each year, with a 11.5 per cent pay gap for total remuneration.Even in fields dominated by women, such as the COVID-19 crucial areas of health care and social assistance, men are paid $16,700 or 15.7 per cent more than women.And in the media industry, men earn $30,784 or 22 per cent more than women in total remuneration.The gender gap in media came to a flashpoint in 2017 when TV host Lisa Wilkinson jumped ship after discovering the Nine Network had been paying her less than co-host Karl Stefanovic.Originally published as 'Blokes' bonus': The jobs where Aussie men earn moreMore StoriesThe city Aussies are eagerly abandoning1.7m Aussies could be jobless next yearPremium Content Gnarly dude!
