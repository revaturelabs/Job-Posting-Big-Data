It has the vast Queens Park public park, a place of peace for people who gardens, and a place of fun for children as there is so much to explore. Invercargill has plenty of heritage, from its period buildings, to the automotive and motorcycle history at Transport World. If you want to get into the great outdoors, then Oreti Beach is a popular spot, particularly as the sunsets can be stunning. Invercargill is also a place people fly into before getting the ferry from Bluff to Stewart Island. The peaceful, inspiring and stunning Stewart Island has magnificent wildlife, and the chance to be in nature and among the wonderful people of this great island. Invercargill is also a great base for exploring Southland, one of the world’s most beautiful places and also home to the famous Bluff Oyster Festival.View house sits in InvercargillUnfortunately, there are no house sits in this location right now.However, please do check out other house sits in Southland.Get a FREE Quote and list your house in InvercargillBECOME A HOUSE SITTER IN InvercargillWhere to from here?Take a few minutes now to get a quote and list your house sit.Get a Quoteor call us on0800 748 837For homeownersFind a sitterWhat makes us uniqueHow it worksVideo testimonialsSign inFor house sittersBecome a sitterWhat's in it for youHow it worksSitter testimonialsSign inAboutOur storyOur teamDetailsFAQsPricingTestimonialsT&CsPrivacy PolicyUseful informationThe Boxes to Tick when Searching...House Sitting in NZ Could Leave...Forget Dog Kennels – You Need a...Need a House Sitter?
