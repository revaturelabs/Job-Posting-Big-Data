Yet any of us could be unexpectedly asked to 'say a few words'. So if you don't have any time to prepare, how can you 'be prepared'?The key to making a good impromptu speechThe key to giving unprepared talks isn't having any number of topics 'stored up' in your head ready to be rolled out when the occasion demands. The key is getting very familiar with, and really comfortable with, the essential structure of a good short talk, and then practicing threading any topic that you might briefly speak about into that structure.In a nutshell, the essential talk or presentation consists of:the introduction - you tell them what you're going to tell themthe talk - you tell themthe recap - you tell them what you've told themThis structure is extremely flexible and allows you to concentrate on the bit in the middle that really matters - the talk - and create it out of only three or four 'main points'. 'Making three points' is a far less scary proposition than 'giving an unrehearsed speech'.But it can still feel pretty scary if you've never done it, so it's good to know that there is a powerful and effective way to start training your mind to 'think on its feet' and be ready to come up with those three points when you need them. And the even better news is that spontaneous speeches created on the spur of the moment are often the most memorable and entertaining.How do you do it?Hypnosis can help make it so easy to give an unprepared talkImpromptu speech is an audio hypnosis session created by psychologists with wide experience in public speaking and in helping people overcome internal blocks and barriers.
