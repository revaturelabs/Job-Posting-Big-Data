"CERN CERN Online Summer Student Programme 2021 (Member and Non-Member States) | SmartRecruitersCERN Online Summer Student Programme 2021 (Member and Non-Member States)Geneva, SwitzerlandEmployees can work remotelyInternCompany DescriptionAt CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, physicists and engineers are probing the fundamental structure of the universe. Using the world's largest and most complex scientific instruments, they study the basic constituents of matter - fundamental particles that are made to collide together at close to the speed of light. The process gives physicists clues about how particles interact, and provides insights into the fundamental laws of nature.

Carrying the project online though was a great experience and I do not feel I lack anything except being at the accelerator itself.”“I would say \"do it\". It's a beautiful experience, even if it's online. You will learn a lot and, at the end of the day, it's really satisfying to see the results.”“An online programme can definitely be an educational and enriching experience.”“There are many advantages to getting such an experience, for one you don't have to deal with visa or transportation, you have a flexible working schedule and you get the chance to talk to and get in contact with CERN's highly experienced engineers and researchers.”“Carrying out the project even online is a great experience that you learn so much from. It is an opportunity to come in contact with leading academics and scientist in such a great place as CERN. At the beginning I was anxious about the project being carried online, but I am very happy with how everything evolved. The project and my supervisor were great.”*****And last but not least, make good use of the ‘Motivation’ section to tell us why you’re a great candidate for CERN!Selection procedureCandidates who meet the eligibility criteria and have completed their application before the deadline will pass to the next stage of the selection process.
