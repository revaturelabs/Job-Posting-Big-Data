Recently we have added another QNAP with SMB Fileshare in another location so we can make backup copies to it. However the uplink is quite slow and particularly the merges are taking forever to complete.Would it be possible to add either a Veeam Backup Gateway or Backup Proxy to the remote site to speed up the merges after the copy job completes? Is there any other advice that could possibly speed up our backup copy job to the remote site without needing to speed up our internet?TopAndreas Neufert	VP, Product ManagementPosts: 4801Liked: 944 timesJoined: May 04, 2011 8:36 amFull Name: Andreas NeufertLocation: GermanyContact:Contact Andreas NeufertSend private message	Website	Twitter	Re: Merging incrementals backup copy jobQuotePost by Andreas Neufert » Jun 02, 2020 6:55 pm this postNo, this is the way to go as the merge transport data otherwise over the WAN 2 times.Potentially you can add the QNAP as a Linux Repository (don´t know if you get root for it). This could help to avoid the additional backup server.Important point as well is to enable write-through support on the SMB share or use it with iSCSI/NFS instead if not available.Topfoggy	Veeam SoftwarePosts: 19761Liked: 1823 timesJoined: Jul 11, 2011 10:22 amFull Name: Alexander FogelsonContact:Contact foggySend private message	Re: Merging incrementals backup copy jobQuotePost by foggy » Jun 02, 2020 7:35 pm this postAlso, consider using WAN acceleration for optimal data transfer over a slow link.TopBen123	LurkerPosts: 2Liked: neverJoined: Jul 26, 2017 8:24 amFull Name: BenContact:Contact Ben123Send private message	Re: Merging incrementals backup copy jobQuotePost by Ben123 » Jun 02, 2020 9:36 pm this postAndreas Neufert wrote: ↑Jun 02, 2020 6:55 pm No, this is the way to go as the merge transport data otherwise over the WAN 2 times.You mean with a gateway server at the remote site is the way to go?TopMildur	Service ProviderPosts: 398Liked: 174 timesJoined: May 13, 2017 4:51 pmFull Name: Fabian KesslerContact:Contact MildurSend private message	Re: Merging incrementals backup copy jobQuotePost by Mildur » Jun 02, 2020 9:50 pm 1 person likes this postYes, benDoing that will reduce needed WAN traffic dramatically. Only changes (vib) will send to the remote site.Without gateway server on remote site, veeam will transfer the „vbk data blocks“ and „vib data blocks“ back to your primary site, synthesize the full, and transfer the new vbk data blocks back to the remote site.With gateway server, only changed data will be transferee to remote site, the gateway server on remote site will read the „vbk data blocks“ and „vib data blocks“ and synthesize the new vbk file.They will no get transferred back to primary site, because you have an veeam gateway server in the remote site which can do all the work.TopAndreas Neufert	VP, Product ManagementPosts: 4801Liked: 944 timesJoined: May 04, 2011 8:36 amFull Name: Andreas NeufertLocation: GermanyContact:Contact Andreas NeufertSend private message	Website	Twitter	Re: Merging incrementals backup copy jobPost by Andreas Neufert » Jun 03, 2020 6:21 am this postGateway Server for SMB/NFS or Windows Repository Server for iSCSI.TopPost ReplyPrint viewDisplay: All posts1 day7 days2 weeks1 month3 months6 months1 year Sort by: AuthorPost timeSubject Direction: AscendingDescending6 posts • Page 1 of 1Return to “VMware vSphere”Who is onlineUsers browsing this forum: No registered users and 15 guestsMain	All times are UTCDelete cookiesMembersThe teamContact usDISCLAIMER: All feature and release plans are subject to change without notice.Powered by phpBB® Forum Software © phpBB LimitedPrivacy | Terms"
