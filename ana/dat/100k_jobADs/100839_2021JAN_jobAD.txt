If you don't have one, our office is available to help you create one. If you do have one, stop-by our office to get it reviewed or submit it electronically. View our services.Practice how you'll introduce yourselfThis is the time to create an elevator pitch. An elevator pitch is a short introduction of yourself that tells the employer who you are, what you're studying, and what opportunities you're looking for. The pitch should be no more than 15-30 seconds long. Here's an example:\"My name is [insert name] and I'm studying [insert major] at IUPUI. I'm looking for opportunities in [area of interest]. I'm here to explore part-time jobs and internships.\"Research participating employersResearching the employers you want to meet can give you some talking points during the fair. Some job fairs have an app you can download before the event with information about the employers. Another benefit of using the app is determining what tables you absoutely want to visit. This might help you estimate how many resumes you need to print.What to wear and bringWhat to wearAt IUPUI's Fall Part-Time Job Fair, you can wear casual clothing. If you are attending a full-time job or internship fair, you should wear business casual or business professional clothing.What to bringYou can bring a portfolio folder that has a writing utensil and pad of paper inside. Be sure to bring copies of your resume as well. If you don't have a portfolio, bring a folder and a notepad to take notes with. Either option will help store business cards if you collect any.How to approach employersGo to an employer you have interest in. If there are others in front of you, wait your turn. Do not interrupt their conversation. (If the employer is busy, this gives you time to mentally practice what you are going to say.)Once the employer is available, give them a firm handshake. Then, introduce yourself by using your elevator pitch. From there, it's all about selling yourself and showing interest in the company. If you did your research, you can use the talking points discussed earlier.The most important tip is to be friendly and courteous. Make sure you show them proper eye contact and body language. Conclude the conversation by asking how you can follow up with them.What NOT to doDon't interrupt those who came to the table before you. Be patient and courteous. Interrupting can make a bad first impression.Don't stop by tables purely for the freebies. Taking some at the end of a conversation is appropriate, but only stopping by for freebies is a display of unprofessional behavior.Don't bring your backpack. You should only bring a folder to store your resumes, business cards, and other pertinent information.Don't pass out your resume without an introduction. Take the time to introduce yourself, learn about the employer and their company, and express your interests.After the fairAfter the fair, follow up by sending a thank you email. Quickly reintroduce who you are and then thank them for their time. If you are sending multiple emails, try to keep them personal. Employers can typically tell if it's a cookie-cutter email.If you have an electronic portfolio like LinkedIn, try searching for them and sending a message this way.TrackingAs you start applying for jobs, it’s important to track where you’ve applied. We recommend keeping a record of when you submitted your application and the corresponding submission deadline. This will be useful if you are applying to multiple jobs. It can be difficult to follow up with hiring managers if you aren’t sure when you applied.Follow-up tipsAfter you’ve submitted your application, we recommend waiting 2-5 days before following up about your application. \"Following up\" means contacting the hiring manager to see if they are considering you for an interview. There are three ways you can do this:EmailSend a professional email detailing when you submitted your application and your interest in scheduling an interview. This guide walks you through how to format a follow-up email and what you need to include.CallCall the place of employment and inquire about when you’ll hear back about an interview. Be sure to introduce yourself and state why you're calling. Look at the example below to see how you can do this:\"Hello, my name is [insert name]. I submitted an application for the [insert position title]. I was curious about the status of my application.\"In-PersonStop by where you applied and ask to speak to the hiring manager about the status of your application. This is an easy way to get a straight-forward answer about where your application stands.NetworkingDon’t be afraid to utilize your network as you're searching for jobs. It’s okay to approach your professor after class or during their office hours and ask about available positions within the academic department. Your professor might even have openings within their office. This applies to past employers and co-workers too. Reach out to your contacts and see what's out there!Networking Tip SheetCheck out our Networking Tip Sheet hereSearch the Job BoardWhy work?Prepare to SearchBegin your SearchFraudulent JobsInternshipsHire AchieversAdditional links and resourcesStudentsSearch for jobsSchedule an AppointmentJob Search ResourcesChat With UsEmployersOn-CampusOff-CampusCommunity Work-StudyQuick ResourcesWork-Study Authorization FormWork-Study Funds TrackerPayroll SchedulePartner With UsRequest PresentationRefer a StudentContact UsOffice of Student EmploymentUniversity College / Division of Undergraduate Education(317) 274-0857 | future@iupui.eduUniversity Tower, Suite 202 | 911 W North St. | Indianapolis, IN 46202Virtual only: Mon.-Fri. 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.Virtual drop-in hours: Mon.-Wed. from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m.TwitterInstagramAccessibility | Privacy Notice | Copyright © 2021 The Trustees of Indiana University"
