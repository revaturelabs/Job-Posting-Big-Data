But some weeks, one day of celebration is just not enough.Same protein waffle recipe as yesterday. But today topped with Lori’s buckwheat honey marshmallow fluff and almond butter mixed with syrup.So much decadence for 9 in the morning. I almost couldn’t handle it. But then I got a grip on myself and gobbled it all up :)Other wonderful eats from the day included a homemade shrimp burger. I remember seeing shrimp burgers on the menu of a burger place in Calgary. I desperately wanted to try it, but knew that when in Calgary, you eat the beef. Needless to say, the idea of a shrimp patty has been teasing my taste buds ever since.Started with a dozen large raw shrimp (bought frozen then defrosted). Cut up small then mixed in:1 tbsp bread crumbs (I used a smashed up rye cracker)1 tbsp egg whites1 tbsp mayonnaise (Yes a whole tablespoon. Do it.)Pinch dried garlicPinch red pepper flakesPinch black pepperIt’s not a sticky mixture like beef or turkey burgers. Very wet and sloppy because shrimp is so, well, wet. I plopped it on my George Foreman grill, but you could also put it in a frying pan or the oven. Just make sure it’s at a low temp and as time to cook on one side so it doesn’t crumble when you try to flip it over.Makes one large patty. Eaten on an english muffin with spinach, red onion, ketchup and mustard.Ohmy. It was goooood. The mayo in the mix is what really made it tasty. I have a feeling my taste buds will be wanting this more often!On the side I had some of my microwave sweet potato chips. All you do is slice up a sweet tater real thin, spread it out on a plate, season, and nuke for a ludicrous amount of time. For these, I microwaved them for 10 minutes, flipping halfway through. Once cooled, they get crunchy like a chip!While not eating today, I was also exercising. Almost done the first week of my new lifting split and I really like it! My body was completely hammered after a week off exercise. Major DOMS after my first couple days. Even from just doing sprints on the elliptical! Anyways, if you’re curious, here is what my Shoulder/Abs workout looked like today:Warm-up: 5 minutes walking on the treadmill + 1 mile runStraight sets:Arnold press @ 10 lbs x 1515 lbs x 1020 lbs x 510 lbs x 10Alternating sets (x3):Cable lateral raise @ 2.5 lbs x 12Cable horizontal woodchop @ 12.5 lbs x 12Superset (x3):Mountain climber x 60 secPlank ups x 10Superset (x3):Russian twist on bosu 6lbs x 30Plank on bosu x 60 secSuperset (x3):Squat with front raise x 20 (holding swiss ball)Prone jackknife x15Cool-down: 1 mile run + 5 minutes walkingThat opening press set killed my shoulders. It was all downhill from there ;) And in case you can’t tell, I hate doing crunches. Give me a plank any day!Kind of ironic that I just started myself on a weight lifting focused workout routine, as I suspect I may now be doing a lot more running!You see, I got a part-time job! At a running store!!Even though I am a full-time personal trainer, I still don’t work the usual 8 hours a day. My client base is still increasing, but I am finding myself with a lot of down time. Especially on weekends. So I’ll be selling running shoes, clothing, gadgets and apparel to Toronto runners in my spare time. The extra money will be great and I’m really looking forward to meeting some more fitness-minded folk! They also do a run club and running clinics that I’ll probably start participating in as well. I’m pretty stoked about the employee discount. I’m desperate for a new pair of running shoes!I’d just like to say, as for my full-time job of training, I am loving it. I’m to the point now where I’m starting to see results with my clients (one guy has already dropped 8% body fat with me!) and it is so rewarding. Not to mention, I’ve already had a few clients renew training packages with me, so it’s nice to know they like and respect me enough to want to keep working with me!Now I am off to pack! I’m heading to Buffalo, NY for weekend with some friends. A special edition Fitness Friday post will be going up, but it will have to last you until I’m back on Sunday. Have a great weekend everyone! xoShare this:EmailTwitterFacebookRedditLike this:Like Loading...RelatedPosted on September 2, 2010, in Workouts and tagged abs, burger, protein waffles, shoulders, shrimp, waffles, Weight Lifting, work.

Just not commenting because law school just started so I’ve been pressed for time – thank goodness I can access my google reader on my itouch. Second, I need to defriend you on facebook – I find out all the surprise new before the post goes up ;) (just kidding of course! CONGRATS on the new job – I’d like to already put my request in for some tips on buying the correct running shoes. thanks) And third, I’m starring this post for sure because most of the exercises are things I can actually do at home with my free weights. So thanks for that too!Nicole GPS Enjoy Buffalo!ReplyCandice @ ChiaSeedMe | September 3, 2010 at 12:12 amI am so happy for you that training is going so well!! Makes me lean toward getting my certification again. How rewarding that your clients are making progress and coming back!And I am so stoked about your method of cooking sweet potato chips in the microwave. I have never thought of that, but how handy! Will definitely be stealing this idea from you:)Replygreensandjeans | September 3, 2010 at 1:54 amThat’s awesome! The best part of my job now is DEFINITELY the employee discount and the fact that I get to talk about cycling and running all dayReplyJenn | September 3, 2010 at 2:39 amThat waffle looks delicious!!!Congrats on the part time job!

Susan, that is great. I’ve come to find (working two jobs myself) they are more fun when they involve something you like doing. I work part-time as the front desk attendant at my boathouse. So much better than retail!If I could have waffles like yours, every morning would be a waffle morning! I’ve never thought of putting Fluff on a wuffle but I’m going to have to give it a try now :)ReplySusan | September 3, 2010 at 5:28 pmYour “wuffle” typo made me laugh, and now all I can think of is “fluffles” for fluff waffles ;)ReplyAnne @ a daily slice | September 3, 2010 at 5:21 pmThat shrimp pattie looks delightful :) I am super jealous of your new gig–I’m dying to work at Lululemon, but there’s NO way I’d have time!!ReplyRunToTheFinish | September 3, 2010 at 5:32 pmI saw you over on Janetha’s and toally glad I stopped by because the shrimp burger is too cool!

I WANT!Congrats on the running store job!!ReplyMatt Kay | September 7, 2010 at 7:01 pmI like the part where you put the chile flakes in the bowl with the shrimp. :DLooks great. I love fish burgers in general and although I admit I’ve never made shrimp burgers there is no doubt in my mind that this would be right up my alley.ReplyHolly | September 14, 2010 at 12:06 pmcongrats on the job love! but more so, congratulations on that KILLER recipe for making sweet potato chips. those are most definitely in my future :)ReplyLeave a Reply to Angharad Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
