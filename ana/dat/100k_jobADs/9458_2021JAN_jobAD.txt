They are always hiring, cert or not, good guy or bad.. whatever... They are just hiring..It's luck of the draw, no apparent set plan or agendaThe sheep generally do not like the sheepdog. He looks a lot like the wolf. He has fangs and the capacity for violence. The difference, though, is that the sheepdog must not, cannot and will not ever harm the sheep. Any sheepdog who intentionally harms the lowliest little lamb will be punished and removed.I Am the Sheepdog.CommentPostCancelMcPheniusForum MemberJoin Date: Jul 2005Posts: 531ShareTweet#409-09-2005, 11:06 AMI haven't been seeing the BSO hiring posters on the county buses lately, but just earlier today I saw one on a bus for Ft.

Most of the Florida agencies have recognized this over the past few years, that is why the employment section on the application is getting fatter. They shouldn't hold this against you as long as you were a good employee and not terminated or a time abuser. Many B.I's may not like to process someone like you because it is a lot of leg work. The easiest way is to help yourself out. Have all of your documentation in hand, and answer you questionaire honestly and to you ability. If you help them do the leg work, they will look at you more positively, remember, most of the departments down here have a small background investigations department and many of the B.I's have multiple cases to process, not just police, but civilians also. Help yourself by helping them. If they still frown on your excessive job history, then apply to another agency. Here in Florida there are many good agencies to work for that will hire you. You just have to shop around. Also, don't get frustrated, most agencies will work with out of state people during the processing and back ground phases, remember they need people, so sell yourself.CommentPostCanceljeffILRegistered UserJoin Date: Mar 2005Posts: 3249ShareTweet#1009-30-2005, 09:13 PMWent through the BSO hiring process a few months ago.
