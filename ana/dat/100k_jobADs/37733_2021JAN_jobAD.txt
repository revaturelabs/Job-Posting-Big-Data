Countries have been intermittently easing their restrictions when cases have fallen and have had to reinforce them after just a matter of months.On a grand scale, the cases are still on the rise and with the way the spread has reacted to restrictions or the lack thereof, it looks like things won’t really be back to normal until a vaccination comes along.And while there does appear to be some promise in that regard, it doesn’t look like we’ll have a readily available vaccine until next summer at the earliest. And until then, all of the other consequences of lockdown will still be prevalent.Because a lot of companies have had to close their offices for the time being, with some of them, unfortunately, having to shut down permanently, there are many people who are facing unemployment and many who are working from home.Online Jobs are the New NormalRemote jobs and online jobs have become the new normal and if you want to keep generating an income during this whole ordeal, then online jobs are probably where you should be focusing your search.This is quite a new ground for a lot of people. Even though working exclusively online has been a thing that many have been doing for many years now, it’s still quite foreign to a lot of the general public.And what you and many others might very well be dealing with right now, is having recently lost your job and having to go in search of a new remote one, but facing a lot of rejection or just outright having your resume ignored by prospective employers.There are a number of reasons why this could happen, but it could also be the fact that your resume might just be missing certain skills that are of paramount importance for acquiring an online job.Get a FREE RESUME CRITIQUEAnd that’s entirely understandable, if you’ve been primarily working in-person jobs for your whole life, you haven’t had to focus on more remote-specific skills when putting your resume together.But now if you are in need of a new source of income, it’s important that you consider some new skills when writing a resume. Here are 3 really important ones to include:Digital CommunicationWhat are we talking about when we discuss digital communication? It encompasses the things that you would expect from the name such as communication through email and mobile chat, but there are a few other components too.Effective digital communication involves being capable of utilizing the full potential of the internet to convey the message of your service and to keep in touch with as many potential clients and customers as you can.This means also having a certain amount of ability to use social media, blogs, and website building tools such as WordPress. Even if you think that stuff is silly, it’s worth familiarizing yourself with it on some level.The internet is extremely important for marketing right now and the more employees capable of good digital communication a business has the better. So this is a skill you should work on and add to your resume for sure.Time ManagementNot all remote jobs are the same, but one thing that you can expect from an online job is having a certain amount of control over your own schedule. This won’t always be the case of course, but it often is.And it seems like a very desirable aspect of a job. Just being assigned work and tasks and being able to complete them at whatever point in the day you want. It seems pretty freeing and should, in theory, free you from a lot of pressure.But in reality, it can actually have the opposite effect. It allows you the opportunity to procrastinate and to slack off and that can lead to your work overwhelming you. Those who are hiring remote employees are very well aware of this.If you don’t make it clear on your resume that you are capable of managing your own time, getting work done efficiently, and having a real routine even when you’re not actually in an office, people will be wary about hiring you. So be aware of how important this is.Inependent Problem SolverAnother thing about working remotely is that you won’t have anyone else around you who you can ask for help when a problem arises. Of course, fellow employees and superiors can usually be contacted by phone or email, but this can be a slow process.In order to avoid slowing down your progress with whatever tasks you’re doing, it’s better if you can just work through problems by yourself. No employer wants to be constantly bothered with phone calls and messages over things you should be able to fix yourself.On your resume, make it clear that you are capable of taking the initiative so that you can solve issues and not constantly have to be running for help. Give a few examples of past instances where you have done so to drive the point home.Even when we get beyond this virus and things start to regain some semblance of normalcy, remote work might continue to be the status quo. Many companies have probably started to realize all the benefits that come with it.And so, you should think of mastering these skills to the point where they can fit nicely into your resume as a long-term investment in your future.Need more job advice?Join Our DiscussionFor more insights and a community of like-minded professionals join our LinkedIn group Resume Help and Advice for Professionals and ExecutivesCareer Advice, career change, career strategies, job search, job search tips, job search tools, online jobs, Resume Skills, resume writing, Resumes	Recommended PostsMake Your Next Career Count With These ProfessionsTips For Job Hunting with a DisabilityWhy You Should Get Your Resume Updated NowLeave a CommentCancel replyCategoriesCategories Select Category Career Articles & Resources (164) Career Discussions (359) Career Education (156) Cover Letters (14) Fun With a Purpose (66) Interviews (91) Job Benefits (9) job search (387) Job Search Tools (88) LinkedIn (62) Links (5) Links to Related Articles (20) Miscellaneous (135) Networking (171) Recruiters (44) Required Reading (49) Resumes (128) Salary & the Market (15) Uncategorized (577) Work/Life Balance (28)Past PostsPast Posts Select Month January 2021 (1) December 2020 (2) November 2020 (4) October 2020 (3) September 2020 (5) August 2020 (6) July 2020 (8) June 2020 (8) May 2020 (7) April 2020 (7) March 2020 (8) February 2020 (6) January 2020 (5) December 2019 (4) November 2019 (3) October 2019 (4) September 2019 (3) August 2019 (5) July 2019 (5) June 2019 (6) May 2019 (5) April 2019 (3) March 2019 (5) February 2019 (6) January 2019 (7) December 2018 (5) November 2018 (6) October 2018 (6) September 2018 (6) August 2018 (6) July 2018 (7) June 2018 (5) May 2018 (4) April 2018 (6) March 2018 (6) February 2018 (6) January 2018 (8) December 2017 (9) November 2017 (6) October 2017 (8) September 2017 (7) August 2017 (9) July 2017 (6) June 2017 (7) May 2017 (7) April 2017 (5) April 2013 (2) March 2013 (3) February 2013 (8) January 2013 (5) December 2012 (5) November 2012 (9) October 2012 (5) September 2012 (4) August 2012 (9) July 2012 (6) June 2012 (5) May 2012 (3) April 2012 (6) March 2012 (8) February 2012 (10) January 2012 (8) December 2011 (8) November 2011 (10) October 2011 (8) September 2011 (9) August 2011 (10) July 2011 (8) June 2011 (10) May 2011 (8) April 2011 (8) March 2011 (9) February 2011 (8) January 2011 (11) December 2010 (9) November 2010 (10) October 2010 (11) September 2010 (9) August 2010 (10) July 2010 (12) June 2010 (12) May 2010 (7) April 2010 (8) March 2010 (10) February 2010 (7) January 2010 (9) December 2009 (10) November 2009 (7) October 2009 (10) September 2009 (8) August 2009 (9) July 2009 (8) June 2009 (9) May 2009 (6) April 2009 (7) March 2009 (7) February 2009 (6) January 2009 (8) December 2008 (9) November 2008 (8) October 2008 (9) September 2008 (5) November 2006 (3) October 2006 (5) August 2006 (6) July 2006 (3) June 2006 (8) May 2006 (7) April 2006 (5) March 2006 (6) February 2006 (7) January 2006 (6) December 2005 (11) November 2005 (10) October 2005 (11) September 2005 (13) August 2005 (14) July 2005 (13) June 2005 (9)From Our Clients…Greg,First of all thank you very much for job well done.
