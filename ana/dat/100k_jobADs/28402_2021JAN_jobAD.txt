This can be obtained from a variety of institutions, including online schools, community colleges, trade schools, and so on. Students are then usually required to pass an examination for their certification. This education gives CNAs the freedom to work in a variety of different settings like hospitals, nursing homes, and urgent care clinics. CNA’s may also go back to school if they desire to become an LPN or RN.
