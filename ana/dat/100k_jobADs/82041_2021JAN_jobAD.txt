Either way, we have some amazing projects to share with you today.The theme for this month's hop is Fancy Folds.There are literally hundreds of different fancy fold cards and they evolve over time and have a re-birth from time to time too as we forget about them and then suddenly they reappear.This hop was good timing for me as I recently hosted an all day event with fellow demonstrator Laura Mackie with the theme 'Fancy Folds'.Here are a few of the folds that we made on the day.This is called a Dutch Fold.A wiper card, can you see that little birdy popping up!?Mmmm not sure what this one is called but it is a 3d freestanding card which has an easel card built in!Each of the attendees received the beautiful Laser Cut Bird Ballad Cards & Tin (they are gorgeous!)I hope you have enjoyed my projects today and I am now going to pass you on to Laura who I am sure has something beautiful to share with you.Don't forget to leave a comment, we really appreciate your feedback!Happy Stampin'JoxJuly Roll Call ListLaura MackiePia GerhardtSandra RobertsTricia ButtsLinda HandfordShirley MerkerStacey MarshMichelle BryantJaney BackerCindy Mitchell-ClarkAnastasia RadloffMelissa TennisonDeb NaylorJo Blackman - YOU ARE HEREat July 27, 2019Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest11 comments:Cindy Mitchell-Clark 27 July 2019 at 14:52Lots of ideas here - thanks for sharingReplyDeleteRepliesReplyShirley 27 July 2019 at 17:06What a great class!
