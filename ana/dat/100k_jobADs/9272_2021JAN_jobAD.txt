He said the current situation, where businesses are re-opening, but childcare will not be available for some time is \"a perplexing mismatch\".'For working families, childcare is the lifeblood of an inclusive labour market'When Health Minister, Simon Harris, was challenged on this recently he admitted the situation was \"not ideal\", before adding: \"People will be relying on family and friends in the interim to give a ‘dig out’ while we get back to formally opening crèches and childcare facilities. Under Phase 2 more people can come in and out of your home.\"However Cllr McNelis said this has created a situation which endangers workers’ job security and which will impose a strain on working relationships between managers and workers.“For working families, childcare is the lifeblood of an inclusive labour market,\" said Cllr McNelis. \"The importance of childcare cannot be understated for ensuring high levels of maternal labour market participation, it means households can improve their household income by enabling a second earner to go out and work, and for lone parents, it is the passport to ensuring their economic independence.\"View/Hide TagsChild care Labor councillor Social Issues Simon Harris Health Minister Workplace Relations Commission Niall McNelis Cllr McNelis Jade McNelis Musicians SingersMore Stories...Re-opening of Galway for angling 'welcome' says KyneNew pedestrian and cycle measures for LetterfrackThoor Ballylee blooms again to celebrate WB Yeats’s birthday this weekendBook of condolences opened for much loved Chick GillenRutley’s surprise birthday guestOceans of Learning Series showcases and celebrates our seas onlineIreland West Airport supports Ryanair’s call to protect regional connectivityZander’s the new canine face for the Guide DogsAnother gripping finale as season 20 ends on Ros na Rún tonightGalway Hospice launches Virtual GardenCycling, coffee, cakes, chats - what’s not to love?In-person physiotherapy appointments now availableMore like this...Parents must not be made choose between childcare and work, says McNelisMcNelis calls for Ireland to adopt universal public childcare systemCutting Covid-19 payment would be 'penny wise and pound foolish', says McNelisJuly Stimulus 'fails to address the needs of those working in the Arts' says McNelisGovernment must deliver on childcare scheme for 'heroic' healthcare workersGuarantee needed on childcare for essential workers at end of JunePublic meeting on childcare costsMcNelis says new Government programme is just old ideas ‘rebranded and repackaged’McNelis calls for nurses registration fees to be waived for 2021Give healthcare worker a bonus May Day payment as a 'gesture of solidarity'Place your advert nowAdvertisementAdvertisementTweets by galwayadAdvertisementAdvertiser.ie | Contact | Place an Ad | Terms & Conditions | Privacy Policy | © 2021 Advertiser.iePage generated in 0.2978 seconds."
