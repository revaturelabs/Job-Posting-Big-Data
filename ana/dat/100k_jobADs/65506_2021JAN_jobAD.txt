However, that being said, work still provides an important focus and sense of purpose for the vast majority of us. It may not be (nor can it be) a constant party but your job can offer a sense of fulfilment and satisfaction, as well as an environment in which to grow and develop. If you are seriously dreading every Monday morning, and find yourself counting down the hours each day, it may be time to reassess. Not only should you work for your job, but your job should work for you. So here are five signs that it is probably time to move on to greener pastures.1. There’s no room for progressionFeel like you’re treading water? Most of us have a huge desire to learn and grow in our careers. If there’s no room for growth in your current role then you might need to consider moving on before you become bored, frustrated, and feeling unchallenged. A clear trajectory of progression can come in various forms - more responsibility, a higher wage packet, a promotion, flexible working, increased autonomy, management responsibilities. Work out which one means the most for you and pursue it as a form of progression.After two years in your role, look inwards and outwards (at your colleagues) and assess if there is genuinely a space for you at a more senior level, the possibility of expanding your current role, or moving sideways. If not, then it might be time to move on.2. Promises are not deliveredThere’s nothing more soul-destroying that being promised certain things at work and not having them materialise. It can lead to a decrease in motivation and a rise in self-doubt. If what you’re asking for is really important to you and it’s not delivered in a year then it might be time to investigate why. Your career and professional development is important - if the company is stalling your ambitions and stunting your growth, then you might find an alternative organisation is in a better position to help you achieve your goals.3. You don’t want your boss’s jobIt’s hard to stay motivated and stick at a job if you don’t know what you’re aiming for. For many of us, we’re motivated by the desire to be promoted and progress up the line of command. As a result, it’s important to work for someone who inspires you to succeed in to their role, or join them at that level. If you look up and there is no role model present, you might have a tough time convincing yourself that each day is worth your time and effort. To move forward in your career, perhaps consider moving somewhere where you do want your boss’s job.4. You have no autonomyWhen it comes to bosses, there is no one size that fits all; we all have remarkably different needs. That being said, there are certain bosses who opt for a slightly more dictatorial management style. Simply being told what to do in every aspect of a given task will not provide you any room for growth or progress. If your boss is prone to barking orders, leaving no room for you to develop your own ideas and sense of autonomy, it may well be time to reassess your role. Find a job where your manager utilises a consultative and coaching approach to leadership and you’ll find yourself much happier at work.5. You don’t see the value in what you doIf you feel uncomfortable at work, and find your ethics and values are constantly being challenged, it is almost certainly time to question your future. Your moral compass is an integral part of your personality and it should match your current working environment. If you find yourself locked in a constant battle, it can prove to be extremely draining. If you can’t see the value in your work, or the service/product the company provides then it might be time to move on. To come alive at work, what you do needs to reflect who you are and what you stand for, whether that’s how a manager should treat their team members, or how socially responsible a company should be.If you’re experiencing some of these signs, want to change job or career, but don’t know where to start, contact me to set up a free introductory session to discuss how I can help.Posted on: 21 March 2016 | Category: Insights Tips | by: Alice StapletonCareer Coach LondonCareer Coaching LondonCareer AdviceTweetShareRecent Articles:Understanding the Stages of (Career) ChangeCareer-Changer Series: From Infrastructure IT to Founding a StartupWant to Change Career?
