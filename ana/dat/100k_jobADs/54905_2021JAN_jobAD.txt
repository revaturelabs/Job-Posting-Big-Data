I am currently a student at NC State in Jenkins MBA. I have lots of experience with cleaning, organizing, event help, and others.InfoReviews 43CampusesChapel Hill, Raleigh, Virtual, DurhamGroupsI am a member of the American Marketing Association and Finance Club at NC State. I babysit and pet sit occasionally when I am needed.CategoriesCleaning I regularly clean, do dishes, vacuum, do laundry, and dust in my house.Events Since organizing is one of my skills, it plays into planning events. I think that a lot of organization is needed to be able to plan something. I would love to be able to assist others in doing this. I love to be creative and plan parties. I have planned many gatherings for the club that I started in my High School.Yard I take care of the garden in front of my house and rake leaves. I have never mowed grass so my skills are partly limited in this area. However, I am very capable of taking care of a garden.Organizing The OCD in me takes over when it comes to organizing. I would say that I am a very organized person and would absolutely love to help others organize. It is one of the many things I really enjoy doing. Things like filing, stacking, cleaning out/ organizing, are not tedious, but joyous activities to me. As part of my volunteer work for my family company, I organized all of the receipts for over 5 years.Tutoring As a babysitter, I have had to tutor many of the children I take care of. I am a straight A student so I have proficient knowledge and understanding of what it takes to tutor. I am patient and take that time to actually explain the material, if the person is willing to learn of course.Painting I painted my bathroom single-handedly and have taken part in painting most of the rooms in my house and my friends' houses. I have the ability to paint and have a basic understanding of what is needed to do so.Tech I am certified in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. A couple of years ago I spent some time teaching elderly women in my community how to utilize their computers and tablets. I have a basic understanding of computers and I am proficient in Microsoft Access, Publisher, and Excel.Anything As I mentioned I take care of children and animals, so this is something else to add to my experience and skills. If any jobs regarding child or pet care arise I would be more than happy to fill the need.Moving I am great at packing boxes and organizing items for moving.EquipmentCleaning Pack Swiffer, vacuum, all-purpose cleaner, toilet cleaner, Windex, paper towels, Clorox wipes, wood polishLadder Regular sized ladderVerification Info| Anything in Chapel HillLouann D.
