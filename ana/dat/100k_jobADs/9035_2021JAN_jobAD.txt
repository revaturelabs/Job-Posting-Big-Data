Services Needed: Boarding.Doggy Exercise And PlayPart TimeHello, I'm hoping to find someone to help walk/ take my 2 dogs out (Golden Retriever and Husky). My life is kinda busy with a newborn and doing some school classes that unfortunately my poor fur babies haven't been getting much time out that they use to get. I usually took them to Rohr dog park, which is only 10 mins from my home, for about an hour every day to get that energy out and I'm hoping that someone can continue this a few times a week or if they can't take them to the dog park give them a good 45 min- 1 hour walk. I'm on maternity right now so I'm always home but my baby dad will be away for 45 days so I don't have the help I use to have. It's 50 for 3 days a week, so pretty much 16 for an hour. If you're interested just let me know!Cat CarePart TimeCats CareTwo Maltipoo Puppies Need Lunch &PlayPart TimeI have two puppy maltipoos (Gia and Gigi), they are 3 months old.
