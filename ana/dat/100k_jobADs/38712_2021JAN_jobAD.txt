Except for some weird network issues that prevented everyone from being in the same session at the same time. We'll figure it out. Turn it all off and back on again.Same time next week: Monday, 5-8 PST.Using the new squad seems like the best plan. Send me a PSN invite or a message with your availability, and we'll get you added; I can hop on for like 5 minutes to take care of the invite almost anytime.Lasersmith, Bright Bear Laser Works [BrightBearLaser.com]LarryCPosted: November 12, 2019 3:49 AMPermalinkC for VendettaFrom the Gates of HellThings went great! I read up on our incompatibility issues and it's apparently an ISP or router thing. Something about the IPs not wanting to connect or somesuch. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting to reset and randomize the IP, but still couldn't join. We'll see next week if we can get everyone on. Good hunts, folks!\"...mahal ko ang longganisa!\" - DemosthenesDyniPosted: November 12, 2019 5:24 AMPermalinkMight makes RightFirelink ShrineYeah, good times! I have missed slapping things with my horn in multiplayer.It was a bummer that LarryC and I were seemingly unable to connect, but hopefully we can sort that out for next time. Thanks for letting me hop in for a bit And even though you said it was okay, sorry for stealing your spot!I need an \"I'm with Dyni\" t-shirt. -- Localgod54AtomicvideoheadPosted: November 12, 2019 4:52 PMPermalinkGoo Goo MuckNew EnglandI'll try to move up the monster ladder a bit more, so we can get a little more challenge than that poor poor nightshade.Long live the new flesh.PSN: videoheadsystemBeriAlphaPosted: November 17, 2019 9:49 PMPermalinkConsultantWoodland, CAIt's almost Monster Hunting Monday again! It's like this happens once a week.Monday, 5-8pm PST, 8-11pm EST, etc. On PS4.Join the squad session for Monster Hunter Mondays (not Hunters With Jobs). If you need to get into the squad, send me a message; I'm BeriAlpha here and on PSN. We'll do voice via PS4 party chat.Last week we had some networking issues; if you've seen something like \"Connection Error 50382-mw1\" you might look into some of the online troubleshooting guides. It looks like there's not one clear solution, but at the very least, I'd recommend everyone start Monday with a full restart of your PS4. It's good to do every now and then anyways.If our Xbox and PC brethren want to follow our lead, definitely do that!Lasersmith, Bright Bear Laser Works [BrightBearLaser.com]AtomicvideoheadPosted: November 18, 2019 4:21 PMPermalinkGoo Goo MuckNew EnglandI may be late tonight, have to deal with a tenant issue.Long live the new flesh.PSN: videoheadsystembobbywatsonPosted: November 19, 2019 1:06 AMPermalinkAssimilatory PhilologistOttawa, ON, CanadaCan't make it tonight, sorry.

I'm on, and just grinding the Hunter Helper pendants, which means dropping into low-rank quests like a tactical nuke and ripping some poor first-year student monsters in half.Lasersmith, Bright Bear Laser Works [BrightBearLaser.com]BeriAlphaPosted: November 19, 2019 2:44 AMPermalinkConsultantWoodland, CAMore connection shenanigans.Dyni: We have two more players on now, and SpinalShooter wasn't able to join up with us. If you'd like to try your luck joining in, we're in the Hunters With Jobs squad session right now.Lasersmith, Bright Bear Laser Works [BrightBearLaser.com]LarryCPosted: November 19, 2019 2:55 AMPermalinkC for VendettaFrom the Gates of HellYeah. I tried checking up on and adjusting my router settings and such. Still no dice. On the plus side, it looks like the connection issue is largely just with me - probably some idiosyncrasy with this particular network provider. As Dyni mentioned, when I'm playing at the other house, we're fine. I'll probably still check in and even watch, but I'll expect to only be able to join up when I'm on my other ISP network.\"...mahal ko ang longganisa!\" - DemosthenesAtomicvideoheadPosted: November 19, 2019 3:03 PMPermalinkGoo Goo MuckNew EnglandAfter Action report: connection issues persisted. Got a few good hunts in, moved me in Master Rank. Also Learned, MR or no, don't f*ck with Ancient Leshen! That F#$ker has some tricks up his sleeve that are hard to learn -- they're fairly subtle differences in reads, sparsely used in individual fights, and super damaging.Long live the new flesh.PSN: videoheadsystemBeriAlphaPosted: November 20, 2019 12:44 AMPermalinkConsultantWoodland, CAYeah, that fight is really about managing not to get one-shot. Or two-shot, or three-shot. But after that, easy!My lance build was doing pretty well, so if you're really interested in getting the Leshen's stuff in the next couple days, I think I can handle the Leshen while you hang out back at camp. But otherwise, I think we'll be just fine waiting for the event to cycle around again.Lasersmith, Bright Bear Laser Works [BrightBearLaser.com]AtomicvideoheadPosted: November 20, 2019 5:05 PMPermalinkGoo Goo MuckNew EnglandNah I'd rather get good.

The other ISP at the house was always good.I think both Dyni and I have already changed our NAT types. Just to avoid squadding up issues cropping up again, I'll delay getting on until 9 pm EST while everyone sets up and try to join once everyone else is in.\"...mahal ko ang longganisa!\" - DemosthenesStrayTanookiPosted: November 26, 2019 9:58 PMPermalinkOffice LinebackerPacific NWI'm not sure I'll make MHM tonight, or I might be late at least.Edit: I made it! At least for a bit.BeriAlphaPosted: November 26, 2019 5:28 AMPermalinkConsultantWoodland, CAReally fun stuff tonight, and a great turnout! We were around 5-6 players most of the evening. The extra player count allowed us to bounce around between endgame monster brawls and helping players get further through the Iceborne story.Connection issues kept LarryC from joining us again, but he stayed in party chat while I streamed the game to Twitch, so he could at least keep up with our hunts. I'll probably keep doing that each week: https://www.twitch.tv/berialpha/I definitely need to step up my game and start managing my items better; I feel like I have people counting on me now!Lasersmith, Bright Bear Laser Works [BrightBearLaser.com]LarryCPosted: November 26, 2019 5:40 AMPermalinkC for VendettaFrom the Gates of HellIf I can't join, I will at least ridicule those who fall in battle!Kidding. We don't bite. The monsters do that more than enough. Monster Hunter Mondays is going great, and with more content shortly on the way, it looks to be solid through at least until February, since I presume most people won't be on during the height of the Christmas holidays for various reasons.\"...mahal ko ang longganisa!\" - DemosthenesBeriAlphaPosted: November 26, 2019 8:16 AMPermalinkConsultantWoodland, CAOh, I also wanted to ask; if I stream this, what should my microphone settings be? No chat audio, only my chat audio, or audio from everyone in the party? I don't know if this would be of interest to Twitch, but my stream got up to >>FOUR<< viewers! And I only knew two of them already!Lasersmith, Bright Bear Laser Works [BrightBearLaser.com]AtomicvideoheadPosted: November 26, 2019 2:06 PMPermalinkGoo Goo MuckNew EnglandI'd share all audio, just let people know you're streaming. On PS4 you can manually set your mics so that it can or can't be shared by others.Long live the new flesh.PSN: videoheadsystemBeriAlphaPosted: December 1, 2019 2:01 AMPermalinkConsultantWoodland, CAThat's what I was leaning toward. My concern was less about privacy, since everyone can choose their own settings there, and more for the specific situation we had with Larry watching the stream and talking in chat, since he'd be getting the chat audio again several seconds later through Twitch unless he mutes it.I think I'm going to miss this Monday; I have an engagement that'll keep me away until right around 8 PST. But I'll get on then and see if anyone else is still around.Lasersmith, Bright Bear Laser Works [BrightBearLaser.com]DyniPosted: December 2, 2019 6:35 AMPermalinkMight makes RightFirelink ShrineI don't think I'll be able to make it this week either.
