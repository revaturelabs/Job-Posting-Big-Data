And they have some problems, like “drugs and attendant crime” that are of higher concern in areas where opioid and methamphetamine are more prevalent.The survey addressed a part of Texas than contains less than 15 percent of the state’s population, but 172 of its 254 counties. Their descriptions of what they like most about living where they are started with “rural” (33 percent) and included “neighbors/community” (17 percent), “peaceful/quiet” (13 percent) and “town size” (9 percent).Read more from The Texas Tribune.Please Share ThisTweetSharePlus onePin ItRelated ArticlesJunction ISD Students learn how to preserve our night skiesJunction ISD elementary, middle and high school students gathered recently at South Llano River State…Texas Water Symposium to Feature Regional Water Experts, June 18 in FredericksburgRegional Growth and Our State Water Planning Process: How You Can Get Involved The 8th…2,500-acre Veramendi development will bring 5,000 new homes to New BraunfelsNew Braunfels has been changing for years.
