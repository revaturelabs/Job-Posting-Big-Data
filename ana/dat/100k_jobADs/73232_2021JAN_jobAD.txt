"My Open Story for #101openstories – Fresh and CrispySkip to contentFresh and CrispyMore (or less) original insights from an old bloggerMenu	HomeAboutPosted on April 25, 2017 by cpjoblingMy Open Story for #101openstoriesAs an engineer with a keen interest in software development and the web I suppose I come to “Open” with a philosophy formed from my exposure to the Open Source Software movement. I remember reading Raymond’s The Cathedral to the Bazaar, and being fascinated by Richard Stallman, the Gnu Project, and his idea of Copyleft introduced by the Gnu General Public Licence (GPL). When it came to YouTube and Flickr, making my works available via a CC-BY licence seemed the right thing to do. On the web, I’ve used Wikipedia extensively (as you can see from this post) and would agree with others that it’s one of the greatest Open Educational Resources that exist. I have a source code repository on GitHub where the sharp eyed may find the odd teaching resource made available to the public without necessarily having the right permissions.As a practitioner, I suppose my Open Educational Practice began when I launched this Blog back in 2004. Fresh and Crispy (the name is a pun on my initials) was originally hosted on Blogspot. It has moved a couple of times to a various hosted WordPress and Ghost blogs on shared servers and virtual private servers before ending up hosted on WordPress, albeit with my domain name attached. Most of my early posts were around programming technologies like Java and Web applications. I joined Twitter in April 2007:Signing up for twitter.com— Chris Jobling (@cpjobling) April 11, 2007and a lot of my early tweets are about the Swansea Learning Lab, an early community of practice here at Swansea University. Here’s a typical (rather depressing) tweet:My Head of School thinks HE learning research is not \"RAEable\" can this be true? I was hoping it was! Any counter arguments?— Chris Jobling (@cpjobling) March 27, 2009I suppose a breakthrough for me came as a ed blogger came when I joined the Connectivist MOOC Plenk 2010 in September of that year.I remember being dragged in and becoming somewhat obsessive about curating the discussion boards in that MOOC — the evidence of which seems to have sadly disappeared — but I was honoured by being called a Meerkat by one of the participants:Hi everybody. This is Chris Jobling, Swansea University. Academic, #PLENK2010 scaffolder, meerkat and lab rat. Probably unqualified #lrnchat— Chris Jobling (@cpjobling) October 14, 2010I started tweet chats quite early, #lrnchat (still going strong) was one of the first as the tweet above testifies.Since then I’ve attended virtual ALT conferences, JISC and HEA events, been a participant and mentor on #BYOD4L, and an organizer on #LTHChat. and one or two further MOOCs.I find it difficult to reflect on what benefits there have been for me, but there must have been lots. It’s even more difficult to judge what impact I’ve had. But I must have gotten something out of it along with sufficient positive feedback from my virtual friends and real colleagues otherwise I wouldn’t continue to be engaged.Like this:Like Loading...CategoriesBlog, reflection Tags#101openstoriesPost navigationPrevious PostPrevious Drafts that will never get writtenNext PostNext Inclusion is the key to successful TELBlogrollBYOD4LLTHEChatSALTSearch for:SearchFollow me on TwitterMy TweetsJanuary 2021MTWTFSS1 2 34 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15 16 1718 19 20 21 22 23 2425 26 27 28 29 30 31« NovArchivesNovember 2020July 2020May 2020April 2020January 2020December 2019July 2019September 2018August 2018July 2018January 2018December 2017October 2017September 2017July 2017June 2017April 2017March 2017January 2017December 2016November 2016October 2016September 2016July 2016April 2016February 2016January 2016November 2015December 2014October 2014September 2014August 2014July 2014June 2014April 2014November 2013October 2013August 2013July 2013December 2012September 2012June 2012May 2012April 2012March 2012February 2012January 2012December 2011November 2011October 2011August 2011July 2011June 2011April 2011March 2011February 2011January 2011December 2010November 2010October 2010September 2010August 2010July 2010June 2010May 2010April 2010March 2010February 2010December 2009November 2009October 2009September 2009August 2009July 2009June 2009May 2009March 2009February 2009January 2009December 2008November 2008October 2008September 2008August 2008July 2008June 2008May 2008March 2008February 2008January 2008December 2007October 2007September 2007August 2007July 2007June 2007May 2007April 2007March 2007February 2007January 2007September 2006July 2006June 2006May 2006April 2006August 2005July 2005May 2005April 2005March 2005February 2005January 2005December 2004November 2004September 2004August 2004July 2004June 2004May 2004CategoriesCategories Select Category #12AoC #AdaLovelaceDay #altc #byod4l #codesign16 #FLble2 #GuildChat #HEAChat #HEblogswap #LTHEChat #OpenEdMOOC #SocialMediaStrike #SocMedHE16 #SocMedHE17 #susalt17 #susalt18 #susalt20 audience response Blackboard Learn Blog blogging Covid-19 cpd Curating Daily Sketch Educational Technology JISC Journal LTEC Moment ONCN as VLE OneNote online events open education OpenEdMOOC Photography reflection resource storify student engagement Swansea Swansea 2020 technology enhanced learning twitter Uncategorised Uncategorized vle Web TechnologyMore of meTwitterGoogle+GitHubCrispy DevMy Dokuwikijournal.cpjobling.netProudly powered by WordPress	%d bloggers like this:"
