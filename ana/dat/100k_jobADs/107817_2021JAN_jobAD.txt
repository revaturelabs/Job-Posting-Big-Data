Deadline reported that only 65 screens in 50 markets will be showing it.In addition to the silver screen, the film is available for streaming on iTunes (HD rental is $4.99), VUDU, Xbox Video and The PlayStation Store.Here’s the official trailer.The full list of online viewing options are available at the official website.“Jobs wanted what he wanted and would allow nothing to get in his way, even if what he wished was credit for work done by people who had faithfully supported him,” wrote CBSNews. Directed by Alex Gibney, the flick offers glimpse of a “bold, brilliant and brutal” Steve Jobs, as per the blurb.Very disappointed in SJ:Man in the Machine. An inaccurate and mean-spirited view of my friend. It's not a reflection of the Steve I knew.— Eddy Cue (@cue) March 16, 2015That official description, however, did not sit well with Apple’s Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue, who called it “an inaccurate and mean-spirited view of my friend” and ”not a reflection of the Steve I knew.”The promotional poster for the movie pictures Steve looking directly in the camera and striking the famous pose with his thumb touching his chin.“There’s been a lot of hagiography of Steve,” said director Alex Gibney in an interview with Re/code. “I don’t think that does justice to the man. So hopefully people will see it in that context.”“I’m appalled, really, by his cruelty, and his inability to get outside himself, and to see himself and his company in a broader perspective,” he continued.The film was produced in partnership with CNN Films and is being released by Magnolia Pictures.Will you be watching this documentary?Tagged:AppleMoviesSteve JobsMORE FROM iDBVideo: Steve Jobs predicted home premiere of movies still in theaters a decade agoPre-order Danny Boyle’s ‘Steve Jobs’ ahead of tomorrow’s release on iTunesWatch ‘Steve Jobs’ scene with Woz confronting Steve over impending launch of NeXT ComputerNewsletterGet updates directly into your inbox.SubscribeFeaturedLatestPriceBot, TV Remote, Onrise, and other apps to check out this weekendApple is reportedly testing in-screen Touch ID for 2021 iPhone, developing foldable iPhone prototypes, and AirTags may launch this yearThe best wallet cases for iPhone 12 (all models)How to launch an app with a keyboard shortcut on Mac“For All Mankind” season 2 trailer: Department of Defense moves into Mission ControlPriceBot, TV Remote, Onrise, and other apps to check out this weekendApple is reportedly testing in-screen Touch ID for 2021 iPhone, developing foldable iPhone prototypes, and AirTags may launch this yearThe best wallet cases for iPhone 12 (all models)Apple is now blocking M1 Mac users from sideloading iPhone and iPad appsWhatsApp is delaying its privacy policy update following feedback due to Facebook data sharingJailbreak NewsDoes the Chimera jailbreak work on the newly released iOS 12.5.1?SmartVolumeMixer2 offers seamless control over all your iPhone’s different volume levelsStarscape: A curious new aesthetic for banner notifications on jailbroken handsetsSubstitute picks up more minor changes in new v2.0.5 updateGet Lottie-style notification banner animations on your jailbroken iPhone with LottieNotificationsAppsPriceBot, TV Remote, Onrise, and other apps to check out this weekendApple is now blocking M1 Mac users from sideloading iPhone and iPad appsHow to view apps using your Apple ID for “Sign in with Apple”Jailbreakers can customize their Home Screen’s app icon labels with Labels+The best apps for car shopping on iPhone and iPadAccessoriesThe best wallet cases for iPhone 12 (all models)This popular wireless charging pad is down to $9Belkin recalls the Portable Wireless Charger and Stand over fire hazardThe best eco-friendly cases for the iPhone 12 lineupReview: The Logitech Circle View Doorbell features great hardware only limited by HomeKitPodcastLet’s Talk iOS 378: Alive and wellChanges are coming to the Let’s Talk iOS podcast and we want to hear from youTwitter snaps up Breaker, a podcast app focused on social interactionLet’s Talk iOS 377: A solution in search of a problemAmazon has acquired podcasting company WonderyDealsVerv Premium Home Workout Planner: Lifetime Subscription for $39 The Complete 2021 QuickBooks Bootcamp Bundle for $29 Dell 11.6\" Chromebook 3120, 4GB RAM 16GB - Black (Refurbished) for $187Download the iDB appAbout | Contact | Disclosure | Privacy | Unsubscribe2021 © iDownloadBlog.com - This website is not affiliated with Apple.HomeAppsTutorialsJailbreak NewsJailbreak TweaksDownloadsWallpapersAccessoriesDealsPodcastsWrite for iDBContact Us"
