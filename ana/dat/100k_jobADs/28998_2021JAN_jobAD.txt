However, there is increased competition facing UK universities from higher education institutions in emerging economies across the world, particularly Asia-Pacific institutions.There are 24 Asian universities in the top 200 this year compared to 20 last year.The UK has to match competitors. Without increased investment and less regulation, the UK's best universities might lose their place as world leaders.Back to topslapntickleJoined: 07 Sep 2010Posts: 270Posted: Fri Oct 03, 2014 2:48 pm Post subject:Dedicated wrote:The UK has to match competitors. Without increased investment and less regulation, the UK's best universities might lose their place as world leaders.\"Might lose their place?\" Don't you mean \"will\"? The best British universities have been around for centuries and therefore have had a traditional advantage over the so-called emerging economies. Nevertheless, within a few decades these economies have started to overtake the UK and the trend suggests nothing will change. The fact is that a British education doesn't cut the mustard in today's world like it used to. Students vote with their feet, and many are deciding that a tertiary education in another part of the world is cheaper and a damned sight better.Back to topSashadroogieJoined: 17 Apr 2007Posts: 11061Location: Moskva, The Workers' ParadisePosted: Sat Oct 04, 2014 10:35 am Post subject:Might be wrong here, but many emerging economies don't have the same reputation of reliability and trustworthiness as a UK university enjoys. Rightly or wrongly, I think the notion that you can't just bribe your tutors or uni admin staff to get high marks and qualify will continue to draw to the UK overseas students who are interested in getting a solid education with a degree that matters. At least, that is the view I have influenced by the workings of the tertiary sectors I've worked in elsewhere.No pace for complacency, but I don't think UK unis are in too much danger.Back to topDedicatedJoined: 18 May 2007Posts: 972Location: UKPosted: Sat Oct 04, 2014 2:32 pm Post subject:I totally agree with Sasha.slapntickle wrote:Quote:students vote with their feet, and many are deciding that a tertiary education in another part of the world is cheaper and a damned sight betterSo where are all the students going exactly? Where is \" a damned sight better\"?According to the 2012-2013 ukcisa statistics, there are almost half a million overseas students studying in the UK., despite the stricter visa regulations. 71% of full time postgraduates and 49% of full time research degrees are being done by overseas students in the UK. They presumably realize the value of a UK degree having invested about 3.9 billion pounds in fees and 6.3 billion in living costs.Back to topslapntickleJoined: 07 Sep 2010Posts: 270Posted: Thu Oct 09, 2014 10:28 pm Post subject:Dedicated wrote:So where are all the students going exactly? Where is \" a damned sight better\"?Research shows that since the raise in tuition fees, students are voting with their feet and going to other countries to study. The point is that students are being asked to spend more on a British education that is often seen as lacking in quality. Being savvy 'consumers', students are looking elsewhere to get a greater bang for their buck. Take a look at this article from The Independent:http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/tuition-fee-hike-blamed-as-international-students-at-uk-universities-fall-by-a-quarter-9231151.htmlBack to topDedicatedJoined: 18 May 2007Posts: 972Location: UKPosted: Fri Oct 10, 2014 4:07 pm Post subject:The Independent article attributes the 25% slump in EU undergraduate students to the fact that students from EU countries are on an equal footing with UK students and have to pay fees with no entitlement to loans. University courses in most of the EU are cheaper than in the UK, but nowhere does it say their quality is better - just cheaper.There has been a dramatic fall in enrolments from India and Pakistan as a result of 700 bogus colleges being closed and visa regulations tightened up.' Many international students feel unwelcome in the UK as a result of the Government's hostile and overzealous immigration policies\".However, this slump has been offset by a huge rise from China. Overall, the number of international students enrolling on undergraduate courses is still rising partially offsetting the decline in EU recruitment.London has just topped a survey measuring attractiveness for innovation and business, which means the ability to attract the best and the brightest from all over the world. London has more universities in the global top 20 than any other city in the world. Quality education is not cheap.Back to topslapntickleJoined: 07 Sep 2010Posts: 270Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2014 4:53 pm Post subject:Dedicated wrote:Quality education is not cheap.True, but is it quality? That's what students are asking themselves. Actually, a lot of my Master's students don't seem too bothered about quality. All they seem concerned about is the fact that they can graduate in just one year - it's two in the US - and get that piece of paper which will help them secure a job and a high salary. If we're really honest about this, many international students that are graduating from our universities have questionable skills upon graduation. What is more their English is atrocious too. It seems to me that all universities and students really care about today is money. Many of these students who are not bright enough or rich enough to attend a university ranked in the top 10 are merely purchasing a degree . . . and British universities are quite happy to 'sell' shoddy products to these 'consumers'. If this isn't bogus, I don't know what is.Back to topscot47Joined: 10 Jan 2003Posts: 15343Posted: Tue Oct 14, 2014 2:50 pm Post subject:The US is a cheaper place to live in.Back to topDisplay posts from previous: All Posts1 Day7 Days2 Weeks1 Month3 Months6 Months1 Year Oldest FirstNewest FirstJob Discussion Forums Forum Index -> United Kingdom All times are GMTPage 1 of 1Jump to: Select a forum Where to Begin----------------General DiscussionNewbie ForumCurrent Events ForumTechnology ForumOnline Teaching Forum Africa Forums----------------General Africa Forum Asia Forums----------------CambodiaChina (Job-related Posts Only)China (Off-Topic)Hong KongIndiaIndonesiaJapanMalaysiaPhilippinesSingaporeTaiwanThailandGeneral Asia ForumVietnam Caribbean Forums----------------General Caribbean Forum Europe Forums----------------Czech RepublicFranceGermanyGreeceItalyMacedonia and the BalkansPolandRomaniaRussia & C.I.S.SpainTurkeyUkraineUnited KingdomGeneral Europe Forum Latin America Forums----------------ArgentinaBrazilChileColombiaCosta RicaMexicoMexico (off-topic)PeruGeneral Latin America Forum The Middle East Forums----------------BahrainEgyptIsraelKuwaitOmanQatarSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesGeneral Middle East Forum North America Forums----------------General North America Forum Oceania----------------Australia/New ZealandYou cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forumThis page is maintained by the one and only Dave Sperling.Contact Dave's ESL CafeCopyright © 2018 Dave Sperling.
