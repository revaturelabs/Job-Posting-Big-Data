Find One on Xpressteachersby Christie Uzebu4 years agoin Startups3 min read0There’s quite a large number of job boards in Nigeria, helping job seekers ease their job search process. On each of these sites are vacancies for different professions, and we’re yet to find one dedicated to a single profession.But if you’re in the teaching field, you don’t need to keep going from page to page in search of a job role that fits your career. You can now use Xpressteachers.Launched by Vivian Paseda on the 1st of April 2016, Xpressteachers is a job posting board solely dedicated to the recruitment of educational personnel.The platform allows educational establishments to place their vacancies for free, while jobseekers who find a vacancy matching their search criteria can also apply directly to the organisation.The platform also has a CV database, where educational professionals seeking employment post their CVs, and in the same vein, registered employers can browse through the CV database and make direct contact with candidates that match their vacancy criteria.For Xpressteachers, the goal is to streamline the recruitment process, thus reducing the stress, time and cost associated with recruiting quality candidates.Being a niche focused job board, Xpressteachers is not only making job search easier for educational professionals, but also easing the recruitment process for employers, given the fact that they can search through a database, rather than posting a vacancy and receiving hundreds of CVs that they might not even be satisfied.Related postsNigeria’s uLesson raises $7.5m series A for expansion into Eastern & Southern AfricaJanuary 19, 20210This VC firm is Calling for Changes to Cut-and-paste VC Strategy In AfricaJanuary 18, 20210Tizeti rolls out high-speed 4G LTE in Edo with N4000/month broadband serviceJanuary 18, 20210Copia Kenya hosts MIT Global Entrepreneurship Lab projectJanuary 18, 20210Theoffering of Xpressteachers is highly commendable, and we can’t wait to see how it scales.READ Microsoft & Jobberman partner to help Aiki.ng address the African Unemployment ProblemReaders 1,037ShareClick to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)MoreClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...RelatedTags: NigeriaSTARTUPxpressteachersChristie UzebuRelated PostsEducationNigeria’s uLesson raises $7.5m series A for expansion into Eastern & Southern AfricaJanuary 19, 20210StartupsThis VC firm is Calling for Changes to Cut-and-paste VC Strategy In AfricaJanuary 18, 20210StartupsTizeti rolls out high-speed 4G LTE in Edo with N4000/month broadband serviceJanuary 18, 20210StartupsCopia Kenya hosts MIT Global Entrepreneurship Lab projectJanuary 18, 20210EntrepreneurshipAdam Molai’s JUA Kickstarter Fund Doubles to $2M to Kickstart African EntrepreneurshipJanuary 15, 20210StartupsNigeria’s TeamApt pivots to serve consumers, eyes expansion into West & North AfricaJanuary 14, 20210BusinessCellulant Group CEO Ken Njoroge to step down in JuneJanuary 14, 20210StartupsOZÉ Raises $700k To Digitize African MSMEs & Offer Them Affordable CapitalJanuary 14, 20210ADVERTISEMENTJoin our Mailing ListName*Email*Recent PostsNigeria’s uLesson raises $7.5m series A for expansion into Eastern & Southern AfricaJanuary 19, 2021Huawei’s connected ecosystem sets the building blocks for the upcoming connected futureJanuary 19, 2021Tatu City Partners with Konza to Attract Investors to KenyaJanuary 19, 20214 Science-Backed Benefits of Having a DogJanuary 19, 2021SEO for Beginners: Where to Start and What You NeedJanuary 19, 2021\">\">Follow Us\">There are many sites out there focused on blowing off some steam, from funny entertainment to thrilling experiences like playing online, in some cases online gaming could grant you the chance to win extra money.
