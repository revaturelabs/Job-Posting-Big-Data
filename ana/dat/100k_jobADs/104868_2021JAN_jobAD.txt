The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 1.33% for the week. The MSCI EAFE Index, which tracks developed stock markets overseas, rose 1.24%.[1][2][3]Stocks Lose MomentumStocks marched higher to begin the week on progress with a COVID-19 vaccine and a string of upbeat corporate quarterly reports. Firming oil prices and the passage of a fiscal stimulus bill by the European Union also helped buoy investors' spirits.Market sentiment, however, turned negative after Thursday morning's report of an uptick in new unemployment claims, which suggested a possible slowdown in hiring. The market was led lower by the technology sector ahead of quarterly reports from some of the sector's biggest names.[4]U.S.-China Tensions EscalateTensions escalated last week as the U.S. ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, which the White House claimed was stealing American information. A day earlier, the U.S. had accused China of attempting to steal COVID-19 research data. China responded by ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in the city of Chengdu.[5][6]The markets appear more focused on the apparent deteriorating relations between the two nations, worried about a repeat of the trade battle in 2018. Whether the rancor is managed is likely to remain a top concern for investors in the weeks ahead.Final ThoughtsThe mega-cap technology companies' market dominance is a concern to some. Last week it was reported that six of these mega-cap stocks represent 41% of the Nasdaq market capitalization.Five mega-cap names included in the S&P 500 Index account for 22% of that index's market capitalization.[7]Investors have embraced these firms because they appear to be able to show solid financial performance in the midst of an economy coping with COVID-19.THIS WEEK: KEY ECONOMIC DATAMonday: Durable Goods Orders.Wednesday: Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Meeting Announcement.Thursday: Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Jobless Claims.Friday: Consumer Sentiment.Source: Econoday, July 24, 2020The Econoday economic calendar lists upcoming U.S. economic data releases (including key economic indicators), Federal Reserve policy meetings, and speaking engagements of Federal Reserve officials.
