The actual kickback period is 24 centimeters.Likely learners are 6 and 10% in the field of finance and the accreditation.The problem addressed by this practice is the inability of start-ups to get funding to start a business. For each of the IFI's products, there is an opportunity to finance \"start-ups\", as well as micro and small businesses without credit history.The key players are IFI Jobs, regional representatives with whom MFI Jobs works and the \"start-ups\" themselves.Beneficiaries are start-ups and micro and small businesses that have no access to normal bank funding.Resources neededHuman resources are 12 employees of IFI Jobs. There is no budget limit.Evidence of successIFI Jobs has funded 80 start-up companies that, without the funding provided, could not obtain credit from other banks or other lending institutions.Difficulties encounteredThe main difficulties and challenges relate to the need to constantly educate and explain the people running start-ups about the funding requirements and building a good partnership and a direct and lasting relationship with them. Creating trust is also very important.Potential for learning or transferGood practice is easy to apply because the risk of losing on similar loans - for startup companies - is actually quite low - less than 10%.Tags: Support, SME, Micro, FinanceProjectINNOGROWMain institutionThe Microfinance Institution \"Jobs\".LocationСеверозападен, Bulgaria (България)Start DateJanuary 2010End DateOngoingFurther informationContactMihaela DinevaPlease login to contact the author.Send a messageYour message*You must enter a messageThere was an error sending the mail.Your mail has been sent.Please check the recaptcha field below.CloseSend emailSHARESitemapPolicy Learning PlatformCommunityExpert supportKnowledge hubWhat is Policy Learning Platform?Copyright © 2021 Interreg Europe (GECOTTI-PE) | Les Arcuriales, Entrée D, 5e étage, 45 rue de Tournai, 59000 Lille, FranceLegal notice & privacy policy"
