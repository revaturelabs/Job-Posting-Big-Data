Very hot. To get a sense for how popular this industry is among up-and-coming young professionals, go to any college campus and mention that you work in the industry. Chances are, you’ll be there for the day talking to people about jobs.This past weekend, I was at Cornell University for the Net Impact conference where I hosted a couple panels. After both of the discussions, the panelists were surrounded by eager business students and professionals looking to find their way into renewables or cleantech. You could feel the passion in the air – people see the incredible opportunities this industry represents, and they want in. Almost every conversation I had at the conference was related to jobs, jobs, jobs.These weren’t just ordinary people though. Everyone I talked to seemed to have a deep understanding of the industry. I was blown away by the intelligence and passion from the students and professionals who approached me. It seems everywhere I go, I run into the same type of people.This industry is attracting the best and brightest minds from all over the world, and that gives me a lot of hope. ::continue::However, it should also be a wake-up call to anyone looking to get in the industry. For every job out there, there are thousands of other highly-qualified, motivated prospects like you. That means that competition is getting fierce, especially given the limited amount of jobs because of the recession.I get a lot of questions from people about where the jobs are. The truth is, they’re everywhere. I see jobs open all the time in manufacturing, sales, installation, maintenance and finance. The problem is, there are simply more and more people competing for those jobs every day. Renewable energy is no longer a niche industry. It is a highly competitive global market that is attracting the best and brightest minds.If you ever get a chance to go to an energy-related event at a university, I recommend it. You’ll soon understand how competitive the talent pool is getting. This competition may make it harder for you to find your dream job, but it will certainly mean good things for the future of renewables.For more information on finding or posting renewable energy jobs, make sure you check out our jobs board.MoreHydropower	Preliminary permit issued for 1,500-MW Salt River Project Indian Spring Pumped Storage ProjectRooftop	Forget DER aggregators, grid-edge intelligence will be the hallmark of the utility of the futureEnergy Efficiency	All new homes in Wales to be powered by clean energy from 2025Wind Power	Ørsted, Equinor spearhead global coalition to boost offshore windSkip to indexThe Latest in Green Energy News	ResourcesAbout UsAdvertiseMagazine Issue ArchiveRSS FeedsSubscribeCLARION ENERGY MEDIAElectric Light & Power Executive DigestHydro ReviewPower EngineeringPower Engineering InternationalPOWERGRID InternationalRenewable Energy WorldSmart Energy InternationalPOWER & ENERGY EVENT SERIESAfrican Utility WeekDISTRIBUTECH InternationalEnlit AsiaEnlit AustraliaEnlit EuropeFuture Energy East AfricaFuture Energy NigeriaHYDROVISION InternationalIndian Utility WeekPOWERGEN AfricaPOWERGEN IndiaPOWERGEN InternationalPrivacy PolicyCopyright © 2019 - 2021	We value your privacy.
