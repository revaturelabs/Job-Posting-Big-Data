It was the biggest store in the world: you could get anything there.The boss asked him, \"Have you ever been a salesman before?\"\"Yes sir !The boss liked him and said, \"You can start tomorrow. Learn fast and do well.\"The first working day was long and arduous for Sardar ji but he got through it.Finally 6 pm came around. The boss duly fronted up and asked, \"How many sales did you make today?\"\"Sir, I made ONE sale!\" said Sardar ji rather happily.\"Only one sale?!\" shot back the boss. \"No! No! You see, most of my staff make 20 or 30 sales a day.If you want to keep this job, you'd better be doing better than just one sale.By the way, how much was your sale worth?\"\"$933005,\" said Sardar ji .\"What?! How did you manage that?\" asked the flabbergasted boss.\"Well,\" said Sardar ji , \"this man came in and I sold him a small fish hook, then a medium hook and finally a really large hook.Then I sold him a good fishing rod and some fishing gear.Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast.So I told him he'd be needing a boat, so I took him down to the boat department and sold him that 20-foot schooner with the twin engines.Then he said his Volkswagen wouldn't be able to carry it, so I took him to our automotive department and sold him that new Deluxe 4X4 Blazer.I then asked him where he'll be staying and since he had not decided, I took him to camping department and sold him a six-sleeper camper tent.Then he said I should throw in about $200 worth of groceries and two cases of beer.\"The boss took two steps back and asked in astonishment, \"You sold all that to a guy who came in for a fish hook?!\"\"No, sir,\" answered Sardar ji, \"he came in to buy a headache relief tablet and I convinced him that fishing is the best remedy for headache.\"Boss: \"Where did you work?!\"\"MEDICAL REPRESENTATIVE IN A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY IN INDIA, SIR\"Boss: \"Please take my chair.\"That's the Power of an Indian SARDAR. Never take him for a joke alone.(American Polish jokes are on Sikhs in India)Newer Post Older Post HomeVisitorsTranslate This PageSearchTony Thampi, c.s.c.Saint Andre HomeOff Bannarghetta RoadBangalore 56008394488-04865:tk@tkayala.comWant to receive New Posts right into your inbox?
