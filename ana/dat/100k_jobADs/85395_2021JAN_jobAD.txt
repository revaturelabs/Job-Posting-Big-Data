Republicans opposing the legislation said the measure should be paid for by cutting unspent money from last year's economic stimulus bill.The White House criticized [COLOR=#366388 ! important][COLOR=#366388 ! important]Congress[/COLOR][/COLOR] for failing to renew unemployment benefits with the holiday break approaching.\"I don't think we want to leave here having fought for tax cuts for millionaires and against unemployment insurance for those that have lost their jobs,\" [COLOR=#366388 ! important][COLOR=#366388 ! important]spokesman [COLOR=#366388 ! important]Robert [/COLOR][COLOR=#366388 ! important]Gibbs[/COLOR][/COLOR][/COLOR] said.Democrats brought the measure to the floor under fast-track rules that required a two-thirds vote to pass, so the measure fell despite winning a 258-154 majority. Republicans blasted the move since it denied them an opportunity to try to offset its cost.\"The fact is, we can both provide this help and pay for it by cutting less effective stimulus spending,\" said Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La. \"That's what we should be debating today.\"Efforts to renew federally paid jobless benefits for people who have been out of work for more than half a year has bedeviled Congress for much of the year.Every recession since 1950 has featured an extended federal benefits program financed with deficit dollars. That's a precedent Democrats refused to break when battling with Republicans for months earlier this year to extend the program.Republicans didn't pay any political price for stalling efforts earlier this year to extend jobless benefits that provide critical help to the unemployed — including a seven-week stretch over the summer when jobless benefits were a piece of a failed Democratic tax and [COLOR=#366388 ! important][COLOR=#366388 ! important]jobs [COLOR=#366388 ! important]bill[/COLOR][/COLOR][/COLOR].But allowing benefits to expire in the holiday season may draw negative attention to Republicans, especially when measured against their insistence that tax cuts for upper-income taxpayers not be allowed to expire.\"We have never cut off benefits for out-of-work Americans where the [COLOR=#366388 ! important][COLOR=#366388 ! important]unemployment [COLOR=#366388 ! important]rates[/COLOR][/COLOR][/COLOR] have been this high,\" said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. \"Without this extension, temporary federal extended benefits will shut down ... denying benefits to two million of our fellow citizens over the holiday season.\"Senate Democrats say they have no plans to bring the measure up as a stand-alone bill, but efforts to renew benefits are likely to get drawn into negotiations over taxes and other important year-end legislation.\"We will continue to work for an emergency short-term extension to get families through the holidays,\" promised [COLOR=#366388 ! important][COLOR=#366388 ! important]House [COLOR=#366388 ! important]Speaker [/COLOR][COLOR=#366388 ! important]Nancy [/COLOR][COLOR=#366388 ! important]Pelosi[/COLOR][/COLOR][/COLOR], D-Calif.Reply With Quote11-18-2010, 04:58 PM #2swampratView ProfileView Forum PostsPrivate MessageStaffJoin DateAug 2006LocationHouston, TXPosts3,126Goodbye social safety net.
