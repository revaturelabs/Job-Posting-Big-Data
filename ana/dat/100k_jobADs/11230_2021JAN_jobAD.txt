Although our warehouse is fully air-conditioned, these more fragile items are put in cold storage (freezer or refrigeration unit) for maximum freshness.Our receiving department does its best to verify and then enter the correct expiration dates for all incoming products. However, discrepancies do occur from time to time. This being said, the exceptionally high turnover at iHerb ensures that our inventory is among the freshest in the industry.Date First Available: January 2014Shipping Weight:?0.18 lbsSwitch to Metric unitsShipping WeightThe Shipping Weight includes the product, protective packaging material and the actual shipping box. In addition, the Shipping Weight may be adjusted for the Dimensional Weight (e.g. length, width & height) of a package. It is important to note that certain types of products (e.g. glass containers, liquids, fragile, refrigerated or ice packed) will often require protective packaging material. As such, these products will reflect a higher Shipping Weight compared to the unprotected product.Product Code: DES-22005UPC Code: 718334220055Package Quantity: 2 fl ozDimensions:4.3 x 1.2 x 1 in, 0.15 lbsSwitch to Metric unitsProduct Rank:#8 in Jojoba >#16 in Carrier Oils >Frequently Purchased TogetherCustomers Also ViewedProduct OverviewDescriptionFor Hair, Skin and ScalpNon GMO Project VerifiedGluten FreeNo Chemical Processing or Additives24 Hour MoistureCertified B CorporationCruelty FreeVeganCold PressedNo Ordinary Oil™ 100% Pure Golden Goodness - nothing added!
