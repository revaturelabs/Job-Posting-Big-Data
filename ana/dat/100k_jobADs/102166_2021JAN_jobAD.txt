So, this is a new beginning. With this kind of partnership, we hope to achieve a lot for the state and the nation,” Governor Ambode said.While fielding questions from journalists, the Governor assured that the project would be completed before the celebration of 50 years anniversary of the state next year, and that the whole idea was also aimed at bringing consciousness of the people to the historical facts about the state and the nation.He added: “Again, we are not just doing this because we plan to complete the new museum for the Lagos@50 celebration, but this is more or less a legacy for the state government.L-R: Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode; Minister of Information, Culture & Tourism, Alhaji Lai Mohammed; Commissioner for Tourism, Arts & Culture, Mr. Folorunsho Folarin Coker and the Director General, National Commission for Museums & Monuments, Mallam Abdallah Yusuf during a joint inspection visit to the National Museum, Onikan, Lagos, on Monday, March 07, 2016.“We actually have a program called THEAS which stands for Tourism, Hospitality, Entertainment and Arts and Sports for excellence but the truth of the matter is that this is not only about revenue generation; it is about job creation. My emphasis is about creating jobs for the lower strata and that is where you are going to get all our athletes, the younger ones, our drivers, our artisans and so on to be busy and keep them moving by combining everything that we have from sports, from tourism and so on and before you know it, the GDP of Lagos grows,” the Governor said.On his part, Mohammed assured that he would spare nothing in ensuring that the project is a reality, and that serious efforts would be put in place to ensure the completion within the stipulated time frame.He commended Governor Ambode for walking the talk barely two weeks after promising to transform the museum to world-class, saying the project was the biggest collaboration so far between the state and federal government on tourism and culture.The Minister added: “For the Governor to come here today is eloquent confirmation that he is ready to walk his talk. What we are aiming up for here is another hub for culture, another hub for arts and another hub for entertainment and if you look at the location of this National Museum, this is where the history of Nigeria started.R-L: Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode; Minister of Information, Culture & Tourism, Alhaji Lai Mohammed; Director General, National Commission for Museums & Monuments, Mallam Abdallah Yusuf and Commissioner for Tourism, Arts & Culture, Mr. Folorunsho Folarin Coker during a joint inspection visit to the National Museum, Onikan, Lagos, on Monday, March 07, 2016.“Around us here are historical monuments and what we are trying to do about it is to bring all these historical monuments like the lsland Club, like the Yoruba Tennis Club and the old Brazilian culture together in a lovely form and I must again thank the Governor of Lagos State for not just his generosity but for the vision.“He has looked at the big picture not just the small picture. He is not looking at four years or eight years but he is looking at what legacy can we bequeath for Nigeria and Nigerians and I can assure you that this is one project that will be devoid of bureaucracy. We already have a timeline within which to achieve this and the fact that the Governor is here just in two weeks after his promise to transform the National Museum speaks volume about his intention,” Mohammed said.share0 0 0Previous : CHRIS BROWN TO RELEASE HIS CLOTHING LABELNext : TRCN Inducts First UNICAL Institute of Education GraduatesAbout The AuthorOpeyemi idrisRelated postsNIMC says it has Licensed Telcom Companies to provide NINJanuary 27, 2021Yabatech Loses Director to COVID, Shuts hostelJanuary 27, 2021Nollywood actor Ernest Asuzu is deadJanuary 27, 2021Nollywood actor Ernest Asuzu is deadJanuary 27, 2021(0) CommentsRead more...Funke Akindele’s ‘Omo Ghetto’ becomes highest grossing Nollywood movieJanuary 26, 2021(0) CommentsRead more...Tunde Ednut recovers Instagram accountJanuary 22, 2021(0) CommentsRead more...[Grammy(R) award-winning global sensation DJ Khaled will be International Host of the MTVJanuary 22, 2021(0) CommentsRead more...MTV Base premieres “Celebrity Bumps”, a new reality TV show starring BBNaija’s Mike Edwards and wife, PerriJanuary 19, 2021(0) CommentsRead more...SOCIALIZEFacebook 1.1KFansTwitter 0FollowersInstagram 0FollowersYoutube 0SubscriberAcadaExtra BlogVideo of the weekAcada ExtraAcada Extra Magazine is a lifestyle magazine for campus students and youth with the following contents, campus news entertainments, interviews, sports, lifestyle, features and coverage of various activities of events across campuses in Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin.We reach millions of youths worldwide via our free bi-weekly publication, Website, Facebook and Twitter.FollowRandom postsNIMC says it has Licensed Telcom Companies to provide NINJanuary 27, 2021(0) CommentsRead more...Yabatech Loses Director to COVID, Shuts hostelJanuary 27, 2021(0) CommentsRead more...Nollywood actor Ernest Asuzu is deadJanuary 27, 2021(0) CommentsRead more...TwitterContact UsFor inquiries and adverts:Upper floor Jowon Plaza,16 Tinubu Road, by Ilupeju Road,Ilupeju, Palmgrove, Lagos.Advert Hotline: +2348080203344, +2348084809400, +2348028605025NewsletterGet Journal good news straight to your email.NewsGistEntertainmentCampus ZoneOpportunitiesVideoAudioMobile PhonesNewsEntertainmentCampus ZoneAcada TVOpportunitiesAcada TVOpportunitiesVideoAudioGistEntertainmentCampus ZoneAcada TVCampus ZoneAcada TVOpportunitiesVideoPagesMagazineMediaweatherAdvertisingWorld CupNbaNFLNHLHomeTypographyRTL ExampleDocumentationContact USCopyright © 2014 by ACADAEXTRA.
