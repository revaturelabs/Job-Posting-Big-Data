All 73 bedrooms have en-suite shower rooms and are located in six separate areas over three floors, each of which has their own communal lounge and dining room to foster family-style communities, while also providing space in which to eat and relax.As part of the emphasis on enabling community involvement and combating isolation, facilities also include indoor garden areas, an on-site hairdresser and a community café and coffee shop.“We’re excited to be welcoming our first residents to Abbey House, a new state-of-the-art care home which will play an important role in meeting the demand for quality care for the elderly, particularly those living with dementia, in Swindon,” said Erica Pryce, registered nurse manager at Abbey House.“With the town’s population growing faster than the national average – and the number of those aged over 75 rising by 4-5 per cent each year – local health and social care services are under severe pressure. While it is possible to develop dementia early in life, the chances of doing so increase dramatically with age, so it is vital that this need for high quality, specialist care is addressed by the opening of new care homes such as Abbey House.”She added: “Our recruitment drive continues as we look to fill roles that will support all aspects of life at the home, which will include a mixture of full and part-time positions. This is an opportunity to take on a highly rewarding position that can make a real difference to people’s lives.”Abbey House will specialise in providing both residential and nursing care for people across the dementia spectrum, from those who are physically active, to people who may have medical conditions complicated by living with dementia requiring nursing care and those who require end of life care.The launch comes as Milestones Trust, the charity which is behind Abbey House, celebrates its 30th anniversary and long history of providing care and support to vulnerable people with learning disabilities, mental health needs and dementia in the South West.TAGS#featuredAbbey HouseMilestones TrustFacebookTwitterLinkedinEditorRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORKnight Frank launches fifth edition of prestigious annual UK Luxury Care Home GuideCare home lockdown constraints strengthen staff teamsCare provider expands Essex presence with launch of new branchLEAVE A REPLY Cancel replyPlease enter your comment!Please enter your name hereYou have entered an incorrect email address!Please enter your email address hereSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
