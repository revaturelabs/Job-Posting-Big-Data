Get your utility bill out and figure that amount up every month! Here are some ideas and tips for helping you save that money.We will be happy to come out and do these steps for you professionally and quickly – or you can attempt them yourself. (Be sure to call us if you run into any issues though!)#1. Inspect your ducts, the air filters, the blower and motor, and the indoor coil for dirt and other obstructions, as well as any problems with wiring, strange smells etc.#2. Look for any air leaks and repair in the ductwork.#3. Measure your airflow for proper amounts and repair any issues found.#4. Check the refrigerant charge. (Often we found too little or too much in the charge. Both can have a detrimental effect of running costs as well as machinery life.)#5. Check for refrigerant leaks – especially when your charge is low.#6. Thoroughly inspect all electric terminals, checking for clean and tight connections. Mice and little critters love insulation on electrical wiring.#7. If called for, lubricate motors, and check fan belts for proper adjustment and wear.#8. Verify correct thermostat operation, including all electric control. Make sure heating is locked out when the thermostat calls for cooling and vice versa.Other Tips for Heat Pump Maintenance and Proper OperationBe careful not to raise the thermostat setting too quickly. This can cause the backup electrical heating to come on which is very expensive. We do not recommend leaving your fan on all the time. Keep the setting on “auto” on the thermostat. A programmable thermostat with multistage functions suitable for a heat pump helps reduce costs as well.Keep you filters clean! Change filters once a month or as needed. Dirty filters, coils, and fans reduce airflow through the system, increasing costs, and can even damage your system’s compressor. Clean outdoor coils whenever they appear dirty. Maintain cleanliness around your supply and return registers in your home, and straighten their fins if bent to keep the air moving freely and clean.Heat Pump Maintenance is not rocket science but probably more important to your daily life – so be prepared to do it yourself or call us to come get ‘er done!Recent PostsHeat Pumps and Common ProblemsAdd Equity When You Upgrade Your HVACHow to Choose an AC SystemDon’t Be Caught with Dirty Sock SyndromeWill an Air Purifier Help Maintain Indoor Air Quality?CategoriesAir ConditioningCarbon Monoxide DetectorsFurnaceHeat PumpHigh Efficiency Gas FurnaceHot Water HeaterHVAC systemsSmart Home DevicesSwamp CoolersUncategorizedOn a Mobile?We Accept:Service You Can Trust!Copyright © 2019 Polar Heating and Refrigeration, 2057 Clearwater Loop NE, Rio Rancho, New Mexico, 87144 Privacy Policy"
