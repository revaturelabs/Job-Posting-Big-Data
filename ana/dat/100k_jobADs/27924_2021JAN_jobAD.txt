E. Shaw group are at the core of our discretionary investment strategies, and we’re looking to train motivated and unique individuals to contribute to the team during this coming summer. Among a diverse group of colleagues composed of published authors, entrepreneurs, opera singers, International Math and Physics Olympiad medalists, and many others, trader interns will take on complex challenges that are ever changing and reach far beyond the world of finance.What you’ll do day-to-day:Since our approach sits at the intersection of finance and technology, our traders employ a number of technological platforms to analyze market data and ultimately make qualitative decisions based on this analysis.
