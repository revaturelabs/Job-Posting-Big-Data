Andrew Holness, says the economic and structural reforms being undertaken by the Government are delivering real jobs for Jamaicans.He said the increase in employment over the last two quarters has been “fantastic” and “in the closing quarter we will be seeing (even) more jobs”.The Prime Minister was contributing to a debate on the Bill to repeal the Road Maintenance Fund Act in the House of Representatives on Tuesday (November 14).The Bill, which was passed, provides for the closure of the Fund and assimilation of its functions into the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation. The move is expected to result in savings to the Government of approximately $35 million.The closure of the Fund is part of Government’s public sector reform agenda aimed at reducing bureaucracy and improving efficiency in order to stimulate private-sector investment and job creation.“We (are) looking clinically on where we can expand shared services to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and get us on our way to meeting our debt to gross domestic product (GDP) target,” Mr. Holness said.He noted that the Government is committing to providing the private sector with the strategic support, “so that it can absorb whatever jobs may be released from the public sector”.He assured workers employed under the Fund that opportunities for jobs will be created elsewhere in government or in the private sector.AdvertisementsJamaica Information ServiceNewsProject To Grow Fisheries SectorState Minister Highlights Significance Of National Quality PolicySavage Pen Road in St. Andrew to be closed for Paving WorksBiometric Data For NIDS Database Will Be EncryptedPublic Comments Invited On Beach Access And Management PolicyContactOffice:58a Half Way Tree Road, Kingston 10Jamaica, W.ITel:1 (876) 926-3590-41 (876) 926-3740-6Email: Send us your queryCopyright 2020 The Jamaica Information Service.
