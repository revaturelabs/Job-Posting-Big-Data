Find a Sheltered SpotBefore you start prepping your car for a new paint-job you need to find the right place to do this.You need somewhere where your car will be protected from the weather and other elements that could interfere.

If you want your car to look great, make sure you set aside specific time for this work.There are three key stages of delivering a high-quality paint job on your car.Sanding removes the old paint from your car.
