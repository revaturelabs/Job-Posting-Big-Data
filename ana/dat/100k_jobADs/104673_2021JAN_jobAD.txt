"Joven's New Life as a Filipino Virtual Assistant - Onlinejobs.ph BlogJobseekerHow it WorksEmployer - FAQ Jobseeker - FAQ Learn To OutsourcePricingReal Resultspost a jobsign uplog inJoven’s New Life as a Filipino Virtual AssistantSeptember 2, 2015 By Julia Jasmine Sta RomanaJoven is like most Filipinos; defined by family. He is first and foremost a husband and father to his growing family.What makes Joven different is that he’s able to provide well for his family without leaving the country or spending most of his time away from them.Joven works from home. His life is different than most dads.He has a full-time job working as a virtual assistant for an American client. He works on his own time and has a great salary. Since he works from home he’s the one who mainly takes care of his son; taking him to school and preparing his meals.His wife has a regular job as a mall employee, so Joven also does most of the household chores. But despite all that he has time to go out with his friends and play badminton 2-3 times a week. He earns enough to send his son to private school and have an upper middle class lifestyle.He gets to do all that and more, because of Onlinejobs.phThe Truth About Filipino EmployeesWe Filipinos consider family our top priority. Our world revolves around family, so it’s common for us to live with our parents even after we’re married, live close to our extended family, and consider our relatives as our best friends.But often times, providing for our family means being away from them. Most Filipinos consider getting a job abroad as hitting the jackpot. But in exchange we spend years away from our family. We miss birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, and other important life events just so the people we love are well provided for.Yes, the booming BPO industry does provide an alternative. But in a way, it still detaches us from our families. We’re asleep when we’re most needed. We’re only there for them on the weekend or on our days off. And in time, the regular work shift takes a toll on our health.This is actually a common phenomenon with Filipino call center workers. Philippines BPO companies have a turnover rate of 20% (as of 2015), one of the highest in Asia. And a significant percentage of those who leave the BPO industry cite health problems like hypertension and diabetes brought about by fatigue and an unhealthy lifestyle.Yes, we can find regular jobs, but at what cost? The 2 hour commutes to and from work wastes our time. While the cost of fare, food, and clothes takes up a huge chunk of our small salaries.Working Less, Working Better, Getting Paid MoreWith his American client, Joven actually found himself working less but still earning more. He only works 5 days a week and on his own time. Joven would do a wide variety of tasks for his client (SEO, writing, marketing) and as long as he delivered on time, his employer paid him well.He saves money because he doesn’t have to spend for fare, food or clothes to work.He saves time because he doesn’t have to commute.He’s not stressed because he has a steady paycheck and regular schedule.He’s able to care and spend time for his family because he’s RIGHT THERE, whenever they need him.In short, Joven is living the dream life, thanks to online jobs.There’s a growing number of Filipinos who now have stories like Joven’s. Filipinos who couldn’t find regular work because of health or family issues; Filipinos who want something different from what society expects from workers, Filipinos who believe that it’s possible to have a great home life and career at the same time without sacrificing either one.Thanks to outsourcing, we have Joven, a husband, father, and happy Filipino online worker.You too can have a home-based job and a lifestyle like Joven.

So any updates regarding the jobs should be directed to them.ID Proof is about providing lots of information to help determine your identity. If you only provide a small amount of honest information, then you’ll have a low ID trust score.Make sure that you have everything filled out…..facebook url, government id, picture, skill descriptions, etc. The more information that you provide, the easier it is for an employer to determine that you are who you say you are. Your ID proof score will be higher too.After updating your profile, the ID Proof score does not get updated right away, but will be automatically rechecked by the site in a day or so.ReplyPrince Mutia says	September 10, 2017 at 11:36 amHi, I want a part time jobs, but isn’t to easy it’s to hard to find job.

I tried to search for a job and there’s a notice that I don’t have enough ID proof for that job. What will I do? Don’t know how to have ID proof. Hope you help me with this. Thank you.ReplyJulia Jasmine Sta Romana says	January 14, 2019 at 6:47 amID Proof is about providing lots of information to help determine your identity. If you only provide a small amount of honest information, then you’ll have a low ID trust score.Make sure that you have everything filled out…..facebook url, government id, picture, skill descriptions, etc. The more information that you provide, the easier it is for an employer to determine that you are who you say you are. Your ID proof score will be higher too.After updating your profile, the ID Proof score does not get updated right away, but will be automatically rechecked by the site in a day or so.ReplyMari says	August 28, 2019 at 12:15 pmI inspire Mr.Joven’s story like him I want to become also an Virtual assistant but for now I trying my best to deal with this kind of job, I am willing to learn and be a part of virtual assistant team.ReplyMariegold Arias says	October 19, 2019 at 3:44 pmI applied for 2 months already but no ones hire me!!

There are so many scams and phonies that litter the web that it has become near impossible to find real, honest opportunities. I gave OnlineJobs a shot anyway and found 3 employers that fit my schedule perfectly. Today, I make up to $280 USD a week and make more than just a living. Some people would have to wait years before they see the same salary. What’s more, it’s all done from the comfort of my home. No need to elbow my way through throngs of people or struggle with the physical demands of working a 9 to 5. Now, I’m on the verge of creating my own online service and I’m hoping to turn the tables with me at the employers end.

Luckily, I am experiencing that. Thanks to onlinejobs.ph! I’ve been working as IT helpdesk in an insurance company before I gave birth to my son and since I really wanted to be a mom and to take care of my son, I RESIGNED without any hesitation however few months after that reality hits me that it is hard when only one in the family is working but still I am decided that I will witness ALL my son’s milestone and be with him everyday, so I started to look for typing jobs over the internet and got disappointed because most of them needs to pay. Still God has it own timing, a friend of mine is working online as a telemarketer and referred me to be one of their agent and luckily the boss trained me and I learned a lot skills and knowledge in that area and as they say the rest is in history, now I am working multiple jobs and most of them I found is here in onlinejobs.ph so THANK YOU for being a way to where I am right now and what I have right now in my life..ReplyJulia Jasmine Sta Romana says	March 20, 2017 at 10:35 amThat’s awesome Crachiel!

If I have given a chance to work at home based online jobs I am willing to resigned in my job so I can witness all my kids milestone and be with them everyday. I am hoping for your quick reply on this matter.ReplyJulia Jasmine Sta Romana says	April 4, 2017 at 10:23 amID Proof is about providing lots of information to help determine your identity. If you only provide a small amount of honest information, then you’ll have a low ID trust score.Make sure that you have everything filled out…..facebook url, government id, picture, skill descriptions, etc. The more information that you provide, the easier it is for an employer to determine that you are who you say you are.

I want to link my main account now but i don’t see any option on how to do it. I believe that is causing me to have a low ID proof because i have less information on my second account. I will be grateful for any help you can provide.ReplyJulia Jasmine Sta Romana says	April 17, 2017 at 3:06 amHi Ques,Yes, you can change your Facebook account. Just email our customer support (support@onlinejobs.ph) and inform them that you want to change your FB URL. Don’t forget to include your jobseeker URL and the new FB profile you want to be attached to your account. They can make the changes for you.Replykemuel Jay says	May 5, 2017 at 9:40 amHi there!

The salaries posted by these employers are for mendicants, and would only attract entry level talents, however they require intermediate to expert level of knowledge! I know a lot of you employers want to save up by outsourcing here in PH. But please! Do not be a low baller. We have to pay for our rent, computer maintenance, internet bills, electricity and such. In the states the hourly rate can be from 8 USD to 12 USD per hour for entry level positions. Stop giving offers for as low as 2 USD per hour. 3 USD per hour is the ideal lowest rate you could offer for starters.If you want to attract a reliable VA that does not experience power outage nor internet outage, then consider providing better benefits and rates. Just a little more of low balling, it is like asking for your VAs to work for you for free. Not cool!ReplyKimPao says	May 27, 2017 at 8:11 amHi, 5 months ago I resigned my job as Autocad Engineer/ Instructor due to travelling issues Bulacan to Makati… I am currently managing my own Internet Cafe aswell as part time CAD Tutor.. The biz was good but still not enough to save money and for upgrading of PCs. We are experiencing a bit of problem right now due to Students’ vacation. Because of this I am seeking opportunity as a freelancer. I believe my designer skills could be a great asset , I am also a jack of all trades and could do admin works..also I have a quite nice PC Specs and internet connection and ofcourse a lot of vacant time.

I was very nervous about using the Online.Ph service. I had a crazy idea of starting an online business but had a few things going against me. No time to do any research on what potential businesses to get into. No experience. Very little available funds and, as a single working Father, the amount of energy was limited.Online.ph allowed me to avoid the situation of being forced into either paying the higher rates from other large freelancing sites (you will all likely know the sites I mean) which I simply could not afford or have to do it all myself, which would not be getting done.I hoped that this would provide workable and practical solutions for me.It was not all smooth sailing. I had 3 bad experiences here. Then finally I found the person who is my virtual assistant. I am so very pleased she is working for me. I will tell you that the bad experiences were well worth it to have had the chance to work for her.Whilst I cannot pay a lot of money, I do provide prompt payments, keep her apprised of all development, am extremely friendly, extremely flexible and understanding and work within sensible time restraints. I also seek her opinions and counsel.The result is that since March, we are nearly ready and have done nearly all the groundwork to start the business operations. I literally could not have done this without her. Even if I could have done her job as well as her, I would not have had the extra 8 hours a day to do it. She is a marvel.I am keenly aware that any success this business has will be influenced strongly by the foundations she tirelessly put in place. I believe strongly in sharing the rewards of success and will certainly look after her interests too. As this business grows and flourishes as will her role and salary within it.I am very pleased that I found this place.ReplyJulia Jasmine Sta Romana says	July 13, 2017 at 4:43 amCongratulations on finding that rockstar VA Ross!

I hope I get to work like Joven, too. Looking forward to dealing with youReplyShela heramis says	August 17, 2017 at 1:35 amI will always love oninelinejobs.ph I just wanted to share my story. I published this on my Facebook Page and I gave my story to my client as well (she really liked it). I believe that I am one of those desperate people who do not have a job and in a very helpless situation and onlinejobs.ph is like an angel that helped me through the hard times.It was March 2015, my health, my relationships, my work, and myself are all messed up. I had no choice but to give up my job as a Technical Support for Google. It was the company I’ve loved so much but I left it. I’ve been sick and in pain, I had a lot of Erythema Nodosum on both of my feet. It is like I have lot of swollen bruises on my sole so I couldn’t walk. I needed to stay at home. It was a depressing moment. But God is Good, my family and my loved ones were there for me.I literally started from nothing. I got no money to buy a laptop and our house doesn’t have internet connection. With the help of my sister’s credit card, I bought a laptop. I told her that I will get a job and pay her in installment. Then, I’ve camped on my best friend’s house so that I have internet connection. I’ve went on several freelancing websites, so set up my online profile on each of them, sent several applications and had a lot of interviews. But it is onlinejobs.ph that really helped me a lot. I finally got my first home-based job, an email support.The first salary I got, I spent it to set up the internet connection in our house and pay for the first month of my laptop’s bill. I’ve given 100% of my focus and I got promoted in just few weeks and had a full time job. I’ve became a manager of a Social Media Marketing Company. I’ve learned a lot of things during that time and enjoyed the freedom and comfort of working at home.Getting a good paying job is really nice. I was able to buy appliances and furniture and a lot more. But it was not that really easy, though I’m working at home and earning a lot, it’s not making me feel happy and accomplished. I need to follow the schedule of the COO and the tasks requires a lot of time (usually at night). It even get to a point that my body suffered again because I overworked and I’ve got Spinal Hemangioma. I guess my weak body has its own way of saying when I should stop doing things that are not making me happy.So now, I am freelancing. This is a better option for me because I can manage my own time. I want to pursue my passion. I want to fully know God and dedicate my life in loving God and loving people the best I could. All the physical pain I’ve endured thought me how it feels like to die, maybe that’s the reason why I value my time so much that I want to spend every second of it the way I want it.It’s been two years now since my heart and my life was broken. I’ve recovered. My best friend, who is now my fiance, and I are planning to be together for life and I am happy and I am pursuing my passion while working at home. I am a volunteer in Kid’s Church at Victory Fort and I’ve been freelancing. I’m a content writer, social media marketing specialist and a blogger. I manage my own time and I feel more alive.Here’s the video I created for my clienthttps://www.facebook.com/thefreed0mgeek/videos/vb.1059378890812707/1372624819488111/?type=2&theaterhttps://www.facebook.com/workathomegeek/ – This is my pageReplymailyn capangpangan says	August 22, 2017 at 3:26 amI inspire what joven story and i wish i could make that too.

Without receiving my salary for almost 4 months, I decided to return to Philippines and bought my own plane ticket (Fortunately, even I’m already in the Philippines they gave my salaries and benefits after sometime).I applied in several local and online jobs while waiting for another opportunity working abroad. The funny thing is if your a former OFW applying for local jobs, they will not hire you because your not qualified or you do not have experience, they will not hire you because you might leave the company when you find another work abroad or when you find a company with better salary offer.I also applied for other online job sites and call centers, Although I understand English, I’m not on an expert level and my typing speed is consider average. However, I love doing spreadsheets, making inventory templates and I can easily learn new things by watching videos or doing research.I have a family with two (2) kids and supporting them is my priority. As I mentioned, I applied on several online jobsites but onlinejobs.ph have the most reply from the employers. At first, I was disappointed because most of the posting requires experience on VA positions which I don’t have. I focused on applying for freelance MS Excel/spreadsheet jobs and landed few but after the project completion, I was again looking for work. However, I didn’t gave up, I look for any job posting with training provided by employer. Now, I am working as a Products Researcher for Amazon (sometimes Ebay) for almost a year now, enjoying hourly rate + commission. I am still doing some doing some freelance spreadsheet work. I was also offered to return to my previous employer in Saudi Arabia but I turned it down. Onlinejobs.ph made it possible for me to be with my family while providing for them.Thank you.ReplyJulia Jasmine Sta Romana says	November 9, 2017 at 7:00 amThat’s great Jay!

It’s more than a day already and I am losing hope. I wish you can help me out. thank you so mcuh.ReplyJulia Jasmine Sta Romana says	December 13, 2018 at 6:16 amHi John,It’s only been a day. Don’t lose hope. Like any job, it will take some time employers to process your application, schedule an interview, etc. It never takes just 1 day.ReplyRaden says	December 13, 2018 at 6:21 amI sent our more than 60 applications and attended almost a dozen of interviews before securing a job so yeah, I think you need to quadruple your effort. Applying for a home-based job is more challenging than applying to a BPO but if you are persuasive, you’ll get what you want. The reason why people fail is lack of hard work and perseverance. I am managing a team of 12 VA and every one of us has different stories and hardships during application is one of these stories. Don’t let this hardship discourage you.ReplyRaden says	December 13, 2018 at 6:24 amI say send at least six applications a day for 1 month. That’s how you secure a job. A day would lead you to nowhere. Sending at least six applications a day would not take 1 hour. Send only to positions you think you are capable of doing so.ReplyRandy Guhilde says	March 17, 2018 at 6:40 amThanks for having a chance to read such a nice inspiring store of a working dad at home.

If you only provide a small amount of honest information, then you’ll have a low ID trust score.Make sure that you have everything filled out…..facebook url, government id, picture, skill descriptions, etc. The more information that you provide, the easier it is for an employer to determine that you are who you say you are. Your ID proof score will be higher too.After updating your profile, the ID Proof score does not get updated right away, but will be automatically rechecked by the site in a day or so.ReplyLE says	June 29, 2018 at 7:51 amHi.

Glad we’ve been able to help!ReplyJudith Rafada says	December 14, 2018 at 2:45 pmI think all Filipino VA’s have the same sentiment. We all do this for our loved ones. We seek for a good paying job that will not require us to leave our family behind. I am a mother of three girls and my husband is in his 4th year of college (civil engineer). So grateful for the blessing of being able to assist my husband so he can focus on his studies and being present every time my girls need me. I think parent’s presence is very crucial nowadays. Many Filipino homes have been ruined because of the absence of a parent sometimes both parents, too busy to provide temporal needs while sacrificing the most important thing which nourishing the kids with love and attention. Love doesn’t really spell L-O-V-E but T-I-M-E and I am so blessed to have that now.I am grateful and pray that many Filipinos will have the confidence to try this opportunity as well.ReplyVic says	January 8, 2019 at 2:05 pmYou sure got it right!ReplyChast says	December 18, 2018 at 7:58 pmHi.

Actually I’m living for almost 11 years now in the Philipinnes and I’m a European national/citizin. Does that means it’s no use for me to sign in as a jobseeker.ReplyJessica Marie says	September 14, 2020 at 4:59 amHi Clay,Thank you for your comment.
