There may be a few bad apples but for your average Canadian, politeness and equality is the order of the day. Some of the most popular occupations for Americans in Canada are in administration because of the similarity in how business is done, and that there is no potential language barrier which may occur with immigrants from countries where English is not the first language. The top business administration jobs in Canada for US immigrants are wide and varied, but plentiful. It only takes one visit to Indeed or Randstad to find numerous positions all over the country.If you come on up here and you love it, the good news is that you can become a permanent resident. You will just need to apply to an immigration program that suits your situation. This can be trickier than you think when you take into consideration that there are over 100 different Canadian visa and immigration programs at your disposal, but we will get to that. If you want to start your immigration application today, start by following the link below.Start Your JourneyAdministration Jobs for US Immigrants in CanadaFrom British Columbia to Nova Scotia, there are great administration jobs up for grabs. Let’s take a look at some of the available positions in Canada, and how much workers are paid in those positions.Top Business Administration Jobs in CanadaOffice Administrator - $46,800 per annum Administrative Assistant - $45,000 per annumCustomer Service/Administration - $40,823 per annum Executive Assistant - $54,603 per annumBookkeeper - $52,000 per annum Business Administrator - $33,280 per annumPayroll Administrator - $50,822 per annum Systems Administrator - $76,660 per annumFinancial Administrator - $44,981 per annum Property Administrator - $46,321 per annumAdministrative Coordinator - $46,786 per annum Salesforce Administrator - $60,000 per annumIf you don’t see your profession on this list, don’t even sweat, this is just a sample of the more popular positions available across Canada. You will find a position that suits you. Now let’s consider what your immigration options are.How to Become a Permanent Resident of CanadaWe will consider three economic immigration programs through which US immigrants in Canada with or without job offers as administrators can become permanent residents and eventually citizens of Canada if they wish. Right now, permanent residency is the main goal as it allows you to access social benefits and makes you a formal part of our society.Express Entry SystemCanada’s premier economic migration vehicle is the Express Entry System. Made up of three programs based on an applicants skills and expertise, the system works by candidates creating online profiles and entering their relevant information such as work experience, qualifications, language abilities and so on. As an administrator with a post secondary qualification, you may be eligible for the Federal Skilled Worker Program. Using the information you provide, a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score will be calculated and you will be entered into the Federal Skilled Worker Programs pool of candidates. Twice a month draws are held and the candidates with the highest CRS scores in their pool are invited to apply (ITA) for permanent residency. Maximizing your CRS score is the key to receiving and ITA, and our professional consultants know just how to do it.Another option under Express Entry is the Canada Experience Class Program (CEC). If you were to work in Canada for a year, under a valid work permit of course, or already have a year over experience working in Canada as an administrator, you can apply to this program, who’s applicants receive preference in the draws over the Federal Skilled Worker Program.Provincial Nominee ProgramEvery Canadian province, besides Quebec and Nunavut, has its own Provincial Nomination Program (PNP). The programs are operated by the provincial governments and US immigrants can apply through the PNP for permanent residency in Canada. Every province has at least two streams for professional workers. One is connected to the Express Entry System, and if you are successful at securing a provincial nomination, you will create an Express Entry profile and your nomination will be added to your score. A provincial nomination is worth a whopping 600 points out of the total 1,200, so you are guaranteed an ITA as long as you meet the eligibility criteria. The second stream is an in-demand labour stream, which is aimed at particular labour shortages within the provinces, and you guessed it, administrators are on most of them.If you know which province you would like to live and work in, it would be wise to investigate the particular immigration streams available so that you can apply for a provincial nomination and become a permanent resident of Canada as soon as possible.Atlantic Immigration PilotIt’s all in the name; if you graduate from a university, maybe with a masters in administration, or secure a job offer in New Brunswick, Newfoundland & Labrador, Prince Edward Island or Nova Scotia and you could be eligible for permanent residency. These beautiful provinces are looking to attract more immigrants to the region by making the process a lot easier for foreigners. All you require is a job offer and you can apply to become a permanent resident of Canada as a foreign graduate, skilled or semi-skilled worker. Employers in the Atlantic region do not require Labour Market Impact Assessments (LMIA’s) to hire foreign workers, which makes it all a lot easier for everyone.How We Can Help You Immigrate to CanadaYou know just how confusing and complex the US’s immigration policies and programs can be, Canada is no different. We want foreigners to immigrate to Canada, we welcome them, for the skills they bring and the kind of life they come here to live, but we want them to do it the right way.
