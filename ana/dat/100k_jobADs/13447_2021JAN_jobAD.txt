Some seek out side jobs in fields that they aspire to work in after they retire from main occupations. Still others turn hobbies into lucrative side gigs. Whatever the reason, there are many second jobs available for people who want extra income.RetailThe most popular and sometimes easiest side job is to work in a retail store. High school and college students have been doing it for years. Many stores hire extra help during the Christmas season, making retail jobs the perfect way to earn some holiday cash. Many retail stores offer weekend or evening hours to make these jobs accessible for those with day jobs. The pay is usually low, but the work is not typically very taxing.Sitter DutiesBeing a sitter doesn’t necessarily just mean watching children, as you can include pets in your services as well. More than ever, people are paying for dog walkers and pet sitters. If you're allergic to pets, you can always stick to kids. Watching children can be especially lucrative during the holidays when parents like to attend holiday parties and need a sitter. Websites like SitterCity, allow you to post a profile in order to find clients.Lawn ServiceIf you have a lawn mower and are in reasonably good shape, a part-time job mowing lawns is a good way to supplement income. This is particularly lucrative if you live in a warm Southern climate. If you live in a Northern state, you can morph your business into a snow removal occupation during the winter. Mowing lawns works best if you have time during the week, since most homeowners like to enjoy their yards over the weekend.BloggingBlogging is not the most lucrative side job, but it's one of the easiest. Finding an interesting topic to blog about and creating a following is the hardest part. Once you've established a blog, you can earn money from it by finding advertisers for your site. Money is earned when visitors to your blog click on the ads. It's highly recommended that the ads tie in with the subject of your blog. At first the amount earned is negligible; however, over time, blogging can be a great source of passive income. The key is to blog frequently and learn how to position it so your search engine is friendly.Direct SellingAvon, Mary Kay, Amway and other direct sell brands have long been the go-to side jobs for women. This is because there's not a huge time commitment involved and the job usually involves hosting a party. If you're very outgoing and have a large network of potential clients, this can be fairly lucrative. The real money with these types of products comes when you bring in other people to sell the product for you and you receive a commission of their sales.House CleaningIf making things shiny and clean appeals to you, you may want to print up fliers and business cards and go to work. Many working families and singles alike no longer have the time to keep up with daily housecleaning and turn to cleaning services to pick up the slack. Start out small and build a following based on referrals. After a while, you may look into becoming bonded, which makes you even more appealing to potential clients. Don’t forget to market yourself to small businesses that are always on the lookout for office cleaners. If marketing yourself sounds like too much work, try joining an already established cleaning company as a part-time worker.Customer ServiceCompanies hire workers to answer customer service calls from their home. This is perfect for busy working moms who can't work outside the home in the evening. The hours are flexible; however, a computer and land-based phone are required.Freelance WritingYou can turn your writing skills into cash by writing for online magazines or websites. There are also local newspapers and community magazines that are always looking for writers. Sites like Hub Pages and Examiner hire new writers and pay per view.BartendingYou have to take a bartending class, but once you graduate, this may be one of the most lucrative side jobs out there. Bartending involves long hours, so you may want to limit yourself to weekend shifts if you work during the week. Not only is the pay good, but you receive tips as well. Be prepared to spend a lot of hours on your feet.Teaching and TutoringPossessing an advanced degree could help you get a job as an adjunct teacher at a local community college or even an online university. Most adjuncts teach one or two classes a semester. The pay isn't great, but is better than other side jobs with the same time commitment. If you don't have the credentials to teach at the university level, you can always put your love of math and science to work as a tutor. Put up flyers in local coffee shops or ask if you can post in school offices.ReferencesYahoo Finance: Top-Paying Part-Time JobsResourcesThe Wisdom Journal: 26 Ways to Make Extra Money While Keeping Your Day JobWriter BioAdele Burney started her writing career in 2009 when she was a featured writer in \"Membership Matters,\" the magazine for Junior League.
