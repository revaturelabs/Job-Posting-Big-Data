"Busy week or so – gizzajobblogSkip to contentgizzajobblogFinding work where it's easier to find a needle in a haystack!Busy week or soPosted on July 18, 2016 by gizzajob	I’m currently holding fort at gran’s as my brother has to get up in a few hours time for work; I’ve been up all night like a martyr but am gonna get some money from my brother in the end. 🙂 I have been kept occupied by emailing friends and typing up sonnets I had written over the past month or so, plus an attempt at a song I also wrote. So I can have a bona fide type up of my work. Remember the difference between, “Let’s eat, grandma!” and “Let’s eat grandma!” Correct grammar saves lives, even though I’m the King of typos. :pNo nausea this time, last week I purged due to feeling queasy, but this time I brought ginger mints and a newspaper to sit on to avoid nausea. Just another few hours to go. *Impatient*Share this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...RelatedTagged Caregivers, Clint Boon Experience, Inspiral Carpets, Ireland, Madchester, Mercury Rev, Northern Ireland, Supergrass, Unemployment, United Kingdom, Welfare ReformLeave a comment	Post navigation← Another week of challengesBlessing the Sturridge Dance (Sonnet) →Leave a Reply Cancel replyEnter your comment here...Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Email (required) (Address never made public)Name (required)WebsiteYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
