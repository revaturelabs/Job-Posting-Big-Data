paper it is.and dance it is. we dance when we dont want to all the time. 8th grade dance. prom. weddings when youre a kid. night clubs. of all the times ive danced id say only a few of the times i really wanted to. the end of the 8th grade dance (i was the dj), a few of my friends’ weddings, a handful of concerts, the kitchen with amber, vegas with amber, waiting for tacos with amber.when i worked at mcdonalds this kid broke down the large cups cardboard boxes and laid them out in the parking lot. he started breakdancing. i think about that a lot. i should have learned from him.commentsTweetposted on March 11, 2019 at 1:40 am | permalinkTags: dancing, unemployedPreviousNextearlier postsi slept all day because i was up all nightSaturday, March 9th, 2019 at 3:22 amwell today turned out being the dayThursday, March 7th, 2019 at 11:23 pmtoday is my last day with The AcademyThursday, March 7th, 2019 at 5:08 pmwalked in the rainWednesday, March 6th, 2019 at 7:02 ambutterflies on the windowsillTuesday, March 5th, 2019 at 1:18 pmfriends of the busblogtonypierce.com + busblogan xbi productionbloggers who still have blogsraspberryRick C.sugar conspiracyChris C.danielleZuliekaDuaneMeredithtoddkeirAndrearecently from the commentariatA Riedel on on april 23, 1992 soundgarden played Rob Gym at UCSBLisa Whitman on my man greg sent me this old Lick flierRalphy999 on my man greg sent me this old Lick flierRalphy999 on theres two techniques to getting a fare on lyftIan Locations on you’ll never feel at home in LA unless you keep movingghosts of busblogs past—2021 (15)January (15)+2020 (202)December (24)November (9)October (14)September (18)August (23)July (18)June (14)May (17)April (15)March (15)February (16)January (19)+2019 (204)December (12)November (10)October (15)September (10)August (16)July (20)June (18)May (25)April (18)March (21)February (14)January (25)+2018 (236)December (22)November (31)October (20)September (17)August (21)July (16)June (15)May (19)April (21)March (17)February (19)January (18)+2017 (319)December (19)November (22)October (24)September (13)August (25)July (25)June (29)May (32)April (28)March (35)February (27)January (40)+2016 (480)December (32)November (38)October (41)September (35)August (41)July (44)June (36)May (39)April (30)March (49)February (42)January (53)+2015 (496)December (57)November (44)October (46)September (46)August (40)July (40)June (40)May (37)April (32)March (41)February (35)January (38)+2014 (586)December (42)November (42)October (48)September (33)August (46)July (61)June (59)May (42)April (45)March (62)February (49)January (57)+2013 (829)December (52)November (61)October (76)September (51)August (65)July (55)June (59)May (86)April (75)March (82)February (86)January (81)+2012 (953)December (80)November (99)October (94)September (71)August (97)July (91)June (78)May (90)April (65)March (72)February (53)January (63)+2011 (730)December (62)November (54)October (67)September (58)August (82)July (47)June (37)May (45)April (47)March (80)February (62)January (89)+2010 (800)December (63)November (65)October (56)September (47)August (58)July (63)June (65)May (62)April (84)March (86)February (65)January (86)+2009 (852)December (65)November (54)October (63)September (66)August (65)July (69)June (67)May (73)April (82)March (86)February (85)January (77)+2008 (924)December (80)November (90)October (72)September (84)August (63)July (79)June (72)May (105)April (72)March (78)February (74)January (55)+2007 (427)December (39)November (43)October (45)September (49)August (42)July (25)June (32)May (26)April (36)March (28)February (27)January (35)+2006 (631)December (39)November (34)October (41)September (43)August (41)July (60)June (67)May (61)April (63)March (64)February (53)January (65)+2005 (826)December (61)November (59)October (64)September (68)August (54)July (63)June (84)May (84)April (83)March (63)February (62)January (81)+2004 (942)December (81)November (90)October (102)September (84)August (78)July (86)June (61)May (64)April (77)March (66)February (69)January (84)+2003 (916)December (75)November (76)October (90)September (108)August (75)July (71)June (92)May (77)April (77)March (65)February (56)January (54)+2002 (824)December (70)November (74)October (116)September (74)August (91)July (84)June (93)May (67)April (46)March (36)February (39)January (34)+2001 (133)December (22)November (24)October (29)September (31)August (17)July (10)©2011 tonypierce + busblog. an incredibly lifelike design."
