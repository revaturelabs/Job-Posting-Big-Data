Photograph: Eric LukeAs controversial crisis-era government programmes go, few were as reviled as JobBridge, which closed to new entrants yesterday. The national internship scheme, introduced by Joan Burton in 2011, was designed to help jobseekers get job experience with internships, in the process earning an extra €52.50 a week on top of their social welfare entitlement.While it was a laudable idea, a predictable number of employers were all too keen to take advantage of the subsidised labour it offered. Minister for Social Protection Leo Varadkar commissioned an independent review of the scheme, which recommended it be shut down. Varadkar acknowledged it was “far from perfect”, but nevertheless claimed it had achieved its goals.The reports of exploitation were abundant, with the Department of Social Protection investigating 200 companies for abuse of the scheme, and it wasn’t confined to the private sector. (Last year, the Department of Justice even used JobBridge to hire lawyers.)Just three of 112 job scheme interns kept on by Kerry County CouncilBackgrounder: JobBridge controversial from the startJobBridge to close to new applicants from FridayOf the approximately 38,000 people who took part, 70 per cent felt they got quality work experience. However, only about half felt it helped them get a job, enhanced career goals or even kept them in the jobs market. It was a bridge to nowhere, for too many people.Ultimately, at a time of economic crisis, JobBridge further lowered the perceived value of work. For the interns, too many of the positions felt exploitative, stripping them of dignity. To be unemployed in a recession is one thing, to be taken advantage of is another.And for many employers, it lowered the floor in terms of wages. Once a job can be done for a pittance, it is very hard to shake the perception that a pittance is how much it’s worth. That erosion of the perceived value of work can be hard to unwind, even in a growing economy, and may end up being JobBridge’s most regrettable legacy.Topics:Leo VaradkarJoan BurtonJobBridgeRead MoreDepartment of Justice uses JobBridge to hire lawyerTeachers told to ignore JobBridge positionsThe generation entitled to everything but a paying jobSiptu calls for publication of critical JobBridge auditJobBridge scheme not widely abused, says ex-welfare ministerJobBridge scheme has ‘grown out of control’ – ImpactSubscribe.More from The Irish TimesHealth2:14 Covid-19: Nursing homes to be prioritised for vaccination for 10 days amid supply shortageOpinionThis Covid-19 lockdown must be the last - even if that means it lasts longerRugbyBusy time ahead as players in Ireland face new contract discussionsPoliticsTD calls for ‘serious scrutiny’ of Leave.EU group that relocated to WaterfordMore in SponsoredRathcoole Co Dublin is within city reach but has all the calm of the countryA triumph of science and innovationBettystown Co Meath is ideally situated for both Dublin and BelfastCork and Tralee institutes of technology build on decades of industry collaborationCommenting on The Irish Times has changed.
