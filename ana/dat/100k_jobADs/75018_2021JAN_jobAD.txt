From July 26-30, 2021 we are offering an Introductory and Advanced Short Course on ParFlow. The registration will be opened later this year.Copyright: Dr. Jessica KeuneObjectivesScientific OrganizersVenue & ProgramRegistrationFeesScholarshipsObjectivesParFlow (parflow.org) is a numerical model that simulates the hydrologic cycle from the bedrock to the top of the plant canopy. It integrates three-dimensional groundwater flow with overland flow and plant processes using physically-based equations to rigorously simulate fluxes of water and energy in complex real-world systems. ParFlow is a computationally advanced model that can run on laptops and supercomputers and has been used in hundreds of studies evaluating hydrologic processes from the hillslope to the continental scale. ParFlow is open source (github.com/parflow) promoting community of active users and developers interested in advancing computational hydrology and improving hydrologic understanding.Introduction to ParFlowThe trainee will learn about the basic theory of ParFlow, how to generate all necessary input information to construct basic ParFlow models, and perform simulations. In addition, post-processing and visualization of ParFlow results will be discussed.Advanced applicationsThe trainee is familiar with ParFlow and will learn about advanced input functionality that is required to construct large-scale, sophisticated models to simulate terrestrial systems from the subsurface to the land surface. Simulations will be performed and the results will be discussed and analyzed in the context of high-performance computing, parallel scaling and big data analytics.Scientific OrganizersStefan Kollet (Forschungszentrum Jülich)Laura Condon (The University of Arizona)Nick Engdahl (Washington State University)Reed Maxwell (Colorado School of Mines)For questions, please contact the Coordination OfficeVenue & ProgramThe ParFlow Summer School will be taking part at the University of Bonn, Institute of Geosciences, Meteorological Department, Auf dem Hügel 20, Bonn, Germany.
