Credit: Philadelphia Water.Creating a green economy—jobs and services rooted in environmental sustainability—isn’t just a nice side effect resulting from Green City, Clean Waters. Green jobs and their economic benefits were a driving force in Philadelphia Water’s decision to develop a green infrastructure solution to our stormwater management challenges.Helping to meet the demand for green jobs created by our 25-year green infrastructure plan is the Sustainable Business Network of Greater Philadelphia’s (SBN) Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) Partners group, an independent non-profit “network of industry professionals working to advance the local green stormwater infrastructure industry and innovation in the Greater Philadelphia region.”GSI Partners is currently accepting applications for a three-day course designed to provide training for professionals interested in learning about how to take care of the ever-growing stock of green stormwater infrastructure in Philadelphia.With over 1,100 green tools already in place to support Green City, Clean Waters, there’s a real demand for landscape contractors with the skills needed to perform crucial operations and maintenance tasks. That demand will grow considerably as our multi-billion dollar plan expands over the next two decades.This course will provide valuable training to help meet that demand. Here’s a description of the curriculum from GSI Partners:This three-day course is for landscape professionals seeking to strengthen or develop their service portfolio in operations and maintenance of public and private green stormwater infrastructure projects. The course features two classroom days and one field day, and will provide landscape contractors with an understanding of the importance of operations and maintenance (O+M) of vegetated stormwater management practices, as well as of the tasks involved. The course will cover 16 sections in total, including: Regulatory context for O+M; Identification and understanding of the components of SMP’s; Diagnosis of and response to performance and safety issues; Adaptive and prescriptive management activities.Space is limited, and the course will take place on three separate days (August 21, 28 and September 4) at the Navy Yard. The cost is $350 per person.GSI Partners’ Continuing Education Grants will be available to eligible GSI Partners and SBN members interested in taking the course.To sign up for the course and apply for a grant, please visit the GSI Partners site by clicking here.PowerCorpsPHL Gets a POTUS Shout-outJul 15, 2015posted inGreen JobsGSIGSI Maintenance ProgramPowerCorpsPHLJuan Matos of the PowerCorpsPHL GSI Maintenance Program with President Obama on July 14.We’re always talking about what a great relationship we have with PowerCorpsPHL, and we love to point out when the young Philadelphians who help maintain Green City, Clean Waters infrastructure enrich their lives and even turn the experience into jobs in the green industry.But here’s one benefit we never could have imagined: Meeting the President of the United States.That’s exactly what happened to Assistant Crew Leader Juan Matos of the PowerCorpsPHL GSI (Green Stormwater Infrastructure) Maintenance Program when President Obama visited the city for this week’s NAACP convention.Matos, a 23-year-old dad from North Philadelphia, is in his second term of service as an AmeriCorps member with PowerCorpsPHL and joined the program in September 2014.He didn’t find out that he was going to meet with Obama, who wanted to learn more about successful re-entry programs for those who have been incarcerated, until Sunday night.Apparently, the president was impressed with Matos' bio, which PowerCorps provided. For Matos, it all came as a pretty big shock.“It was, like, out of the blue,” says Matos. “I had no clue what he was going to say or what I was going to ask him.”During their Tuesday meeting at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, Matos says Obama put him at ease with a relaxed conversation.“We talked about what it was like for me after I got out and about my family, and how PowerCorps helped me out and gave me guidance and skills I didn’t have before,” says Matos.Still, he was in for another surprise during Obama’s speech: Matos, PowerCorps, and green jobs got a special mention.Watch a clip of his comments about the program and Matos here:Obama’s words, Matos says, really stood out.“I was impressed that he was really paying attention to what I said, because he brought up details of the things we talked about in his speech,” Matos reflected on Wednesday.In particular, Obama mentioned that Matos’ biggest motivation to succeed—his daughters, Kyleigh, 3, and Jaylianis, 5—was something he could relate to as a dad of two girls.Obama also talked about the value of the green jobs training that PowerCorps provides:\"[Juan] was given an opportunity to get trained on green jobs that are helping the environment, but also gave him a marketable skill,\" Obama told the audience.Matos agreed with the president, noting that he’s learned much through the program that will help him when he begins a job search.\"Before, I didn’t know what GSI even was,” says Matos. “Now, I work with a crew that does maintenance all over the city on bumpouts, rain gardens, tree trenches, all of that, making sure they work properly. I’ve gained a lot of skills; I got brotherhood, I got a mentor. PowerCorps is a great program for helping people.\"Today, Matos is confident that he can have a bright future. But before he learned how to work with green infrastructure, that future wasn't so clear.“If it wasn’t for PowerCorps, I could have been back out on the street. They helped with school, they kept me working. They gave me a real second chance.”To learn more about PowerCorpsPHL and how they help us maintain Green City, Clean Waters, vist their Service Partners page.PowerCorpsPHL + PWD = A Win-Win TeamMar 6, 2015posted inGreen JobsPowerCorpsPHLServiceWhat has 18 legs, eradicates garbage and debris, spreads good will wherever it goes and spends 900 hours fighting to protect our rivers?The PWD PowerCorpsPHLTeam!Philadelphia Water is proud to be a service partner for PowerCorpsPHL.
