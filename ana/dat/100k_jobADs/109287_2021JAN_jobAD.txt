Their expertise is usually different from that of the core business operations.Example:A graphics designer working for a graphics designing company.Example:A graphic designer in the marketing department of a hospital.Revenue generators usually get more and higher bonuses, higher salaries, and more frequent salary increments. The reason is quite simple: it is easier to quantify your value to the company in monetary terms when you participate in revenue generation.“Try to work for companies where your skills can generate revenue. We can't all generate revenue and that's perfectly fine.”Bonus Comparison by Seniority LevelTop management personnel and senior employees naturally exhibit higher bonus rates and frequencies than juniors. This is very predictable due to the inherent responsibilities of being higher in the hierarchy.
