who previously led the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries when he was in government - said it was time for new minister John McVeigh to declare how many jobs would be slashed.He released a missive from DAFF director-general Jack Noye that Mr Mulherin said went to the department's entire staff.The letter sent on Monday stated that a six-month restructure would begin the next day, ensuring \"frontline and support services\" even as savings were found.\"The restructuring of business areas will result in staff reductions,\" the letter read.The overall changes and savings would be confirmed during the budget process in September.A spokeswoman for Minister McVeigh confirmed the letter, saying \"the majority of savings\" would come from corporate and head office, including finance, project management, and HR amongst others.The department's goal was to double food and fibre production by 2040 while meeting budget targets.The number of jobs it would have to cut to reach that goal remained unclear.In July, Mr Mulherin flagged that up to 550 jobs would be torn from the department but Mr McVeigh said although there would be cuts, they would affect fisheries patrols or other frontline services.However, Mr McVeigh would not be drawn on the amount of cuts.Mr Mulherin said the minister knew how many were going but was forcing them to wait six weeks for the news.\"The majority of Agriculture Department jobs are in regional areas and slashing them will have huge impacts on regional service delivery and local communities.\"DAFF has four main regional offices in Toowoomba, Longreach, Rockhampton and Townsville plus another five in Brisbane.It has more than 150 offices of different sizes across regional Queensland.03department of agricultureRead MoreLogin to followtim mulherinRead MoreLogin to followdepartment of agriculture tim mulherinSubscriber ExclusivesPremium Content ‘We need to step up’: koala champion honouredEnvironment A wildlife warrior has received the top honour in the Tweed Shire’s Australia Day Awards.Premium Content Citizen of the Year asks new arrivals to ‘create community’News She invited new residents to “donate their time and some of their wealth to the causes that need it”.Premium Content Indigenous culture honoured in Australia Day ceremonyNews A smoking ceremony was incorporated into the day's proceedings in a first for one town.Premium Content Dual sports star takes out young sportsperson awardSport The award recognised the teen's determination in the sporting world.Premium Content ‘Forced to watch porn’: Private schoolgirl’s bullying hellCrime A teenager at an elite Queensland girls’ school considered suicide after she was allegedly tormented by other students, who alleged forced her to watch porn and told...Premium Content Former NRL player dies in Top End quad bike crashRugby League A 32-year-old former NRL player who settled in central Queensland after his professional career ended has been killed in a quad bike accident near Darwin.Just InTerror trip on infamous 'cocaine highway'Shock verdict on Australia Day date push4Damning sign Australia Day is quickly 'crumbling'Aussie billionaire’s swipe at Musk2Premium Content Trump’s bold new move amid impeachment1Boy, 8, falls headfirst onto beach rocksJust InDad charged with murder over death of babyPremium Content ABC slammed for talking over ‘Invasion Day’ silencePrestige market to be ‘very strong’ in 2021Premium Content Tweed’s top honours named in Australia Day AwardsTop StoriesPremium Content Disgusting reason you should think before you flushNews ‘Fatbergs’ and other blockages in Gold Coast and Tweed sewerage systems are costing ratepayers millions of dollars each year.Premium Content Prankster's lawyers shocked by new chargeCrime Willem Powerfish faces a new chargePremium Content Roadworks bring changed traffic conditions on highwayNews Motorists can expect lane closures and traffic controlPremium Content Lismore’s leading lights recognised at Australia Day AwardsNews Six of Lismore’s best have been named in the Australia Day Awards© The Tweed Newspaper Co Pty Ltd 2021.
