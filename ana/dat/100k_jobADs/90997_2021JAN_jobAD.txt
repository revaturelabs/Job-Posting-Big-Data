"Job's Children: From the Wilmington Morning StarJob's ChildrenTuesday, July 22, 2014From the Wilmington Morning StarThe Wilmington Morning Star(Wilmington, North Carolina)8 March 1882 • Page 1This clipping from the March 8, 1882 edition of The Wilmington Morning Star caught my attention for a number of reasons.First, it made mention of Stanly County, North Carolina, and the towns of Norwood and Albemarle within.Second, it made mention of J. F. Ramsey, who holds a place in my family tree, and who had passed away on my birthday.It was heartwarming to see the compliment toward the grains and soil of Stanly County, with it being \"the greatest grain producer of any land in the State\". Reason, no doubt, why not all of its citizens relocated to Arkansas, as the 1880's were a big decade for migration there.I was glad to have found the mention of J. F. Ramsey's decease, because in examining the family trees on Ancestry.com, no one had discovered the date of his demise and just noted that he had passed prior to the 1900 census.J. F. Ramsey was John Franklin Ramsey, son of Samuel Ramsey and Rebecca Helms, my fifth great-grandparents. His older sister, Obedience \"Beedy\" Ramsey, was my fourth great-grandmother of course. She married William Hill and they were the parents of William Mathew Hill. He married Sarah Jane Hooks and they became the parents of Lottie Hill.She married Harvey Lafayette Lemmons and they were the parents of Bertha Virginia Lemmons Lambert, my grandmother, who lived to meet my three oldest children.But back to her Uncle, John Franklin Ramsey.I've wanted to explore the Hooks, Ramsey's and Hills more in depth, and will soon. As far as the Ramsey line, I have become stuck with the parents of Samuel Ramsey, Stark and Lisha, who appear in the 1850 census. If anyone knows anything at all about this couple, or this family, I would certain enjoy the enlightenment.John Franklin Ramsey was born about 1836 to 1840. He was Samuel and Rebecca's next to the youngest son. The list of their children is as follows:1824 - 1865 William Riley Ramsey1829 - 1870 Rowena J Ramsey Whittington1825 - 1900 Obedience L. \"Beedy\" Ramsey Hill (later married sister's widower James Whittington1830 - 1924 Jane Louisa Ramsey Smith1834 - 1907 James Thomas Ramsey1837 - 1882 John Franklin Ramsey1837 - unknown Gilliam O Ramsey (perhaps shortly after Civil War)John Franklin \"Frank\" Ramsey first shows up still living with his parents in the 1850 census.Name:Franklin RamseyAge:14Birth Year:abt 1836Birthplace:North CarolinaHome in 1850:Smiths, Stanly, North CarolinaGender:MaleFamily Number:640Household Members:NameAgeSamuel Ramsey 53Rebecca Ramsey 53William Ramsey 23Jane Ramsey 17Thomas Ramsey 16Franklin Ramsey 14Gilliam Ramsey 13All of the known children are still at home, except older sister Rowena, who has already married James Whittington.Name:Roenna WhittendonAge:21Birth Year:abt 1829Birthplace:North CarolinaHome in 1850:Smiths, Stanly, North CarolinaGender:FemaleFamily Number:711Household Members:NameAgeJames Whittendon 23Roenna Whittendon 21They all live in the Smith's community of Stanly County, North Carolina, which I believe, but am not certain, was in the southwest section of the county.He may have moved to Rowan County for a brief time by 1860, and enlisted in the army in Salisbury in 1862.Name:John RamseyResidence:Stanly County, North CarolinaEnlistment Date:1 Feb 1862Enlistment Place:Rowan County, North CarolinaSide Served:ConfederacyState Served:North CarolinaService Record:Enlisted as a Sergeant on 1 February 1862 at the age of 24.Enlisted in Company C, 42nd Infantry Regiment North Carolina on 1 Feb 1862.Promoted to Full Private (Reduced to ranks) on 1 Jul 1862.Promoted to Full Sergeant (Estimated day and month of promo) on 15 Oct 1862.Sources:16All of the Ramsey sons enlisted and served in the army. Frank and Thomas returned. William, the oldest son, had a very unique story. He was injured and ill, sent to the hospital and eventually to the Insane Asylum in Raleigh, where he disappeared in the fall of 1864. He made it back home to his family, as youngest daughter Margaret was born in 1865. His family had relocated to Burke County, North Carolina by 1870, by which time he was deceased. It is not known if he found his family in Stanly County before relocating to the mountains, or whether they met him there.Youngest son Gilliam O Ramsey achieved the rank of 2nd Leut. and may have passed away prior to ever returning home, or died of disease or infection after his release from service.Name:Gilliam O RamseyResidence:Stanly County, North Carolina, North CarolinaAge at Enlistment:22Enlistment Date:29 Jul 1861Rank at enlistment:3rd LieutenantEnlistment Place:Stanly County, North CarolinaState Served:North CarolinaSurvived the War?:YesService Record:Commissioned an officer in Company D, North Carolina 28th Infantry Regiment on 29 Jul 1861.Promoted to Full 2nd Lieutenant on 12 Jul 1862.Mustered out on 28 Dec 1862.Birth Date:abt 1839Sources:North Carolina Troops 1861-65, A RosterOn November 22, 1868, J.

Living with Frank and Joicy at this time is Nancy Arrana Holt. She, like the other Holt children, were dispersed through the community after the deaths of their parents in the 1850's, some to relatives, others to families with no apparent relation. Nancy Arrana Holt was the sister of Alvina Holt Carter, the first wife of Balaam A. Carter.Balaam Carter and Alvina Holt CarterThe next year, on January 12, 1871, Nancy would marry John Riley Hinson. They would have 4 children together: 1873 Sophronia A. , 1875 Cora Bell, 1878 Ella J and 1880 Hattie Lee.Name:J. F.

Ramsey 6mBy 1880, all of Frank and Joyce Ann's children had been born: Ella Jane, Sarah Elizabeth aka \"Lizzie\", Willie Mae (a daughter) and only son, Samuel Lee Ramsey, named for his grandfather.In 1876, J F Ramsey was paid a small stipend for service to the county of Stanly.Land records involving J. Frank Ramsey include a transaction in 1868 between his brother J. T. (James Thomas) Ramsey to him, involving a tract of land containing 136 1/2 acres along the courses of Mill Branch. Neighbors mentioned by a line or a corner were: Elizabeth Lowder, John B. Simpson, Thomas Lowder, Stephen York and Wiley Hudson.Then in 1872, J F Ramsey and wife J. A. Ramsey \"hereby donate and give\" to J. T. Ramsey, the same property of 136 1/2 acres, from a stake in Mill Branch. Neighbors mentioned were: Elizabeth Lowder, John B. Simpson's now Thomas Lowders line, David Coley, Stephen York, Wiley Hinson.Backing up to January of 1869, J T and J F Ramsey sold to George Smith and wife, who was their sister Louisa Jane Ramsey Smith, their share of a tract of land belonging to the heirs of G. O. Ramsey. G. O. was their youngest brother, who served well in the Civil War. The tract was the same conveyed from James Thomas Ramsey to his younger brother, Gilliam O. Ramsey, ten years prior, in 1859. The deed was signed by J. T. Ramsey and wife Elizabeth and J. F. Ramsey and wife Joicy.In November of 1877, J. F. Ramsey signed a mortgage due Columbus Whitley for $9.50.Shortly thereafter, he mortgaged a buggy to Jesse C. Gilbert for $5.00.On July 16, 1880, he sold a lot of 3 1/2 acres to Davidson Mann that was on a line between his own property and Mann's that adjoined the David Holt line. Proximity to the Holts may have been the reason Nancy Arrana Holt had ended up with them in 1870.Joyce Ann Redwine Ramsey continued to appear in the land records following her husbands demise. About 1890, she appeared in a list of property owners along and through whose property, right of way was granted to the Yadkin railway. We know from the census, that she had removed to Salisbury by then.Then in 1903, she, along with her siblings and their spouses, sold their shares of property inherited from their parents to her sister and brother-in-law, Ann Eliza and Julius Coggins. The document is in Book 29, Page 100 and dated January 9, 1903 and lists as parties of the first part, Sarah R. Smith, widow of the County of Stanly, North Carolina; J. M. Coggins and wife M. A. Coggins (who is Myrick Adeline Coggins, who later signs her name 'Addie'.); J P Redwine and wife, R. A. Redwine and Joicy A Ramsey, widow of the County of Rowan, State of North Carolina and Julius Coggins and wife Anna Eliza Coggins of the county of Stanly, state of North Carolina, of the second part.And then came the mention from the Wilmington paper. In the growing and developing town of Albemarle, J F Ramsey, passed away. The paper stated he was 40, but he was probably closer to 43 to 45 years of age.His widow Joyce Ann \"Joicy\" Redwine Ramsey did not stay idle. She relocated with her children to the Salisbury/Spencer area of Rowan County, which with the growing railway industry was bustling with activity and even professions a lady could endeavor. As her brothers, JP and RA and sister Myrick Adeline Coggins, are all listed as being from Rowan in the 1903 land transaction, following the 1899 death of their father, it could have been the fact that family had settled in Rowan that led Joicy Ann to the neighboring county.Name:Mrs Joicy RamseyGender:FemaleResidence Year:1907Street address:728 s MainResidence Place:Salisbury; Spencer, North CarolinaPublication Title:Salisbury, North Carolina, City Directory, 1907The City Directories would find her living on South Main Street, which in Salisbury leads into Spencer.Her daughter Ella Jane would be listed for most years as a Weaver at Salisbury Mills, while her mother took in boarders.Name:Joy A RamseyGender:FemaleResidence Year:1928Street address:828 s MainResidence Place:Salisbury; Spencer, North CarolinaSpouse:Frank RamseyPublication Title:Salisbury, North Carolina, City Directory, 1928In 1900, Joicy was living in Salisbury along with daughters Ella and Lizzie and only son Sam. Also joining the family was newborn grandson, Charlie Ramsey, who would later become Charles Basil Surratt, after his mother married Pegram A. Surratt, a local businessman born in Jackson Hill, Davidson County, who migrated to Texas, and eventually settled back in Rowan County. All of Charlie's documents name P. A. Surratt as his father, whether adopted or biological is unknown.Name:Joicie Ramsay[Joieu A Ramsay]Age:53Birth Date:May 1847Birthplace:North CarolinaHome in 1900:Salisbury, Rowan, North CarolinaRace:WhiteGender:FemaleRelation to Head of House:HeadMarital Status:WidowedFather's Birthplace:North CarolinaMother's Birthplace:North CarolinaMother: number of living children:4Mother: How many children:4Occupation:View on ImageNeighbors:View others on pageHousehold Members:NameAgeJoicie Ramsay 53Ella J Ramsay 30Elizabeth S Ramsay 30Samuel S Ramsay 20Charlie Ramsay 3/12James P Redvine 48Maddie Redvine 11John Eddleman 30Adam Norton 31Dennis Myrick 18Also living with Joicy and her children are brother James P. Redwine and his ll year old daughter, Maddie. There are also 3 non-related boaders, young men who all worked in the Cotton Mill along with her 3 children: John Eddleman, Adam Norton, and Dennis Myrick.

Grandson Charlie Ramsey is now 10. Of note is that they live beside of Benjamin F. Rabon and his wife Hattie, who is Joicy's niece. The census also tells us that Joicy owns her own home outright, no mortage, on 3 acres and that she is considered blind by the age of 62.Daughter Willie Mae has already married a Smith and son Sam is out on his own. Later this year, Lizzie married P. A. Surratt. Ella never marries.Name:Joysia Ramsay[Joyce Ramsay][Joseph Ramsay]Age:72Birth Year:abt 1848Birthplace:North CarolinaHome in 1920:Salisbury, Rowan, North CarolinaRace:WhiteGender:FemaleRelation to Head of House:Mother-in-lawMarital Status:Widowed[Widow]Father's Birthplace:North CarolinaMother's Birthplace:North CarolinaNeighbors:View others on pageHousehold Members:NameAgePigram A Surratt 51Lizzie Surratt 48Joysia Ramsay 72Ella Ramsay 47Charlie Surratt 19Ida M Surratt 8William Lippard 24Claud Lippard 22John Eddleman 50Badge Ballard 33In the 1920 census, son-in-law Pegram A. Surratt has taken over the boarding house and is listed as a Merchant in a grocery store. Daughter Lizzie is a clerk in the same store. Joicy is too old to work and Ella is still a weaver in the Cotton Mill. Charlie, Lizzie's son, had now taken on the name \"Surratt\" and is working with his aunt in the Cotton Mill. Ida Mae, the only daughter of Pegram and Lizzie, has joined the family. She was born in Texas. Pegram may have met Lizzie on one of his many visits home, and married her, taking her back to Texas, where he was a Hog Farmer, for awhile. By 1920, however, the family had relocated back to North Carolina. Also in the home were 4 boarders, brothers William and Claud Lippard, who are listed as clerks in a dry goods store and John Eddleman and Badge Ballard, who worked in the Cotton Mill.Name:Joyce A RamsayGender:FemaleBirth Year:abt 1848Birthplace:North CarolinaRace:WhiteHome in 1930:Salisbury, Rowan, North CarolinaMap of Home:View MapMarital Status:WidowedRelation to Head of House:HeadFather's Birthplace:North CarolinaMother's Birthplace:North CarolinaOccupation:Education:Military service:Rent/home value:Age at first marriage:Parents' birthplace:View imageNeighbors:View others on pageHousehold Members:NameAgeJoyce A Ramsay 82Ella J Ramsay 61[51]Pegram A Sarratt 62Sarah E Sarratt 59Badge C Ballard 40John Eddleman 55The 1930 census was Joicy's last census and year. She is listed as head of the household, which suggests that son-in-law Pegram had moved into the same boarding house on South Main, that Joicy had been operating. Ella is now also retired and Pegram and Lizzie are still operation their store. Children Charlie are grownup now, with Ida having moved in with relatives in Davidson County, and Charlie married with 2 children of his own. Boarders John Eddleman and Badge Ballard are still in the home, Badge now a cobbler in a shoe shop and John still working in the mill.Soon after the 1930 census, Joyce Ann Redwine Ramsey aka \"Joicy\" passed away, on May 20th or 21st. She was buried in Salisbury at the Chestnut Hill Cemetery. It is unknown where her husband Frank was buried. None of the older members of the household made it to 1940. Daughter Ella Jane died in 1935, and was buried alongside her mother.Her death certificate lists her age as 82 years and 11 months and the cause of death a pulminary hemorrhage, with contributing factors related to age.Daughter Lizzie died in May of 1834, after which her husband, Pegram relocated his store to Elizabeth City, North Carolina, which did not last long, as he passed away in 1936, and was brought back to Salisbury to be buried with his wife at Chestnut Hill. His death certificate said that he passed away of M. S. and muscular atrophy, so he must have had difficulty running his business in his latter years.The passing of Joicy and her daughters was the end of an era in that Ramsey line. However, the story did not end there. My next post will be to look more in depth to the children and boarders of Joicy Ann Redwine Ramsey.I was glad to have found an obituary and therefore a date of death for \"Uncle Frank\". So many times, ancestors who passed away prior to death certificates, or whose tombstones were destroyed or lost are listed without a date of death. Now, for John Franklin Ramsey, we have one.Willie Mae Ramsey Smith and her daughter Nezzie Smith.Posted by Jobs Children at 11:44 AMEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels: Albemarle, Hill, John Franklin Ramsey, Joyce Ann Redwine, Pegram Surratt, Ramsey, Redwine, Salisbury, Texas, Wilmington9 comments:Unknown February 15, 2017 at 6:18 PMI'm stunned.
