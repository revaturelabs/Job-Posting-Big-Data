Also, the liquor server minimum wage will jump to $10.70 an hour, from $9.20, in the first of two steps to eliminate the rate differential altogether in 2016. The government also reiterated its commitment to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2018.We apologize, but this video has failed to load.Try refreshing your browser, ortap here to see other videos from our team.Calgary businesses warn minimum wage hike could lead to job losses Back to video“We’re fairly disappointed that the government of Alberta has decided to move so aggressively toward their target of $15 by 2018 especially at a time when there’s still economic uncertainty in Calgary and in Alberta,” said Justin Smith, director of policy, research and government relations with the Calgary Chamber of Commerce.“In our communication with member businesses we understand that in order to mitigate against the cost increase the likely response from some businesses will be staff reductions, a reduction in hours of work, and possibly some price increases as well.”AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedJobs Minister Lori Sigurdson said Monday that the government consulted dozens of stakeholders and reviewed written submissions regarding its plans to raise the minimum wage. The NDP government recently passed legislation to raise taxes on large corporations to 12 per cent from 10 per cent, effective July 1.Article content continued“The government is consulting with stakeholders but through such a short window I don’t think they’re getting the full picture of the impact,” said Amber Ruddy, senior policy analyst with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business in Calgary. “It’s being touted as balanced and reasonable but when you ask any small business owner the reaction is quite different.Article content continued“We’ve been surveying our members and they’re telling us it’s going to result in less hours for their current employees. It’s going to result in cutbacks to perks that they offer — free lunches, parking. And in some cases it will result in job losses because this will have a huge impact on their bottom line.”Gil McGowan, president of the Alberta Federation of Labour, said he was somewhat disappointed the government didn’t go farther.“At $11.20 an hour, our new minimum wage will be the highest among Canadian provinces but it still won’t be anything close to a living wage,” he said, adding the AFL was hoping for $12 an hour as a first step. “With this increase we will move from having an abysmally low minimum wage to having a merely insufficient wage. Is that progress? Sure. But is it enough? I don’t think so.”AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedBrian Lee, chief financial officer of the Concorde Entertainment Group, which operates 17 restaurant/bar establishments in Calgary totalling 1,300 employees, said the wage hike will have a “significant” impact.“Our concern is that these changes were arrived at with very little industry consultation,” he said, adding the move follows a liquor tax increase earlier this year.“When it’s done gradually as they say they’re going to do, it gives industry an opportunity to plan and adjust. But when you increase our wages for our front-line staff by $1.50 that’s not a gradual increase.”Restaurants Canada said removing the liquor server wage next year will hurt restaurants.“Higher labour costs will force employers to cut server hours and the time they have to earn more tips, “said Mark von Schellwitz, the organization’s vice-president for Western Canada. “For an industry that’s already struggling with intense cost pressures, razor-thin profit margins and a tough economy, this couldn’t come at a worse time.”Kari Green, a server with Hudsons Canadian Tap House on Whyte Avenue in Edmonton, said while a higher wage is welcomed, it could come with some consequences.“To increase wages for (businesses) means they’re going to have to increase menu prices and then do customers still come here frequently enough if our menu prices are going up?“And if the food items are too pricey, then I think tips will be affected more, too.”AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedAlida Visbach, president and CEO of Heritage Park, said the government announcement “comes as quite a shock.” A $15 minimum wage would raise overall wages there by 42 per cent, or $4.9 million, she said, even though fewer than two per cent of its 750 employees now earn the minimum.“As the minimum wage goes up, everything goes up and I can’t start charging 42 per cent higher at our gate for our food services, for our retail, then we would no longer be competitive and then that completely negates increasing the wage for minimum wage earners because they will then not be able to afford those prices,” said Visbach. “It’s just a snowball effect.“I’m all for a living wage and I’m all for people making a decent wage to survive on but there has to be a thoughtful way of doing this.”Lisa Costello, owner and chief executive of Neal’s Yard Remedies, an organic skin care store in Calgary, said businesses need to pay more than minimum wage to stay competitive while also providing an enticing place to work. The company has one store in the Mission district with seven employees and will be opening another store in Southcentre Mall later this year.“If minimum wage goes up, it puts more pressure on you to make sure that you’re an exciting place to work but it ultimately means you have to maintain the gap between the pay increase that you’re facing with your employees and the price you can recover from the market,” she said. “If minimum wage goes up, we have to find a new way to maintain that gap and find ways to find employees that are going to want to work for us at rates that we can afford.”mtoneguzzi@calgaryherald.comTwitter.com/MTone123Share this article in your social networkShare this Story: Calgary businesses warn minimum wage hike could lead to job lossesCopy LinkEmailFacebookTwitterRedditPinterestLinkedInTumblrCalgary Herald Headline NewsSign up to receive daily headline news from the Calgary Herald, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.Email AddressThere was an error, please provide a valid email address.By clicking on the sign up button you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.
