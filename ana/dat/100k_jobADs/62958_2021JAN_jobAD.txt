REVH is located in beautiful southern New Hampshire, minutes from Boston, mountains, or the seacoast.To accommodate our growth, last summer we completed a building expansion (adding extra storage, a specialty treatment room, conference room, doctor’s office, and an expanded radiology room), and we just completed a parking lot expansion that nearly doubled our parking capacity. Our hospital includes a full in-house laboratory, newly upgraded DR Xray, ultrasound, isolation ward, and a surgical suite fully equipped for all soft tissue surgery, including electrocautery and state-of-the-art patient monitoring equipment. We have a new Snyder ICU cage, and an OGSI oxygen generating system so we are not reliant on tanks and never run out of oxygen. Soon we will be adding portable digital Xray for exotics, and a Ligasure unit to improve surgical efficiency.Technicians are well-paid, highly-skilled, and properly utilized so that doctors are free to do doctor stuff. All staff members are appreciated and treated as such- we value all employees’ input and offer a collaborative environment.We have a zero tolerance policy for abusive clients, and always have our staffs' backs. Turnover is low, with some employees having been with us since we opened 11 years ago.Windham is an affluent but small town, and we have many repeat clients who are motivated and have the means to provide the best care for their pets. We have a great relationship with all local RDVMs, and we communicate closely with them regarding their patients. REVH is well known and respected in our small community, and in surrounding towns.Full-time ER doctors work a set schedule, averaging 3 shifts per week with large blocks of time off. We understand that ER shifts can be challenging and we do our best to make sure our doctors can maintain a good work-life balance while still enjoying the excitement of ER medicine!The ideal candidate has at least 1 year of experience or is internship trained and is comfortable with most emergency surgeries. Experience or comfort with exotics is a plus, as REVH also treats exotic pets. New graduates would be considered based on experience. Above all, the ideal candidate is a good communicator, a team player who gets along well with others, and doesn’t take themselves too seriously!Compensation includes:Generous base salary plus production bonusPTOAnnual CE allowancePaid professional memberships, licensure, PLIT and VINDEA license100% paid health insurancedental, FSA, and life insurance401K with matchSign-on bonus, and relocation allowance where applicable.Interested candidates please send resume and Letter of Intent to Denise Bly, practice manager.NOTES:Additional Salary Information: Sign on bonus and relocation assistanceCreate a Job Alert for Similar JobsAbout Rockingham Emergency Veterinary HospitalRockingham Emergency Veterinary Hospital is a 24/7 emergency-only hospital, treating small animals and exotics.Connections working at Rockingham Emergency Veterinary HospitalBACK TO TOPHelp is on the way!We're sorry you are having trouble applying for this job.Please try loading this job using the following link before submitting your help request:Name: Email:Please provide details:Submit Help RequestErrorCloseContinuePowered ByYou do not have JavaScript Enabled on this browser.
