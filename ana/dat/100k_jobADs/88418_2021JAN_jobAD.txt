For example, Electricians are responsible for wiring a building, and Construction Workers are responsible for everything that needs to be done to get each room ready for wiring. Construction Workers used to be referred to as “unskilled” labor, but the reality is that they're generalists who have a wide set of skills.Being a Construction Worker requires one to be good working with their hands. It also requires solid teamwork, as the number of workers on a given site can range between a handful and hundreds. The following are some typical Construction Worker responsibilities:Physical tasks, such as repeatedly lifting and transporting construction materialsHeavy equipment tasks, such as operating forklifts and other construction vehiclesCustodial tasks, such as sweeping a site upon completion of carpentry workRoadwork tasks, such as filling potholes and paving roadsConstruction Worker SkillsAs we mentioned before, it is a misconception that Construction Workers used to be referred to as “ unskilled laborers”. The reason this label came to be is simply because Construction Workers have no specific trade. They aren't Carpenters or Plumbers, yet they often possess similar skillsets to these tradesmen. In addition to the vast array of technical skills, Construction Workers also possess several soft skills required for success. Construction workers have to have excellent verbal communication skills, as good communication is integral to both the completion of the project and the safety of the workers. Construction Workers also have to be able to work in a fast-paced environment. Virtually all construction projects operate under a strict timeline and budget, so the work environment can get pretty hectic as deadline approaches.Some other key Construction Worker skills include:Proficiency with math and measurementsPhysical strength and staminaDecision-making skillsDetail-orientatedWorking knowledge of hand tools and power toolsHow Do You Become a Construction Worker?Education and TrainingOne plus side of becoming a Construction Worker is that one does not have to amass thousands of dollars of student loan debt earning a Bachelor's degree in order to get an entry-level position. Most entry level Construction Worker jobs only require a High School diploma or G.E.D. It is this low barrier for entry that has spawned the misconception of Construction Work being a “dead end job”. The reality is Construction Workers have several career development avenues available to them. There are several ways Construction Workers can earn to build their skills portfolio. Here are some examples.OSHA Outreach Training Program: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is the government agency responsible for maintaining safe work environments for employees. Given the hazardous nature of construction sites, virtually all employers require entry-level workers to have completed the OSHA Outreach Training Program for Construction Workers.The OSHA Outreach Training Program is a “ Construction Safety 101” survey class that teaches students how to work safely on construction sites. There are two versions of this certification: the 10-hour and 30-hour. The 10-hour is designed for entry-level workers, while the 30-hour is designed for those with supervisory responsibilities. Those looking to earn this certification can use OutreachTrainers.org to find certified trainers in their area.Apprenticeship: Most of a Construction Worker’s education comes through on-the-job training. Experienced workers take new hires under their wing and supervise their work for the first few weeks. While a version of this informal training exists on every construction site, there are formal apprenticeship programs one can complete. These programs are offered by either trade unions or contractor’s associations.An Apprentice program can last up to five years, although they typically range from two to four years long. The program is a blend of classroom instruction and on-the-job training. Roughly 20% of an apprenticeship is spent in classroom, while the other 80% is spent on-site putting what was learned in the classroom into action. The exact number can vary from program to program, but most require around 400 classroom hours and 4000 supervised work hours in order to progress from Apprentice to Journeyman.The initial 200 hours focuses on the basics of the construction field. Most content is focused on correct use of tools and how to read blueprints, as well as health and safety standards. The remaining classroom hours will depend upon your chosen specialization. Construction Workers can specialize in three main areas:Environmental RemediationBuilding ConstructionHeavy and Highway ConstructionAs a Construction Worker progresses through his or her career, the opportunity will arise to earn specialized certifications. The certification one pursues depends upon their desired specialization. For example, those who have a preference for driving forklifts have to earn a heavy equipment certification. Those who prefer to work in hazardous waste removal would have to earn a federal hazardous waste removal license.Finding a JobNo matter how many industries come and go, the Construction industry will always be in demand. According to the National Bureau of Labor Statistics, demand for Construction Workers is predicted to rise 13% through 2024.
