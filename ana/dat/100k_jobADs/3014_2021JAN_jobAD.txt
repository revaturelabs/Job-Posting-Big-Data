I dont know abt the Ajax but even I am the student of HR House. Infact our batch was the first batch when it was started in koramangala. They are functioning both Koramangala as well as Rajaji Nagar. In HR House they are training the same which U learnt in MBA of All the core HR modules. but here they are quite deep in calculations & Formalities of PF, ESI, PT & Gratuity. You can learn those even from CITE HR from various quiries. Even in HR house they teach only outline of those stuff but cant go into depth.HR House people try to convince you telling as they have good recognition & Name in the industry & they will tell as you will be given priority for selection process. But practically it is not happening at all.Even payroll is also one of the important role in HR so be thorough in payroll too.I feel you can get into recruiter for time being. But I don't think as it will add much experience in HR generalist or other HR functions.I can guide you on payroll into much depth for any queries.Remaining is left to you.CheerzJeeva93437533612nd September 2009 From India, Bangalorenetra.sap3thanx alot....actually i was planning to join...but now i wudn't.I want to work in admin and employee relations development side how to start up,is it necessary that u need to work as a recruiter at the begining.....and yeah i wud be thankfull if u can guide me on payroll.3rd September 2009 From India, Bangalorejeevarathnam4Hi Netra!Generally the admin, ER & Recruitment is entirely different roles. that too there is no relationship between admin & Recruitment. But slightly there are some significances between recruitment and ER. I don,t think so as you want to join as recruiter for these profiles. If you gain experience in recruitment it majorly helps for Recruiter and general HR profiles.Wait & watch for the openings for Admin exec positions. If there are any of frnds working as admin then just discuss with them what are the roles has to be played.Actually there are huge roles of Admin person. those cannot be explained in words by mail. It is vast.CheerzJeeva4th September 2009 From India, Bangalorenetra.sap5Hi Jeeva,tomarrow i've a written test for a company...for the post of Associate consultant....do u know how would be the pattern for the test.....actually i'm not prepared for the test and really confused :(........ weather to give it or not but i'm thinking to give a try as its my starting stage....my profile was selected for the position but would the test be only on HR questions or other like reasoning and analyticals .... I can manage HR ones but i'm scared about the other two as i'm not prepared at this moment ...can u plz guide me in this regard.Netra.10th September 2009 From India, Bangalorejeevarathnam6HI netra,Sorry! I was unable to answer ur query. Actually I went out for some official work for whole day. Actually even I hv no idea abt associate consultant. In each and every organisation there will be different designation for same profile. U just take the exam. More over I hope as it will be support job like tech support or cust support.Anyhow u just attend & c for the results. It will gain u the interview experience.CheerzJeeva11th September 2009 From India, BangaloreThis discussion thread is closed.
