Teva will also conduct a \"thorough review of all R&D programs across the entire company,\" with an eye on prioritizing core projects and dumping others, while somehow \"maintaining a substantial pipeline.\"Sponsored By Syneos HealthBlazing a Trail to Clinical Trial Diversity: Four-Part Webinar Series from Syneos Health, Featuring Pharma, Clinical Research and Community Health LeadersThis series will identify obstacles that stifle appropriate patient diversity in trials; unpack the organizational overhaul needed; share how sponsors, patients & investigators have come together to overcome hurdles; and explore how policy innovations can move the industry forward.Register NowRELATED: Teva to shutter Israeli R&D site in company reorganizationAll told, the plan will lead to 14,000 layoffs, about 25% of Teva's total workforce.

The company has had to downsize its guidance again and again thanks to generics pricing pressure and a pile of dealmaking debt.\"These are decisions I don't take lightly but they are necessary to secure Teva's future. We will implement these changes with fairness and the utmost respect for our colleagues worldwide,\" he said.The two-year plan aims to cut Teva's costs by $3 billion by the end of 2019, from an estimated cost base of $16.1 billion for 2017. But the restructuring itself will end up costing the company at least $700 million in 2018, according to a statement.
