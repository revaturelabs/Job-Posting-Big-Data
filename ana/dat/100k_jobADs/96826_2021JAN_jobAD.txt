Perks of the work--snuggling services provided by my \"office staff\" while I write ...Here’s an appropriate follow-up to last week’s post on freelancing tips–the company for which I do my most regular freelancing is in need of some more writers!I’ve been cranking out up to 10K per day for Quality Communication Solutions, but (happily) business is booming, and Steve Brown needs some more writers for his team. QCS takes orders for written work from all kinds of different clients, and Steve distributes the assignments among the writers on his team. If you’d like to apply, you can email him at srbrownqcs@gmail.com, or you can use the website’s contact form to let Steve know you’re interested.Steve has been great to work with–he nurtures his team members with encouragement and (when it’s needed) education. He’s great about communicating and checking in with his writers about the workload, the details of the assignments, and timelines and deadlines. His pay structure for writing assignments is tiered according to the number of words in each piece, and he offers additional bonuses for timely submissions and for writers who complete large word-counts in a week. He pays every Monday for the previous week’s work, using PayPal for the payments.I’ve been enjoying the work–so if you’re looking for an opportunity, I recommend this one! If you do contact Steve, just one favor… Could you please let him know it was Kana who sent you his way? Happy writing, all!Pass it on!EmailFacebookTwitterPinterestRedditPocketPrintLike this:Like Loading...Categories: Today's File, writing•Tags: freelancing, writing•38 thoughts on “Freelance Job Opportunity!”	thesweetkitten says:	December 27, 2011 at 10:22 am	Is this only for Americans, or can we Europeans do this too?LikeLikeReplyKana Tyler says:	December 27, 2011 at 10:52 am	I don’t think there are any geographical limitations (I know the CLIENTS come from all over)–but Steve could answer that more definitively. :)LikeLikeReplycharleymckelvy says:	December 27, 2011 at 10:29 am	You are the poster children from the freelance writing life!LikeLikeReplyTheMindOfFreya says:	December 27, 2011 at 10:29 am	Kana what kind of things do you have to write about in your job? I find this interesting. Also curious if this is for Canadians. Curious!LikeLikeReplyKana Tyler says:	December 27, 2011 at 10:55 am	I believe Canadians would be welcome as well–you can double-check that answer with Steve himself. I end up writing about ALL sorts of things, just about every topic under the sun–whatever a client needs in the way of written text… :)LikeLikeReplylizziecracked says:	December 27, 2011 at 11:10 am	Kana, Thank you so much for posting this! I have already sent an email although I am running out the door – I just wanted to thank you. I have been looking for an opportunity such as this an hope it works out. You Rock!LikeLikeReplylizziecracked says:	December 27, 2011 at 11:12 am	and hope lol..;silly me and a typo.LikeLikeReplyEmily says:	December 27, 2011 at 11:31 am	Thank you so much for this post (and your freelance tips post)!

I appreciate your sharing.LikeLikeReplyMiranda Gargasz says:	December 27, 2011 at 2:59 pm	Thanks, Kana, for posting this. I contacted him. I truly appreciate your sharing.LikeLikeReplyella grey says:	December 27, 2011 at 4:13 pm	Thanks for posting this. I’ve always been a little dubious about freelance jobs. It can be very hard to trust someone without a personal recommendation. I’ve sent off an email, and I’ll just have to wait and see if he gets back to me.I also wanted to say, thanks for writing a great blog. It’s refreshing to read such an honest account of someone’s life.LikeLikeReplyMerridy says:	December 27, 2011 at 9:45 pm	Thank you so much for reading my blogs..I enjoy following yours, you truly are a talented writer!!!LikeLikeReplysocietyred says:	December 27, 2011 at 10:20 pm	Thanks Kana for checking out my site and following. You have an intriguing life and I envy your energy and accomplishments. I look forward to getting to know you more and exploring more of your work. I started blogging only a few months ago and it seems like I found an entire new world, like when Dorothy’s house landed and everything was suddenly colorful. Thanks again!LikeLikeReplyKana Tyler says:	December 27, 2011 at 10:22 pm	A perfectly apt description–I’ve found the same vibrant new world in my own few months of blogging. :) Glad to meet you!LikeLikeReplyMalcolm Newell says:	December 28, 2011 at 4:25 am	Thanks Kana, it’s something I’ve really not thought about before – where do all those words come from? There has to be someone out there writing all this “content”, I’ve rekindled my interest in writing and poetry as a result of starting my blog, so I’ll certainly investigate this a bit more. Thanks so much for the tip, and good luck to you, you are one very resourceful lady!LikeLikeReplyBeth, just being me says:	December 28, 2011 at 12:18 pm	Thanks Kana! I just sent Steve an email with links to writing samples and my professional resume. Keeping my fingers crossed.LikeLikeReplyAnonymous says:	December 28, 2011 at 9:52 pm	…only if I can borrow your office staff!LikeLikeReplyAnonymous says:	December 28, 2011 at 9:57 pm	Huh. Shows how much I know about blogging. I just realized that I’m shown as “Anonymous.”. Oops. Grandy :)LikeLikeReplyPat says:	December 29, 2011 at 8:34 am	I love the “office” shot! Cute staff!LikeLikeReplyPingback: Versatile Bloggers Award! « \"M\" is for Marriage and Motherhoodriatarded says:	December 29, 2011 at 5:57 pm	Thank you Kana!Just one thing, the link to the company’s website doesn’t work because there is an extra http:// in the link.It’s not a problem but it would be easier for other readers if you edited that bit! :)LikeLikeReplyKana Tyler says:	December 29, 2011 at 6:26 pm	Woops, thank you! Fixed it. ;)LikeLikeReplyDan McCullough says:	January 1, 2012 at 8:52 am	Thanks for the lead! I sent a letter and a link to my blog. I hope it works out. Have a great 2012!LikeLikeReplysnagglewordz says:	January 4, 2012 at 4:42 am	Reblogged this on Snagglewordz and commented:Attention! Attention! Aspiring freelance writers, make sure you take advantage of this opportunity. The relaxed (not to mention cute) office staff in the photo should be incentive enough. For those of you who don’t already follow Kana’s Chronicles…trust me, start following now! Kana’s blog is honest, engaging and full of excellent writing. She also has an earlier post that will be of interest to you, “A Forum on Freelancing” http://kanatyler.com/2011/12/22/a-forum-on-freelancing/.LikeLikeReplypamelazimmer says:	January 4, 2012 at 1:36 pm	This is awesome. I have been looking to break into the freelance world… Thanks! :)LikeLikeReplyLiza Kane says:	January 11, 2012 at 12:21 pm	Thank you for sharing this information! Your career path has been an inspiration to me! ^_^LikeLikeReplyM Vitalis says:	January 31, 2012 at 11:27 am	Kana, I have just written a poem that I think it might be worth something (monetary speaking). Do you know who might be interested in my poem? And, do you know if I can sell it but still maintain my rights to it? Please Kana, I would love your advice. Thank you so very much.LikeLikeReplyM Vitalis says:	January 31, 2012 at 11:57 am	Oh, Kana, I got so excited when I thought of my poem being worth some money that I did not properly write my comment. I hope you don’t mind me asking all these questions.LikeLikeReplyKana Tyler says:	February 6, 2012 at 8:44 pm	Not at all–and sorry for the delay in replying. Poetry is a tough sell when it comes to getting paid… My M.F.A. is in “Creative Writing, Poetry,” and I’ve published a fair bit of it (including–my favorite–in an anthology of Idaho Women Poets) but I have yet to get PAID for poetry… Having said that, it’s not impossible, either. ;) My best recommendation would be to check out the 2012 Poet’s Market , which is a great resource for pretty much every publication everywhere that publishes poetry, with all the specs on how to submit, what (or if) they pay, what types they’re looking for, whether they accept simultaneous submissions (meaning you can send a poem to multiple publishers at the same time… or not), what percentage of submissions they accept, and all those good stats. (There’s also a more general Writer’s Market publication, fantastic resource with all the same sort of info, but including more genres…)And good luck! :)LikeLikeReplyAnonymous says:	February 7, 2012 at 6:42 am	Wow, Kana, THANK YOU SO MUCH for your reply! I truly appreciate it! And thank you so much, also, for all the important information you are sharing. You know, since I started blogging, I have come to realized how impulsive I am when I am excited about something. I mean, there is way too much stuff I still need to learn about writing, especially poetry. However, I will check the Website out, because right now, I am very exited about it! :) Thanks again Kana. God bless!P.S. I would love to read your favorite poem. Is it here in your blog?LikeLikeReplyJennifer Vidal says:	February 7, 2012 at 6:59 am	Great recommendation! I see they also have one called 2012 Writer’s Market; I think I will be buying it. Thank you so much again, Kana!LikeLikeReplyJennifer Vidal says:	February 7, 2012 at 7:02 am	BTW, the anonymous comment it’s mine. I don’t know why it say anonymous.LikeLikeReplyKana Tyler says:	February 7, 2012 at 9:54 am	It’s not… yet. Maybe that’s today’s post ;)LikeLikeReplyJoin the Conversation!
