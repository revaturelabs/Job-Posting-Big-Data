"Dream Job – Ms. Sonia SandhuSkip to contentMs. Sonia SandhuMenuHomeAbout Me18 ThingsBlogCreative WritingResumeContactDream JobPublished on November 8, 2013 July 21, 2017 by MsSoniaSandhu	Often I’ve been asked in interviews and sometimes during intense career conversations with my parents, “Sonia, what do you even want to do?”As a kid, I really wanted to be an “N.R.” (That was my way of making a career as a news reporter sound even cooler). Somehow, in the years I was added to the equation and I ended up as an N.R.I. (Non-Resident Indian). It’s weird how that materialized. Since that dream, I’ve had many different kinds of dreams and aspirations.Today, I am a communication student pursuing a publishing minor, along with a background in business. When I googled all the things I could get into with a communications major, the choices were endless! The list of titles was overwhelming.Despite studying the list thoroughly, I am still not able to answer the dream job question with enough certainty. But there are some things that I do know. I know that I’d like to be working…… in branding… in a creative environment… around the world… towards helping not-for-profits or even for profit companies with strong focus on sustainability… with people… to create a positive difference in the world… design and campaign building… with some public speaking/public relations workBut I’m sure that as I spend more time in the workforce and as long as I continue to do the things I enjoy doing, eventually I will end up in my dream job! And it’ll happen for you as well. Just keep doing the things you enjoy and do them for the right reasons. I promise success will find you!And yes:Rate this:Share this:FacebookLinkedInPinterestTwitterWhatsAppMoreSkypeTumblrPrintEmailLike this:Like Loading...RelatedCategories Blog•Tags branding, career advice, career conversations, dream job, success	Post navigationPrevious What do you do for yourself?Next Exercising Creativity, Being CreativeSite Hit Counter13,246 hitsSubscribe to BlogEnter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.Join 1,463 other followers	Email Address:	FollowFollow MeInstagramLinkedInTwitterPinterestSpotifyInstagramNo Instagram images were found.Tweet Tweet TweetMy TweetsInstagramTwitterPinterestLinkedInEmailCreate a website or blog at WordPress.comAdd your thoughts here...
