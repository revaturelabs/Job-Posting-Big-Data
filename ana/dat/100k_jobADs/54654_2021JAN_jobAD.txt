These latter discs are known as vented discs. Some high end vehicles now use carbon or ceramic rather than mild steel as these are generally lighter and more robust - although a lot more expensive!Some discs are manufactured with a groove pattern or have drilled holes in them, this aids cooling but the main reason is to allow the escape of the gasses produced by the friction between the disc and pads under heavy or prolonged braking.When the brakes are applied, the two brake pads either side of the disc are forced into the disc surface and “clamp” on to it. The friction slows the speed in which the disc is rotating and thereby slows the vehicle.How do you know there is something wrong with your brake discs?If you experience vibration whilst braking.If the car start to pull to one side under braking.If you notice (or are advised on an MOT) that the disc surfaces have developed scores, pit holes or cracks.Please note, if you see a surface of fine rust on a mild steel disc after rain, this is quite normal and will rub off once the brakes are used a couple of times.When should you consider replacing a brake disc?Brake discs will gradually become thinner due to the friction between them and the brake pads.This wear and tear can be hastened by inappropriate brake pads being fitted, worn brake pads and excessive hard braking. If you can see a rough surface you brake pads will feel it! It will be like running the pads over a cheese grater and they will wear out very quickly!If the brake discs have worn out prematurely or if you are experiencing trouble under braking, it is advisable to seek the help of an expert to investigate the problem and, if necessary, replace the discs as soon as possible. Driving with brakes that do not function properly can, of course, lead to dangerous situations on the road.Brake discs are supplied and fitted in axle pairs (i.e. front or rear). It is equally important to have new brake pads fitted at the same time otherwise any wear pattern on the pads from the previous discs could severely reduce the contact area between the two. This is so important that no mechanic would consider doing otherwise.How common are brake disc replacements?Due to the wear and tear on the surfaces, discs are frequently changed during the life time of a vehicle. Usually this is mileage related, but also the vehicles use and weight can mean more frequent changes.You should expect to have it done once your car has covered anything between 15,000 and 50,000 miles.A visual examination of the braking system of your car is included every time it is servicedHow can I extend the lifetime of my brake discs?As with most parts of your car, the less pressure you put on any part of your car’s brakes, the longer they will last. If you carry heavy loads frequently, or tow a caravan for example, your brake system will come under greater pressure than it would otherwise and as such the discs may wear prematurely. Therefore, removing unnecessary weight from the vehicle will not only improve your fuel consumption, it will reduce the wear on the brakes.Also consider your driving style. Anticipating the road conditions ahead, keeping your speed as constant as possible, and thereby avoiding sharp braking are all likely to lengthen the interval between brake disc replacements.What happens during a brake disc replacement?Mechanic will inspect the brake discs.If necessary, the brake discs will be replaced along with new brake pads.Mechanic will check the brake system and, if deemed safe, will do a test drive.How much does a brake disc replacement cost?The cost of a brake disc replacement depends on your car and what parts your car's manufacturer recommends using for the replacement.

In addition, we ask all customers to review their mechanic so we can remove any unprofessional mechanics from the network and ensure that the standard remains high.We have a dedicated customer service team based in London to assist you and ensure your booking goes smoothly.2Who are the mechanics?The mechanics are a nationwide network of independent garages and mobile mechanics. We rigorously vet the mechanics before they join the network to ensure they have:At least 5 years work experience (average is 20 years)At least City & Guilds level 2 mechanic qualification (or better)Public liability & trade insuranceFurthermore, our users rate the mechanic after each job, meaning we quickly remove any unprofessional mechanics from the network.3Is there a warranty for your services?Yes. All repairs & services come with a 12-month warranty on both labour and parts. If there’s any defects in the workmanship we’ll work with you to get it resolved at no extra cost.4Do I pay more for the mechanic to come to me?In almost all cases, no. Collection & delivery is included in your quote. If your car isn’t drivable, and the work can’t be done by a mobile mechanic then some garages will charge a recovery fee. If this is the case, our customer service team will be in touch to let you know in advance, and you’re under no obligation to accept the increased price.5Is there a cancellation fee?You can cancel your booking with no fee up to 24 hours before the booking. If you cancel within 24 hours of the scheduled visit, then you’ll be charged a £20 fee, which will increase to £40 if the mechanic has started travelling to your location.6Can I supply my own parts?No. We don't offer a labour only service where you provide your own parts. This is because all mechanics operating in the network must offer a 12-month warranty on their repairs, and so must be able to guarantee the quality and suitability of all parts supplied.Booking1I'm not sure what's wrong, what should I do?If you don’t know what’s wrong, we recommend booking a diagnostic inspection and we’ll send a mechanic to find and fix your fault.2When can I book in for?You can book in 7 days a week, 8AM-8PM. We ask for a day's notice when making a booking, so that we can connect you with a mechanic and they can source the parts.3I can't find my repair, help!No problem! Please email us at support@clickmechanic.com with your repair details, registration and postcode and we'll send you a tailored quote.4When do I pay?You will be charged only when the mechanic has completed the work to your satisfaction, and you've given the go-ahead to invoice.5Why do you need my card details?Much like a hotel, we need your card details to reserve your booking and guarantee payment for the mechanic. You won't be charged a penny until the mechanic has completed the work to your satisfaction and you've given the go-ahead to invoice.On the day1What happens on the day?On the day the mechanic will call you to let you know exactly when they will arrive. Then they'll introduce themselves and either take your car to the garage or get on with the work you've booked.Once the work has been finished, your mechanic will explain the work they've carried out. Once you're happy and give the go-ahead to invoice, then you'll be charged by the mechanic through the ClickMechanic app and your receipt will be emailed directly to you.2Will I get a mobile mechanic or a garage?For most jobs, we'll send them to both mobile mechanics and independent garages. For jobs that can't be done at the roadside, we'll connect you to a garage, and if your car isn't drivable then we'll connect you with a mobile mechanic.3Do I need to be present for a pre-purchase inspection?No, though the mechanic will need to be able to access the car, so it’s best to liaise with the seller to ensure that they will be available.4What if the mechanic finds I need a different repair?If your mechanic attends the booking and finds that the work requested is not the correct diagnosis, the mechanic will assess the vehicle to identify the correct issue. He will then charge the booking at the cost of a diagnostic inspection and you will receive an email receipt reflecting this. If the mechanic can help with repairing the vehicle, they will also send through an additional work quote for the correct repair.5Can the mechanic do the repair by the roadside?Most repairs can be done by the mobile mechanics on our network. Some jobs will require a workshop, and if this is the case we’ll find you a garage who will collect & return your car - so there’s no need for a trip to the garage.Didn't find what you need?
