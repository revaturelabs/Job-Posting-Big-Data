The new platform will ensure the recruitment process becomes a lot more efficient and effective for both employers and job seekers. We firmly believe that It will provide a one-stop-shop for all job seekers that need to find the right job, whilst also enabling employers to reach the best talent,” said Naomi De Silva, Founder Ace Connekt.As a one-stop shop recruitment hub, an employer has the ability to hire at any level – from clerical staff to the CEO. Additionally, while job seekers can easily create a profile for prospective employers to view, differently abled and persons with special needs can also create their profiles. Even small business owners or service providers can hire though this platform with ease.To ensure the platform is effective, saves both cost and valuable time, there are a series of exclusive in-built features. These include; the ability to filter job seekers according to various categories and segments, where employers can download profiles in the form of a CV for perusal later, to short-list job seekers and maintain an auto generated list, also to directly schedule interviews through the platform via phone, via skype/zoom or in person.Another important feature of the platform is the ability for companies to view and hear the candidate through self-images and a unique Video CV. This short 1-2 minute video CV enables employers to evaluate candidates through the video they have uploaded.Additionally, for job seekers, the platform provides a pool of companies and access to unlimited job opportunities, a hassle and worry free template to prepare professional CVs and vast opportunity for prospective companies to view and hear your story.Confidentiality is also assured and maintained as contact details (email, contact no etc.,) will only appear to the employer once an invitation has been accepted.For both employers and job seekers, the platform provides notifications, and interview reminders to be on track and to know which companies have viewed your profile.The platform has been developed by talented in-house staff who, have welcomed the ability to infuse their expertise knowledge and experience in human resource management and business management.Ace Connekt was envisioned under the wings of Amarion Career Consultancy Firm (Pvt) Ltd after discovering the need for a platform such as this, to provide a win-win situation for both the employer and job seeker and also to create new job opportunities.Previous PostComBank launches CBC Finance as successor to Serendib FinanceNext PostINSEE Cement drives innovative research as main sponsor of 11th International Conference on Sustainable Built Environment 2020Related NewsGive your productivity a massive boost in 2021 with smart multi-devices powered by EMUI 11publisherJanuary 21, 2021 January 21, 2021MillenniumIT ESP Continues its Silver Jubilee Celebrations at Hybrid Town Hall EventpublisherJanuary 21, 2021 January 21, 20214 must-have cybersecurity skills for youth to combat cyber threatspublisherJanuary 20, 2021 January 20, 2021Samsung Galaxy S21 Series: The Ultimate Smartphone Experience, Designed to be Epic in Every WaypublisherJanuary 20, 2021 January 20, 2021MOST VIEWED1	TrailSL draws to an endwith the support of SriLankan Airlines team membersadmin0.9K2Globally acclaimed ‘World’s first wildlife travel-based management lessons book’ by Wilfred Sarath Eranga Perera to be launched in Sri Lanka.publisher6453Classic Destinations, one of the First DMC to receive ‘Safe & Secure Certification’ from SLTDApublisher5114Emirates expands its operations in the Americas in line with increased passenger demandpublisher4665HEALTHCARE HEROES AT IDH RECOGNIZEDpublisher456ArchivesJanuary 2021 (150)December 2020 (210)November 2020 (188)October 2020 (222)September 2020 (238)August 2020 (194)July 2020 (212)June 2020 (182)May 2020 (141)April 2020 (131)March 2020 (180)February 2020 (210)January 2020 (186)December 2019 (180)November 2019 (185)October 2019 (232)September 2019 (173)August 2019 (197)July 2019 (169)June 2019 (96)May 2019 (186)April 2019 (94)March 2019 (178)February 2019 (163)January 2019 (169)December 2018 (180)November 2018 (190)October 2018 (179)September 2018 (179)August 2018 (217)July 2018 (229)June 2018 (135)May 2018 (187)April 2018 (150)March 2018 (210)February 2018 (195)January 2018 (195)December 2017 (191)November 2017 (253)October 2017 (265)September 2017 (219)August 2017 (293)July 2017 (133)June 2017 (192)May 2017 (225)April 2017 (147)March 2017 (277)February 2017 (97)January 2017 (103)December 2016 (114)November 2016 (214)October 2016 (241)September 2016 (152)August 2016 (133)July 2016 (207)June 2016 (201)May 2016 (210)April 2016 (184)March 2016 (143)February 2016 (130)January 2016 (188)December 2015 (193)November 2015 (226)October 2015 (257)September 2015 (238)August 2015 (187)July 2015 (196)June 2015 (175)May 2015 (186)April 2015 (135)March 2015 (181)February 2015 (158)January 2015 (104)Ceylon Business Reporter is the premier business reporting website in Sri Lanka.
