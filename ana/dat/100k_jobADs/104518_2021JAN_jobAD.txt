The only intervention of the recruiter is to greet you by saying, \"Well, tell me about yourself!\" It's about presenting your CV and your motivations for the job.The dirigiste interviewIt is not you who lead the game partly or partially. You are asked to answer some typical questions. Your personality will be laid bare: your training, your social origins, your family situation, your experiences, your distractions, your goals, etc…The interview \"technical review\"You are placed in front of a hypothetical case that may intercept you while you are exercising the proposed job position, such as asking a seller to sell goods that he does not necessarily know of, to judge his persuasion abilities, or to be a candidate for a marketing job by adjusting an enhanced promotional campaign plan with appropriate supports, etc.Highlight your abilities when interviewing.Put all the power points on your side.Deal with your candidacy without pressure:Stress management can be an essential part of the job search.

To avoid difficult situations and stay positive, it is better to take a step back and follow some basic principles. Succeeding your interview does not just require skill. It also requires a solid mind. The day before the interview, we must prepare appropriate and relevant answers in order to achieve this decisive stage. And in order to avoid anxiety attacks and to maintain your calm and efficiency, you must not underestimate and on the other hand, you need to learn how to emphasize yourself. However, two principles must be put in mind:Repeat the exercise several times until you feel ready. Forget your reserve, take out a microphone or a mirror and answer in a loud voice the questions of the fictitious employer and do not hesitate to record everything to identify your mistakes. For example language tics and signs of stress are details to be carefully monitored.The ideal CV does not exist, no more than the ideal candidate.In general there is no ideal candidate or CV, but there is an appropriate candidate who can be the best in the position he occupies, whatever the company is. An ideal candidate would actually be a standard candidate. But the recruiters are not interested in ready-to-wear. They want tailor-made.How to prepare for a job interview?Like sport, the best preparation for interviews is training. In order to be successful, it is necessary to acquire practice.

Back up your seat so you can talk easily to each person in front of you.Attach so much respect to each of your interlocutors regardless of his or her rank... While speaking to your interlocutor, make them feel that you are also talking to them even if they do not lift their noses from their computers or their writings.Keep in mind that after your departure the person who received you will take the advice of these \"spectators\".
