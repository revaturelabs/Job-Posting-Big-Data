I hope you find it of interest.This information is gathered from employers across every sector, what is interesting is that the construction and technical sector continues to rank amongst the highest in terms of skill shortages.Here are some of the key findings:89 per cent of employers will increase or maintain their temporary workforce in the next three months.This is a rise of nine percentage points compared to findings reported in March (80 per cent), suggesting that businesses may become increasingly reliant on temporary workers.The survey of 606 employers also reveals:33 per cent report having no spare workforce capacity within their organisation46 per cent anticipate a shortage of candidates to fill permanent roles in the next year, with construction, engineering & technical, and health & social care highlighted as particular areas of concernIn the three months to April, one third (34%) of employers felt that UK economic conditionswere improving. This is compared to 27% of employers who thought the economy was worsening. However, marginally more large employers (250+ employees) felt the economy was worsening (29%) than improving (28%). Large employers were also the least content about making hiring and investment decisions as a consequence.The UK workforce increased by 122,000 in January–March 2017 compared to October–December 2016. Self-employment decreased by 13,000, with a 14,000 decrease in self-employed part-timers and a 1,000 increase in self-employed full time workers. Temporary employment fell by 31,000 whereas permanent employment rose by 167,000. The UK workforce was 381,000 higher than the same period in the previous year. Year-on-year, permanent employment increased by 350,000, self-employment increased by 82,000, and temporary employment fell by 68,000.Intersect Global have a range of permanent and contract vacancies, many are listed on our website but not all are.Please get in touch if you would like us to help you with your next career move or contract assignment.
