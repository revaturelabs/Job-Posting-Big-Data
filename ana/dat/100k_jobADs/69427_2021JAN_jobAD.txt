Each person has unique contributions that he or she can offer in the workplace. People have experience, talents, skills and fields of knowledge that they have developed throughout their lifetimes whether on the job, in school, at home or in volunteer positions. Coaching provides time for reflection and discovery. It also provides time for clarification of work life/ balance goals and personal as well as professional values.
