Think of a job and show it in a SP-Studio picture! You can just create a character in his typical uniform, but you can also show his whole working environment. You don't have to choose a specific job as long a your picture fits the topic in some way. For example you could comment on unemployment as well.HOW TO JOIN:If you are new: Register a nickname by clicking on the REGISTER button in the menu on top of this page.Then you can upload your picture to the contest gallery.The pictures will all show up on July 16, before this they are hidden. Then everybody can vote.RULES:The picture must be created at sp-studio.de and submitted here till July 15th, 11:59 PM (GMT+1).No editing with additional software! No effects, color change, zooming. Just SP-Studio pictures.You are allowed to rotate the picture.Add a fitting English title & description (optional). You can add reference links. No text like \"VOTE!!!\".If you upload more than one picture for a contest the newest counts and the others are deleted.When the voting starts registered users can rate the pictures (1-5 stars) until July 31.Vote fair! Do not manipulate results by telling friends to give you 5 stars and others 1 star. I will ban you for this.PRIZES:1st place: Make a wish for a new SP-Studio item and I will draw and include it.1st to 5th place: You win your own User Gallery. If you already have one you can upload 30 more files to it now.Janina's Choice: I might pick one additional person, if I think he/she deserves a user gallery. The score doesn't matter.Good luck!Report ContentJetpack-guyGuestJul 4th 2013#2Im in, had to quickly make a picture (Due to travelling later today) , probably won't be my best.Report ContentStriderPosts351Jul 11th 2013#3Can be evil and crime considered as jobs?< Crime and evil, that's my job!Let's get ready for an allowed Joker invassion!Report ContentJaninaAdministratorPosts2,088LocationGermanyJul 12th 2013#4SureReport ContentDavidePosts14Jul 14th 2013#5Posted mine !Report ContentJaninaAdministratorPosts2,088LocationGermanyJul 16th 2013#6I am sick in bed with fever, so the vote will start a couple of hours later.EDIT: But now you can vote :).Report ContentStriderPosts351Jul 17th 2013#722 pictures (disqualified ones included)...Get well soon, Janina!Report ContentJaninaAdministratorPosts2,088LocationGermanyAug 1st 2013#8Thanks, it took way too long but now I am back and there will be the promised background-updates :).
