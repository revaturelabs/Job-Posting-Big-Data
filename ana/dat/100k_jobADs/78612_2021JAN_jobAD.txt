The legislative goal was the “expansion of a more robust workforce development program within the FDOT, by prioritizing training and recruiting workers to support construction of multi-use infrastructure and facilities accommodating emerging technologies to facilitate creation of a better trained workforce throughout the state, and particularly within communities in which the FDOT constructs projects.”The legislation authorized funding for the Statewide Workforce Development program at $2.5 million a year for Fiscal Years 2020, 2021 and 2022.The Statewide Workforce Development Program provides opportunities to build successful careers and improve lives. Through the program, the Florida Department of Transportation works with community partners to connect adult jobseekers with contractors who are hiring for road and bridge construction projects. The program also informs students about pathways to careers in the transportation industry.The program objectives are:Attracting adult workers and students to a career in road and bridge constructionRecruiting workforce to meet the current and future needs of the transportation construction industryTraining the construction workforce in traditional and emerging construction methods and techniquesProviding support services to remove barriers for workers to be successful in pursuing a career in road and bridge construction.Adult-targeted ActivitiesGroup Recruitment, Training and HiringContractors Job-Readiness Hiring and TrainingCorrectional Transition AcademyOnBoard4Jobs Construction CareersStudent-targeted ActivitiesFlorida Construction Career Days ParticipationStudent Construction InternshipStudent Construction Career AcademyWhat’s the Florida Department of Transportation and what does it do?The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) is an executive agency reporting to the Governor.
