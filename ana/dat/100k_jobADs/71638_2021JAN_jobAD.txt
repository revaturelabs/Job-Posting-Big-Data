The link is here: http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&gid=4269106The Group has over 1,700 members so far – read more on last week’s blog: http://alturl.com/qmssoRecruiters & Head-huntersThis group is independent, so we hope that any and all recruitment and head-hunting firms will start to use the group, and post vacancies to the ‘Jobs’ section. They (and anyone else) are also welcome to advertise their services on the “Discussions” section.These people posted Jobs discussions this week (I will expand this list over the next few weeks, into a global list of recruiters, and save it on my shared ‘Box’ folder: https://www.box.net/shared/bxrprfdfr7 ).
