Welcome to Bourbon City®.Yes, Bourbon is a spirit that comes in a glass, but it’s also a spirit that defines our culture and compassion, our arts and parks, our creative energy. It’s this same spirit that continued and created Louisville itself - a city that combines heritage with innovation, authenticity with originality, quirkiness with friendliness in a way that’s completely unique to our region.We’re an entirely different type of Southern. From boundary pushing twists on Southern cuisine that have made us one of the “10 Best New Food Cities” in America to our one and only Urban Bourbon Experience™, featuring the world’s only, city-wide trail filled with award-winning micro-distilleries, exhibits and craft cocktail destinations. Then discover one-of-a-kind attractions like the legendary Churchill Downs, Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory, and the Muhammad Ali Center. And that’s just your first day here.In fact, you may love Louisville so much, you’ll want to move here.Kentucky DerbyMay 1, 2021DAYS394HRS01MIN16SEC34NewsLouisvilleLouisville Tourism Announces New Position of IT ManagerBourbon City’s Tourism Recovery Starts with LocalsKentucky Derby Museum offering Dreaming of Derby dealWhat’s Ahead for Louisville’s Tourism EconomyBourbon City Toasts Boom in Hotel DevelopmentAffordable, Dope, Hipster & TrendingMust SeeLouisvilleEst. 1778Personalized Travel PlanningGet Tips From Louisville Locals for Your VisitLearn MoreEst. 1778Can't Miss ExperiencesWith a booming bourbon renaissance, iconic attractions, world-class hotels & venues and a renowned culinary scene, Louisville is an experience like no other city.Learn MoreEst. 1778Bourbon CountryBut for the true connoisseur of great whiskey, great food and great times, there is only one place that allows you a sensual and sensory experience that is truly unique to America.Learn MoreExperience LouisvilleNeighborhoodMapNuluPortlandDowntownButchertownClifton & Crescent HillEast EndWest LouisvilleOld LouisvilleGermantownThe HighlandsSouth Points Scenic AreaSouthern IndianaNeighborhoodsNuluPortlandDowntownButchertownClifton & Crescent HillEast EndWest LouisvilleOld LouisvilleGermantownThe HighlandsSouth Points Scenic AreaSouthern Indiana38°FBook A RoomRequest Visitor GuideVisitor CenterEmail SubscribeJOIN OUR NEWSLETTERSStay Up-To-Date with The Latest Happenings Around Louisville!Sign UpContact UsAbout UsHospitality WorksCalendar Of EventsFacebookInstagramTwitterYouTubePinterestGet The Guide401 West Main StreetLouisville, Kentucky 402021.888.LOUISVILLE (1.888.568.4784)"
