When it comes to landing a job interview for dental assisting if you get the call, you’ve already made a good first impression on paper. Next up is to make a great impression in person during your dental assistant job interview.What to Do During Your Dental Assistant InterviewShow Up Prepared to the InterviewResearch the practice before you interview. Read the company’s website, social media posts, and online reviews, and ask people you know what they know about the office and the dentists.Review the job posting before the interview so that you have a strong understanding of the job’s expectations.Bring a couple of clean, smooth copies of your resume. Your interviewer should already have your resume on hand, but it’s good to offer a copy if they don’t have one or if another person unexpectedly joins the interview.Think about answers to basic interview questions in advance and be ready with your responses. Common interview questions include: “Why do you want to work here?” “What was a previous work challenge you overcame?” and “What are your strengths?”Ask the Right Dental Assistant Interview QuestionsMost hiring managers will give you an opportunity to ask questions at the end of the interview. Show that you are engaged and interested by asking a few that are relevant to the position or the practice. Have these ready in advance, so you don’t have to come up with one up on the spot.Dress Professionally for the InterviewIf it’s a working interview, you may be expected to wear scrubs. But if it’s a meeting, wear business casual attire. Clothes should be clean, unwrinkled and be free of any holes or stains. When in doubt, opt for more conservative clothing. Avoid bling and jewelry that will make sounds, like metal bangle bracelets.Arrive to the Dental Assistant Interview EarlyIf you are unfamiliar with the location of the interview, map it well in advance so you are confident about how to get there. Leave early enough to allow for unexpected traffic issues that could slow you down. Arrive early enough that you can walk into the interview about five minutes early.What Not to Do During Your Dental Assistant InterviewDon't Arrive Too Early to the InterviewIf you get to the interview site with more than 10 minutes to spare, use that time to prepare and clear your head. Do not walk in more than 10 minutes early. You want to be punctual but also want to make the best use of your time. It doesn’t benefit anyone if you are in the way of a busy dental practice or make the interviewer feel rushed because you are waiting.Don’t Chew Gum or Do Anything Distracting During the InterviewAvoid anything that distracts you and the interviewer from the reason you’re there. Eating food or popping gum can be a big distraction and looks unprofessional. For fresh breath, opt for a mint just before the interview.Don’t Wear Before or Strongly-Scented Lotion to the InterviewAgain, you want to avoid distractions. What smells great to one person can be distracting — or even worse, cause an allergic reaction — for someone else.Don't Check Your Phone During the Dental Assistant InterviewThe focus for you and the interviewer should only be about your qualifications. It looks like you don’t take the interview seriously if you check your phone during it. Put your phone on silent or turn it off.If you are interested in a career as a dental assistant and want the support of a program that will help you prepare for the job and the interview process,
