They can set up criteria and receive email alerts matching with the job offers they are interested in.Jobboard Finder’s opinionSummary: Created in 1999 back when the internet was accessible to about 10% of the population in Hungary, CVOnline is the first job board to appear in the country. It was originally Munkafórum Kft (founded by László Antal and Péter Kovács), the first job board in Hungary, after some interesting investments from CVOnline, an Estonian job board, the name was changed in the early 2000s. This investors include LHV (Lõhmus, Haavel & Viisemann), a big bank in Estonia, and Esther Dyson, a Swiss-born American businesswoman. There is even a graph made in 2014 tracking how far CVOnline (and Hungary) has come since its creation: http://www.15ev.hu/. At the moment, the job board attracts about 666 600 views a month. While that might sound unlucky to some, that makes it one of the top 5 most visited job boards in the country. On social media, the job board isn’t quite as successful: only 249 followers on Linkedin, 26 986 on Facebook and 701 on Twitter.Design: The website is a dominantly blue colour with five different backdrop images (one is a Christmas themed photo) behind the search engine (keywords and the location). The English option works well on the homepage, but you might need to resort to Google Translate for some of the other pages. If you would rather look through different categories, cities, counties or keywords (the most popular keywords listed and the number of jobs that contain them), you can do that too. The jobs per category are listed. The rest of the homepage highlights the blog articles (it’s a shame they stopped being added to last year) and the jobs of the week. In the job listing, you can use the filters (job category, the region, the hours, the education level, the required languages, the experience, the industry, the posting date and the type of recruiter) to narrow down you search, or you can visit the company pages (some of which are customised, and others aren’t). There are 599 employers on the website. Job offers indicate the publication date or the expiry date. Unfortunately, the “About Us” section (and timeline) are hidden away in the “post a job” part of the site.The job board objective: CVOnline aims to make finding a job in Hungary easy!Recruiter observations: To create an account, a phone number is required. Furthermore, you are expected to provide a fiscal number and registration number for the company (they don't check the number though). You can create your job offer and visualise it before purchasing it through the website.Jobseeker observations: It took hours before we recieved our confirmation e-mail. When we did, we realised you don't actually need an account to apply to job offers (you do need a CV or cover letter though).The job offers: There are 5 413 job offers on the website. Industry, engineering and IT are the top categories.Reactivity: They answer within a couple of hours with helpful information.Special features: The blog (nothing new since last year); the jobs of the week; job alerts; the map of CVs (and where they come from); the adverts (three are on Youtube); the pre-filter (where the team can do a quick pre-selection of the CVs for you); the promotion game; the cute mascot.Verdict: The long delay for the confirmation e-mail was strange and inconvenient. All the easy-to-access parts of the website worked perfectly and you don't necessarily need an account but it is still a bit odd.Written by Ali NeillAs the job board tester and blog editor for the Jobboard Finder, Ali works on job boards from all around the world and keeps a close eye on the recruitment trends thanks to a number of sources, including the website's social media pages.Login here for FREE to unlock access to the traffic audience, content and pricing section for more information on CVOnline.hu.Sign up to access this feature, it’s FREE!You already have an account?
