"Full Time RV With A Full Time Job - 5 Things I Didn't Think AbouthomeaboutfacebookyoutubeLatest PostsMoreAll PostsFulltime RV LifeTravelEatsReviewsRenovationsSearchHippie & TechFull Time RV With A Full Time Job - 5 Things I Didn't Think AboutI couldn't help but notice the neighbors in the camp adjacent to ours, watching me at my computer, taking calls from 9 to 5 everyday... I could hear them. \"Why someone would come to a park with their family and sit on the phone all day?\"Disheartening as it is to feel like I'm letting others think less of me, I could really care less. As a matter of fact, it could be just me feeling guilty that I'm not more stressed out. That was actually one of the first things I noticed about full-time RV life. You have to learn to be ok with being less stressed out and having less to do.In other words...it's ok to relax.I used to be gone three weeks out of the month traveling by air to different territories, staying in hotels, constantly running and lonely. When I was home, I was on the third floor working. When I was done working I'd come down to eat and get about an hour with everyone before the bedtime routine started.That was my typical day and the weekends were devoted to yard and housework.I have an amazing job at PreSonus Audio Electronics. I get to work with amazing people selling tools that allow people to make music. It's really my dream job. It grants me the ability to work from home and travel all at the same time. There are many sales jobs that could afford to have someone traveling full time. If you think about it, most of the traveling sales jobs have to pay for flights, hotels, rental cars, and food every time you leave the house. By going out on the road full time, I've cut the companies costs by more than half!So here are the principal hurdles I found, working full time at camp sites:1. InternetThe free wifi at campsites remind me of dial-up if it works at all. There's really no way around it. You'll have to either tether your phone or plan ahead and look at reviews on sites like Campendium. They allow reviewers to list what kind of cell service is available for all suppliers. Also, try to find sites closer to civilization if internet is your lifeline. For me it is. I have a work AT&T phone. I tether and it seems to work ok. We also have a Verizon phone we tether...that seems to work best no matter where we're at.2. DistractionsDogs barking, kids playing, lawn mowers, and roosters (yes, really) will be joining you on your phone calls if you plan on sitting in one spot throughout the day. I learned to walk around wherever we go and get the lay of the land. I make mental notes on where the loud kids, the crazy dogs, and the loud neighbors are. This also can depend on the time of the day.3. RainNot much you can do about this. This is where you establish Dad is on a work call to your kids so they aren't going crazy when making important calls. In a 33' Class A RV...there's not a lot of hiding places. I also work in the Wrangler during important conference calls.4. Making sure your wife has her time tooOne of the biggest mistakes I made, day one, was walking in from work and not thinking about Melissa and her time. Although, everything has changed since we moved into our RV, some things stayed the same. Dinner, Dishes, laundry, and all the joys of parenthood are still there. Plus on top of that add homeschool teacher to the mix. It's important to remember that your office changed to a peaceful quite shaded area with amazing scenery, while your significant other is still stuck 9 to 5 being Mom (or Dad)...sometimes both. We both wanted the lifestyle, just remembering that she needs to have her peaceful time too is important.5. Sunburn (Not really a priority, unless your pasty pale like myself)This one is pretty self explanatory. When making the move into fulltime RV, you tend to notwear your shoes as much. With my pasty complexion, I ended up with sun poisoning on the first day.I have zero negative things to say about working fulltime on the road. You just need to make sure you're able to put in the effort the company is paying you good money to do.With life on the road, I'm able to give more time and effort and with less stress. I'm even hearing from some of our clients that they can hear a difference.- written by TonyFulltime RV LifeRecent PostsSee AllCrowd Safety with KidsOur first two months on the roadAbout ushey!recommend a cool spot to check out?did we meet on the road?keep in touch here!Â© 2019 | hippie and the techThanks!
