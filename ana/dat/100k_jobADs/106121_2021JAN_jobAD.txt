Personal development is very much dependent on your supervisor and the firm is slightly falling behind its peers for salary.\"Second year trainee, London.\"The hours are often very demanding. This is the flip side of the responsibility as being a fully-fledged member of a team, it means we are expected to work the same hours as an associate and we are also expected to be available in the evenings and on weekends when things are busy. This can be tough sometimes, especially when a project is long.\"Second year trainee, London\"Working hours can be rather long and intense at times.\"Second year trainee, London2018\"There are some gaps in our infrastructure. For example, we don't have a costs lawyer.\"Second year trainee, London\"The work allocation can be unpredictable and imbalanced.\"Second year trainee, London\"Some resources, such as precedents and standard forms, can be hard to find and are not always kept up to date.\"Second year trainee, London\"The hours can be long due to the international nature of our work.\"Second year trainee, London\"The workload can be unpredictable sometimes.\"Second year trainee,\"There can be an inconsistency in the content and volume of work and we can occasionally feel like a satellite office.\"First year trainee, London, UK2016\"The hours are long and there's an expectation that you will be willing to drop anything you are doing in order to work regardless of whether you are on holiday etc.\"Second year trainee, London\"Unpredictable hours, weekend work and late nights in the office.\"Second year trainee, London\"The pay difference between US and UK associates.\"First year trainee, London\"The canteen in the London office.\"Second year trainee, Buenos Aires2015\"Occasionally I have unpredictable working hours.\"First year trainee, London\"Occasionally there can be a lack of structure in the work that I am given.\"Second year trainee, London\"I haven't experienced it yet, but I understand that there are times when it can be difficult to maintain a good work/life balance, to meet the needs of the client.\"First year trainee, London\"We don't always have the extra resources which a larger firm might.\"Second year trainee, London2014\"The hours can be unpredictable.\"Second year trainee, London\"Deadlines can be tight, and hours can be long.\"Second year trainee, London\"Sometimes trainees are given tasks which can be daunting, but the support is there if you need it.\"First year trainee, London\"There are high expectations as the calibre of the lawyers is very high, but this is not necessarily a negative.\"First year trainee, London\"Perhaps some departments could have more staff so as to help with the busy and heavy workloads.\"Second year trainee, London\"The unpredictable work-flow can be a bit of an issue at times.\"First year trainee, London\"Sometimes the amount of responsibility we are given is daunting!\"Second year trainee, London2013\"Exposure (and early) to high level work can be quite daunting. It is a steep learning curve so thick skin and an acceptance that you will make lots of mistakes while you learn is important. Having such a good support network of supervisors, mentors, HR, KM and amongst your colleagues really helps. The Women's Working Group offers great support for female solicitors in particular.\"First year trainee, London\"Massive discrepancies in hours worked depending on supervisor and state of the market.
