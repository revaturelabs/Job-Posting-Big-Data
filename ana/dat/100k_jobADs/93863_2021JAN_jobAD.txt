So take our advice and check your CV to see it is the best it can be, after all you only get one chance!Avoid these common CV mistakes!!Bad Spelling and GrammarBad spelling and grammar is one of the things most guaranteed to irritate a prospective employer. It may irritate the employer so much that they don't even go on to read your CV. Bad spelling and grammar indicates sloppiness in an individual and a lack of care.Use the spell checker on 'microsoft word', check words up in a dictionary, get a friend to read your CV and check before sendingVariety of Font types and SizesA whole variety of font types and sizes can be off putting and make your CV difficult to read which is a shame if the content is good!Poor formattingDoes your CV have missing bullet points or ones that don't align with the bullet points above?Inappropriate InclusionsMany jobseekers now include their email address on their contact details alongside their telephone number and postal address. Make sure your personal email address portrays the 'right image'though. Sexylegs@hotmail.com orhotjuicylips@hotmail.com are fine for personal use but don't belong on a CV.Be careful as well about the personal interests you list. 'Night clubbing' and 'chatting with friends' is all great fun but doesn't give that interesting dimension to your character.Disorganised StructureMake sure your CV has a logical structure and is easy to navigate around. An employer may have a pile of CVs to work through and will at a glance want to determine whether you are worth contacting. Making it difficult for him/her to find out things about you will risk them taking the easy route of going on the next CV.Too Short or Too Long!Your CV needs a decent amount of white space on it. An employer will not want to trawl through wordy paragraph after paragraph. Try and make your points in the most succinct way possible. Use bullet points. Your CV length should not exceed 2 or 3 pages.Conversely don't make your CV too basic so there's insufficient information to attract interest.Lack of Achievements!Does your CV provide an endless, featureless list of tasks that you've undertaken? If you're a hairstylist an employer will have expected you to have cut hair and dealt with customers. What they want to glean from your CV is your achievements, what you learnt or achieved whilst carrying out your current and previous roles.Bring to your CV what makes you special and uniqueEmployment datesMake sure your employment history starts with your current or most recent job and works backwards. And don't leave large, unexplained gaps in your employment history. If you took time out to bring up your kids before they went to school or took time out to learn a new skill, say so. There's nothing wrong with what you did.Don't leave an employer to make their own conclusions that might be worse than the reality of the situation!Non-Tailored CVLots of jobseekers don't appreciate the importance of a tailored CV. If you've been a beauty therapist but are looking to become a beauty products sales rep, make sure you bring out in your CV all of the experiences and accomplishments during your time as a beauty therapist that would suggest you will be good at selling products.Perhaps you sold more Dermalogica products than any other therapist at your salon earning you bumper commission, perhaps you've used the product extensively in customer treatments that you are now looking to sell for.
