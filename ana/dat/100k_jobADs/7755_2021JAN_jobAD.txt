Ireland was one of the countries where the Volvo Ocean Race had a stop over this season. We had the best weather so far this year last weekend, and Galway was shining. The Volvo Ocean race is the second largest sporting event this country ever had, just after the Riders Cup.All this is due to the Irish entry in the Race – the Green Dragon boat. Millions have been invested in the boat by a number of Irish people, and there is a well known Anne Heraty from CPL who is within them and made it all happen.I wish to thank Anne personally. I haven’t been on a Volvo Ocean Race boat before, and it meant a lot to me as a passionate sailor.The Sailing Boats Croatia site has more pictures with Bertie Ahern visiting the Green Dragon.Tags Bertie Ahern, CPL, Galway, Green Dragon, Irish People, Race Boat, Sailing Boats, Sailing Ireland, Volvo Ocean Race	CategoriesJobs Recruitment	Celtic Tiger or Shortage of Workforce in Ireland?Post author By Ivan | JobsBlog.ie	Post date March 3, 20083 Comments on Celtic Tiger or Shortage of Workforce in Ireland?	788 Employers are currently recruiting on Irish Jobs web site. Quit a few of them have a long list of jobs as well. From the employers list of 788 companies the majority has a few or more jobs advertised. The calculation shows quite simple that thousands of jobs are available in Ireland today.Is it a Celtic Tiger all over again? It certainly does not feel so, with even the property prices ‘frozen’ for more than a year now. The unemployment rate is as low as it can be, so if there are thousands of vacancies in Ireland today it is clearly the serious shortage of workers currently in the country. How will that impact the Irish economy? Would we benefit from the increase of the import of “Brain Power”?Tags 123.ie & Richardson Insurance, 20:20 Logistics, 3 Ireland, 4-Site Design Consultants Ltd, 98FM, A & D Wejchert & Partners Architects, A Johnson & Johnson Company, A&L Goodbody Solicitors, Abbey Theatre, Abbott Ireland, ABM Construction Ltd, ABM Data, Abtran, ACC Bank, Accenture Ireland, Access Control Technology (ACT), ACI Worldwide, ACNielsen Ireland, Acorn Life, ActionCoach, Adaptive Mobile Security, ADT, Aer Arann, Aer Rianta International, Aereco Limited, AIB Capital Markets, Alcon Laboratories Ireland Ltd, Alfred McAlpine, Alienware Ltd, All Water Systems, Allergan Medical, Allianz Worldwide Care, Almir, Alstom Ireland, Altran Technologies Ireland, Alzheimer Society of Ireland, Amazon Ireland, American Airlines, Amnesty International, AMO Ireland, An Post, Analog Devices, Analytic Partners, Anthony Nicholas Group, Anthony Reddy Associates, AON Ireland, APC, Apple Computer Ltd, Ardmac, Aró, Arts Council, Arup Consulting Engineers, Arvato Finance Services Ltd, Ascon Rohcon, Ashville Media, Assurant Services Ireland Ltd, Astellas Ireland Co Ltd, Astons Wealth Management Limited, Athy International Concentrates, Atkins Ireland, Atlantis Holiday Group, Atradius Credit insurance, Aussie Pet Mobile, Auto Trader, Avaya, Avery Dennison Ireland Limited, Avocent International, AXA Insurance, B Braun Medical Ltd, B&Q, Babelgum, Backup Power Solutions, Baker Tilly Ryan Glennon, Balfour Beatty Ireland, Ballina Beverages, Banca Mediolanum S.p.A., Bank Of Ireland Asset Management, Bank of Ireland Group, Bank of Ireland Securities Services, Bank of Scotland (Ireland) limited, Barclays, Barretstown Camp, Bausch & Lomb Ireland, Baxter Healthcare Ltd, Baxter Manufacturing, BCD Travel, BD Medical, BDO Simpson Xavier, Bear Stearns Bank Plc, BearingPoint Ireland Limited, Beckman Coulter, Bekin Kids, Belgard Motors, Bell Security, Bene, Best Menswear, Betdaq, BIO-MEDICAL RESEARCH LTD, Bioniche Pharma Group, Biotrin, Biovail Technologies, Bizmart, Blackshore Holdings, Blacktie / Henry Jermyn, Blenders Ltd, Blizzard Entertainment Ireland Ltd, BMC Software, Bon Secours Health System, Bord na Mona, Boston Scientific Clonmel, Boston Scientific Ireland, Bowen Group, Bradley’s Pharmacy Group, Brandmail Solutions Ltd, Brendan J Kelly Auctioneers, Brian McCarthy Contractors, Brian Meehan & Associates, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Brothers of Charity Services, Brothers of Charity Southern Services, Brown Thomas Group, BT Ireland, btw, Bua Training, Budget Travel, Business and Finance, Buy4Now, BWG Foods, Byrne Looby, Byrnes Bookstores & World of Wonder Toy Stores, Cadbury Ireland, Cahill May Roberts, Caledonian Life and Citadel Financial Advice, Calor Ireland, Calyx, Cameron Ireland, Campbell Catering, Campus Oil Ltd, Canada Life Assurance (Ire) Ltd, Candidate Manager, Capella & Solis Hotels, Carbery Group, Career Decisions Ireland, Carluccio’s Ireland Ltd, Carole Nash Insurance, Carphone Warehouse, Catch.fm, Caulfield Supermarket, CB Richard Ellis, Celestica, Centocor Biologics (Ireland) Ltd, Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Irelan, Central Fisheries Board, Central Reservations, Century Management Ltd, CH2M Hill, Changingworlds, Charles River Biological Laboratories, Chase Paymentech, Chesapeake Corporation, Children’s University Hospital -
