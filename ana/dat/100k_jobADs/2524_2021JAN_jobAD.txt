These highly trained, hands-on professionals perform the complex technical functions that are at the core of sub and carrier capabilities.Their job involves everything from operating nuclear propulsion plant machinery, to controlling auxiliary equipment that supports Naval reactors, to maintaining various electronic, propulsion and weapons systems.RESPONSIBILITIESThere are three types of Nuclear Operations jobs for enlisted Sailors. Responsibilities depend on your training, interests and designation. All three of these ratings are eligible to receive up to a $40,000 bonus for first-time enlistment and up to a $100,000 bonus for re-enlistment.Machinist's Mate Nuclear (MMN)Nuclear Machinist's Mates operate and maintain steam turbines and reduction gears used for nuclear ship propulsion and auxiliary machinery such as turbogenerators, pumps and oil purifiers. They also maintain auxiliary machinery outside of main machinery spaces, such as electrohydraulic steering engines and elevators, refrigeration plants, air conditioning systems and desalinization plants. They may also operate and maintain compressed gas producing plants. Nuclear-trained MMs perform duties in nuclear propulsion plants operating reactor control, propulsion and power generation systems. This job is perfect for Sailors with deep interest in math, chemistry, physics and engineering-in other words, it takes hard work and smarts to get you into the reactor room.Electrician's Mate Nuclear (EMN)Nuclear Electrician's Mates are responsible for the operation of a ship's electrical power generation systems, lighting systems, electrical equipment and electrical appliances. The duties include installation, operation, adjustment, routine maintenance, inspection, test and repair of electrical equipment. They also perform maintenance and repair of related electronic equipment. As an EMN, you're responsible for troubleshooting the electric breakers and circuits aboard nuclear-powered ships like aircraft carriers and submarines.Electronics Technician Nuclear (ETN)Nuclear Electronics Technicians operate and perform maintenance on the electronic systems that make the nuclear reactor on Navy ships run. From submarines to aircraft carriers, these Sailors calibrate the actual nuclear control rods to generate power aboard these ships. After your training at Nuclear Power & Prototype School, you'll be part of a watch team that enables the fission process, which generates steam for propulsion. Few can say they get hands-on experience in a nuclear power plant just three years out of high school-you're one of them.Learn more about submarine service, or life on a ship.WORK ENVIRONMENTAs an Enlisted Sailor working in nuclear operations, you'll have the opportunity to work at sea or ashore. Your assignment could also place you in an intense, fast-paced environment aboard a nuclear-powered submarine or aircraft carrier.TRAINING & ADVANCEMENTNAVY NUCLEAR FIELD (NF) PROGRAMUpon completion of initial 7-9 week Recruit Training (known as Boot Camp), those pursuing a Nuclear Operations role report to \"A\" School for technical training based on their specific job rating, and then move on to acquire advanced nuclear training.\"A\" School for MMNs - The three-month Machinist's Mate Nuclear (MMN) course in Charleston, SC provides a basic knowledge of technical mathematics and understanding of the theory and operation of a steam power plant.

This six-month course teaches the fundamentals of a Naval nuclear power plant and the interrelationship of its mechanical, electrical, and reactor subsystems. Students develop oral communications skills, obtain an understanding of nuclear radiation, and gain knowledge of the safe operation of a complex Naval nuclear power plant.For all nuclear power trained ratings, promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It's also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIESBeyond offering access to professional credentials and certifications, Navy technical and operational training in the field of nuclear operations can translate to up to 77 credit hours toward a bachelor's or associate degree through the American Council on Education.
