 New Job…New Mindset 
 Posted on  October 22, 2017  by  Jasmine 
 Last month I was really happy to have started my new job as a Template Designer at an established company, that develops Email Signature Templates. 
 It's been a learning curve and I am still learning new things everyday, the working day is also different each time. I come into the office every morning and never know what's in store for the day. 
 I absolutely love it! 
 My driving has also improved, apart from my mock test (…. yeah… forgetting that ever happened….) and I'm feeling really happy and confident about the big bad roundabouts!!!!!!! 
 It's strange to think this time last year I was about to start my journey to and from Slough everyday… working just round the corner from home is in my opinion, loads better and my mindset is definitely stronger and happier.
