 Worksource Montgomery  |  Career Support  |  Who We Serve  |  Veterans 
 More than 43,000 Montgomery County residents are veterans of the Armed Forces. We are grateful for your service and value the experience you gained in the military. We want to ensure you receive all the employment and training support you need.

 American Job Centers support veterans through knowledgeable staff who know the value and challenges of military experience in the civilian workforce. Dedicated staff are available to help you articulate your military skills and communicate them effectively to civilian employers, connect with veteran-friendly employers, and access benefits specifically available to support veterans. 
 Priority of Service 
 WorkSource Montgomery provides “Priority of Service” to veterans and their eligible spouses in accordance with the Jobs for Veterans Act of 2002 and the Veterans’ Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006. Veteran trained staff assist veteran customers by making sure they have their veteran information correctly displayed in MWE so as to receive priority service. 
 Priority to veterans in given in the following services:
