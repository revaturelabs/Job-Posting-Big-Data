 Looking for someone with GraphQL + React (Apollo client/server. Node/Mongo) experience to help train another developer 1 on 1 (bonus points for TypeScript) and improve their code. 
 This may involve explaining concepts and pair programming on an existing project for 1-2 hours initially. 
 Short 5 minute interviews will be conducted to explain the problem, hear your experience and see if there is a mutual compatibility. 
 Please apply if you are positive, experienced and patient. 
 If the this goes well there may be scope in the future for further freelance work of a similar nature. 
 Many thanks
