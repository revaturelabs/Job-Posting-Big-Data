 Hello Hello, 
 Its Fri-yay! I hope you have had a great week! How are those of you with kids on school holidays coping? Ready to send them back yet?! 
 I’ve had a pretty good week. Very excited as behind the scenes, Brooke from  The Lover Lab  has been giving my little blog a bit of a make over and it’s close to being complete. I can’t wait to share it with you. 
 
 I'm also super excited to be off to the Little Blog Big workshop tomorrow, run by the uber talented Carly from  Smaggle  and Christina from  Hair Romance . (pictured left) Cant wait to meet them both, learn as much as I can and see some of my awesome Bloggy friends.  (photo source) 
 In the meantime, here's some gold I've stumbled upon this week… 
 If you love reading blogs as much as I do, Fleur from Our Urban Box wrote a cracker of a post on  how to support your favourite bloggers . We really do love a bit of comment love! 
 Speaking of bloggers, two of the my faves,  Emma Kate Co  and Jacklyn from  Blog Society  have teamed up in a collective celebration of self care during April, offering a free printable each week. Come and join the celebration… frame them, pop them on your vision board and share on social media tagging #bloglovefest and don't forget to take some time out for just YOU! 
 I shared these  Shedquarters  the other day on the  facebook page , then I saw these  She-Sheds   and  OMG!! I now want to turn the kids cubby house into a She-Shed. Surely they wouldn't mind?! #3 is my fave (pictured). Which do you like? 
 You know how much I love an Ikea hack, check out  these ones  for nursery’s. I adore #8! 
 The lovely Arlene from  Starrtrekking  joined me on my2morrows with this  guest post  during Autism Awareness Week, sharing some honest tips on how best to support families affected by Autism. With 1 in 100 of our kids having Autism, chances are you know someone who would greatly appreciate a casserole and some wine! 
 And on the work/career front, this article about  The Motherhood Penalty  raises the question… how are we meant to ‘lean in’ anyway? 
 Enjoy the links and have a wonderful week end! 
 
 As you head into the week end, how are you taking some time for you? 
 Has the Motherhood Penalty affected you? 
 How would you theme your She-Shed?
