 Spokane Tribe holding job fair Oct. 26 to fill 300 positions for Airway Hieghts casino 
 __ K Morrison

 __ Latest Casino and Gambling News ,  Tribal Gaming ,  Employment & Careers ,  Washington 
 On track to open its  Spokane Tribe Casino  in western  Washington  before the end of the year, the Spokane Tribe is reportedly looking to fill 300 positions at the new facility. 
 According to a report from Spokane-based news/talk radio outlet  KXLY , before the $400 million casino in Airway Hieghts can open for business, more than 300 gaming, food service and management positions need to be filled. 
 A large number of tribal members and their families reportedly showed up for a job and hiring fair last week Thursday. According to the news agency, the tribe will be hosting another hiring event on Thursday, October 26, 2017, at its S.T.E.P. office located in  Airway Heights  at 13918 W. Sunset Highway from 10am to 6pm. The hiring fair is open to everyone. 
 Construction on the Spokane Tribe Casino began in November last year after a 10-year effort was approved by the U.S. Department of Interior in 2015. The Tribe won final approval from Gov. Jay Inslee in June 2016 and a year later  revealed the name and logo  for the new facility. The first phase of what will reportedly be a 10-year development is located at Craig Road and U.S. Highway 2 in Airway Heights, will feature 450 gaming machines, 12 gaming tables, a full-service restaurant, an express deli and a bar situated on the gaming floor. 
 The casino is expected to open prior to the year’s end, with a hotel, entertainment venue, cultural center and police and fire station to be built later.
