 Job: Public Services Librarian 
 Posted on  May 21, 2014  by   sarahgprescott 
 5/21/14 -  Public Services Librarian 
 In concert with the Library Director and the Technical Services Librarian of Northwestern University in Qatar (NU-Q) as well as counterparts on the Evanston campus, the Public Services Librarian works to fulfill the mission of the NU-Q Library to support the information, research, teaching, and learning needs of the NU-Q community. 
 (There is also a Technical Services Librarian position available.) 
 Sarah P 's comments : I have watched the development of Doha's Education City since its inception in 2002. Jobs regularly appear and are filled but the process is vague and the length of time to hire very slow. Salaries are good and Doha is safe but recently has been trending toward becoming conservative.
