 The Jobs Crisis 
 Sunday, August 14, 2011 – The Jobs Crisis 
 Television is not real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs. ~ Bill Gates 
 I know I can act. There aren't too many other jobs I know how to do. ~ Jack Nicholson 
 It's just a job. Grass grows, birds fly, waves pound the sand. I beat people up. ~ Muhammad Ali 
 It's not the most intellectual job in the world, but I do have to know the letters. ~ Vanna White 
 What I'm getting at is, you know, if we really want to get serious about helping all the people living in the street and getting people jobs, we could just hire half the people in the country to spy on the other half. ~ Jello Biafra 
 Religion enables us to ignore nothingness and get on with the jobs of life. ~ John Updike 
 Oh, you hate your job? Why didn't you say so? There's a support group for that. It's called EVERYBODY, and they meet at the bar. ~ Drew Carey 
 Work is the curse of the drinking classes. ~ Oscar Wilde 
 All paid jobs absorb and degrade the mind. ~ Aristotle 
 Executive ability is deciding quickly and getting somebody else to do the work. ~ John G. Pollard 
 A life spent in constant labor is a life wasted, save a man be such a fool as to regard a fulsome obituary notice as ample reward. ~ George Jean Nathan 
 Nothing is really work unless you would rather be doing something else. ~ James Matthew Barrie 
 I have never liked working. To me a job is an invasion of privacy. ~ Danny McGoorty 
 I've met a few people in my time who were enthusiastic about hard work. And it was just my luck that all of them happened to be men I was working for at the time. ~ Bill Gold 
 An unfulfilled vocation drains the color from a man's entire existence. ~ Honoré de Balzac 
 Eventually the person who tries to fix the problem will be blamed for causing it. ~ Robert Brault 
 More men are killed by overwork than the importance of this world justifies. ~ Rudyard Kipling 
 One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important. ~ Bertrand Russell 
 The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people. ~ Karl Marx 
 If you don't like your job you don't strike. You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way. ~ Homer Simpson 
 Adults are always asking little kids what they want to be when they grow up because they're looking for ideas. ~ Paula Poundstone 
 When a man tells you that he got rich through hard work, ask him: "Whose?" ~ Don Marquis 
 Hard work never killed anybody, but why take a chance? ~ Edgar Bergen 
 I think the person who takes a job in order to live - that is to say, for the money - has turned himself into a slave. ~ Joseph Campbell 
 If Botticelli were alive today he'd be working for Vogue. ~ Peter Ustinov 
 Unemployment is capitalism's way of getting you to plant a garden. ~ Orson Scott Card 
 Unemployment insurance is a pre-paid vacation for freeloaders. ~ Ronald Reagan 
 A man willing to work, and unable to find work, is perhaps the saddest sight that fortune's inequality exhibits under this sun. ~ Thomas Carlyle 
 The trouble with unemployment is that the minute you wake up in the morning you're on the job. ~ Slappy White 
 What is the good of being a genius if you cannot use it as an excuse for being unemployed? ~ Gerald Barzan 
 There's no unemployment in squatter cities. Everyone works. One-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that. ~ Stewart Brand 
 A man's labor is not only his capital but his life. When it passes it returns never more. To utilize it, to prevent its wasteful squandering, to enable the poor man to bank it up for use hereafter, this surely is one of the most urgent tasks before civilization. ~ William Booth 
 An unemployed existence is a worse negation of life than death itself. ~ Jose Ortega Y Gasset 
 You take my life when you take the means whereby I live. ~ William Shakespeare, Shylock in The Merchant of Venice

 About This Site 
 
 
 This site offers a daily column on current events, and unlike other blogs, in long form. Short posts pointing to this and that and saying "Oh my!" seems a bit lazy. Columns here are an attempt to think things through. If you'd like to come along for the ride, fine. If you have neither the time nor patience for that, that is also fine - you can click on the LINKS tab at the top of the page and visit the sites that offer quick hits. Those provide the raw material for the analyses here. 
 The views here are mine alone, save for the occasional column from Ric in Paris or comments from key readers, like Rick, the News Guy in Atlanta, and others. 
 Commentary and guest columns are posted here, but there is a sister site,  Just Above Sunset Photography , where images are far more important than words. That site is updated daily. Take a look. 
 JUST ABOVE SUNSET has been online, in various formats, since May 2003. Click on the ABOUT tab at the top of the page for more on that, and a note on who I am.
