 Living Ocean on Assignment 
 Filming on location in Seattle 
 We are producing a new film on aquaculture in the United States - showcasing certain farms that are working hard to do it the right way, while keeping food production in the US and increasing jobs. The film will feature farms in Seattle, Maine and Alabama. Last week we completed our first shoot in Seattle working with the salmon industry. Film to follow in November.
