 John Boehner admits that he has no jobs plan and may have violated federal ethics rules 
 U.S. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) admitted in a Tweet from his government Twitter account that he had no actual plan to help the American economy create more jobs:

 There are not one, but two, things that are very wrong with this. 
 First off, Republicans have no actual jobs plan because they're more concerned with demonizing women, minorities, LGBT people, the elderly, the poor, the young, the non-Christian, and the disabled, suppressing the vote to get Republicans elected, busting unions, taking away health insurance from people who actually need it, making it easier for big banks and other financial institutions to screw over consumers and crater the economy again, protecting bigotry, shipping American jobs overseas, making it harder for people to make their own health care decisions, and driving down wages than doing anything to actually help this country's economy create more jobs. 
 Additionally, the fact that Boehner sent a clearly campaign-related tweet from his government Twitter account may violate federal ethics laws/rules, as, if I'm not mistaken, Members of Congress are legally required to maintain campaign-related social media activity (Facebook posts, Tweets, etc.) on separate social media accounts from accounts used for social media activity legislative business. 
 Congressional Republicans are more interested in implementing a destructive far-right agenda than doing anything to actually grow the American economy.
