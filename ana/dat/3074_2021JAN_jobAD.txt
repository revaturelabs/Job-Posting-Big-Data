 Questions around the future of retail are one thing, but how candidates position themselves to be best placed for that future is the burning question for us. 
 Retailers are grappling with a constantly shifting landscape driven by the move to online, and as such we’ve seen a huge increase in the demand for digital-based skills from our clients when it comes to recruiting. 
 On the flipside, we’ve seen a proportional decrease in the need for more traditional roles such as space planning and print marketing. 
 The trends we’re seeing now are only likely to be further exacerbated in the coming years. This means retailers must, more than ever, answer the needs of their customers, and this shift in mindset is filtering through to their talent acquisition strategies. 
 Return on investment is ever more critical for retailers when profits are under such intense pressure, and that extends to recruitment. 
 We are seeing a massive increase in the number of roles requiring analytical skills, commercial competency and data awareness, not to mention digital marketing and e-commerce experience. There are and always will be some fantastic opportunities in the retail sector, but there is an emerging reluctance on the part of employers to take a chance and offer those opportunities to candidates without plenty of experience already on their CVs. 
 So what can you do to ensure you are ready for the shift? What steps can you take to put you in the best position for 2019 and 2020? For that next move, that next job title, that next salary increase? 
 The answer lies in your current role. Candidates can future-proof their career path by ensuring they are maximising their development and experience in the digital space where they currently work. 
 Any experience you can get working with the digital and analytical teams of your current place of work will be an invaluable addition to your CV and a boost to your confidence. Speak to your line manager and request to widen your job specification. Deepen your job description. Ask to see their future plans and mould your day job around their requirements. 
 Make full use of self-improvement apps such as SkillShare, spend some of your spare time listening and learning about the digital space and how it applies to the part you play in the retail sector. This will mean that in a year or 18 months’ time when you are ready for the move, you can ensure that exciting opportunities of the ever changing retail sector will be available to you.
