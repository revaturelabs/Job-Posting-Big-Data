  5 Tips For Keeping Your New Job  
 RedStarResume 
 May 18, 2014 
 Congratulations on securing your new job! You have been selected over the other job applicants because of all the wonderful factors that made you the best fit.  Related:   Top 5 Mistakes People Make When Starting A New Job  There are many tips for keeping your new job and maintaining a professional image - here are a few: 
 
 1. Understand Your Role And Expectations 
 You may feel as though you are doing a fantastic job, but if your expectations differ from those of your manager or boss, there is going to be conflict. Have a good understanding of what is expected of you. If you feel that the expectations are unrealistic, then you need to approach your boss and explain the situation. One of the most important aspects of maintaining a professional image is being a good team player and contributing fairly to the team objectives. No one likes a colleague who does not do their fair share of the work. 
 2. Expand Your Role And Keep On Learning 
 Be a team player and look to get involved in more areas of the business. Be willing to share your expertise, but also be willing to learn new skills. If your company offers training courses, put your hand up to get involved. If your company doesn’t offer training courses, you can still take the initiative and invest in your own growth and knowledge by paying for these courses yourself. 
 3. Develop Positive Relationships 
 With all of the time we spend at work, it’s important to develop positive relationships with all of our co-workers, managers, and bosses. Good relationships are based on trust. Keep commitments. If you promise something, make sure you deliver on time. However, if you find yourself in a situation where something has changed and you cannot keep that commitment, be honest and communicate. Honest communication is the key to building a long-lasting relationship. 
 4. Be Visible 
 Leaving early every day and not attending social gatherings is definitely not the right way to maintain a professional image. Being visible is all part of being a good team player. This does not mean you have to be best friends with every person you work with, but there is no need to isolate yourself either. 
 5. Ask For Feedback And Learn From Your Boss 
 Do not be afraid to ask for feedback. In order to grow and improve ourselves, we need feedback on how we are performing in our jobs. Positive feedback is always fantastic, however don’t be put down by negative feedback and certainly do not hold grudges. Learn from your mistakes and strive to do better going forward. We spend so many hours at work that we need to enjoy what we are doing. Maintaining a professional image will help you not only build a reputation of someone who is a great team player and can be counted on to add value to the business, but will also make your work life a far greater experience. When the time comes for a promotion or a pay rise, you are far more likely to be considered because of your professional attitude and image.
