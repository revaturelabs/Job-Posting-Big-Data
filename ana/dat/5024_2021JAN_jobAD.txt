  Work With a Career Coach to Land Your Next Job  
 Patricia Erickson 
 May 10, 2010 
 Think career coaches are just for executives? Not anymore. As a matter of fact career coaches work with clients at all levels and from all career backgrounds. Lots of career coaches have reasonable rates and offer affordable packages well worth the investment. 
 If you've been on several job interviews and only made it through the first interview phase, it might be time to consider hiring a career coach to help you enhance your interview skills. Your coach works one-on-one with you to develop skills that will make you much more successful come interview time. Without a coach, you might be missing out on job opportunities! 
 How well do you interview? 
 Get an assessment of your current interview skills to find out! It's a simple process that takes place in the first telephone session. You start by identifying your interview strengths. This allows you to collaborate on strategies that improve your personal interview skills. Through role play and practice interviews, you'll be up to speed in no time.

 Building rapport is a key ingredient to a successful interview, so you'll work on strategies to mirror and match your interviewer conversationally. Because you could be inadvertently sabotaging your interviews with one simple statement or verbal tick, your mock interview sessions will be recorded. You'll be able to decide how you sound and make necessary adjustments. And, you'll get great feedback too. 
 With some one-on-one work and preparation, you'll be ready for anything at your next interview. And, you'll be steps ahead of your competition! 
 You certainly don't have to be an executive to hire a career coach. You don't even have to be intimidated by the price. Many coaches offer laser or abbreviated sessions as well as group teleclasses that are reasonably priced. 
 If you're having no success interviewing, more than likely, it's time to hire a coach. By working with a career coach to land your next job, you're investing in yourself as well as your future success.
