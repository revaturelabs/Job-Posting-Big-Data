 Smorgasbord Laughter Lines - Next time you complain about your job!! And a joke from the archives. 
 Posted on  March 26, 2019  by   Smorgasbord - Variety is the Spice of Life. 
 We all have days when our jobs get us down, but some people have it far worse …. 
 And a joke from the archives ….on the subject of jobs… 
 Salesmanship 
 Sid was told if he did not sell more toothbrushes he would be fired. One month later his sales record had soared and his manager called him in to explain the dramatic turnaround. 
 Sid explained that he had got tired of calling at pharmacies and had set up a little stall at the main train station with some crackers and a new dip. 
 ‘Try my dip,’ he would say, and a constant stream of people did so. When they enquired about the ingredients of the dip, Sid told them: ‘Garlic and Chicken poop!’ 
 They would go ‘Aaaargh!’ and spit it out. 
 Then Sid would say: ‘Would you like to buy a toothbrush?’ 
 Thanks for dropping in today and I hope you are leaving with a smile on your face ….. thanks Sally.
