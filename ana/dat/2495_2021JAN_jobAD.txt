 Invoice Number and Job Number the Same 
 We have delivered another update based upon your feedback. 
 Some customers have asked us to have the Job Number flow onto the Invoice Number, so that the number does not change. 
 Normally, there will be 2 numbers for a transaction: 
 1. The Job Card Number 
 2. The Invoice Number 
 Both of these numbers can be search, so there should not be any reason for this to become an issue if two numbers exist. Even though that's the case, some clients have requested that the there is only one number, and we want to deliver what you want, and have added this new option to the system. 
 You can update this under "Settings"; then "Company Settings". 
 Once again, we hope you find this update valuable. 
 Invoice Number equal job number 
 "Really liking Workshop Software and how professional the invoices look. Support has been great the whole time. They are always consistent in calling us and making sure our questions are answered."

 “After using the software for a month with the Quickbooks integration, we can see that keeping up with parts and records is much easier. The integration helps up with knowing what is going on in the Workshop. Workshop Software is good.”
