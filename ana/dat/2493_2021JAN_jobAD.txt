 THE JOB AT BACKBASE 
 As a Solutions Engineer in the Solutions Engineering team, it’s your goal to design the prospect’s end-state solution together with the prospect. You will be part of the Solutions Engineering team (Sales) in which you will fulfill a leading role only gained by excellent performance. Talking technical details as well as discussing general business outcomes, you comfortably translate requirements into distinguished architecture design. 
 Whether you talk to the board of directors, the marketing team or the IT department, you turn every red light green. You love to travel and stay abroad. We work on a global scale, so if you don’t already own a platinum flying card, you will within a year. 
 You will join prospects in their exploration of Backbase products. As an all-round product expert, you navigate through the full sales cycle, from doing technology deep dives and leading proof of concepts, to leading workshops and generating feedback. Your performance blows each prospect of its feet. And we do need a little extra more. 
 When we mention a getting-things-done mentality, you immediately recognize yourself. Not only do you feel comfortable talking business, you’re also a congenial companion during coffee breaks. And let’s not forget your organizing skills. Those skills, by the way, also come in handy when planning leisure time, because if we send you to the other end of the world and overload you with work, we do understand that you might want to loosen up afterward and explore the surroundings. 
 You will join a highly motivated global team with like-minded people that are spread across the globe. Currently our team is spread across Amsterdam, London, New York, New Jersey, Atlanta, Toronto, Singapore, Tokyo and Sydney.  apply now

 BACKBASE IN PRINCETON 
  __Princeton 
 We added the Princeton office to the list of Backbase hubs in the summer of 2019. While the red paint is drying on the walls, we’ve already started looking for new colleagues to join our third North-American hub. 
 Based in a prime location in Carnegie Center, halfway between New York and Philadelphia, our office is easily accessible by car, railway or bus. We’re located in a great “work and play” office park with lots of cool amenities. Unwind after a busy workday with a basketball game at one of the two basketball courts, or form a team and compete in the summer sand volleyball league. Or do you prefer a game of bocce, lunchtime walks or jogging instead? Your call. 
 #musicfans! 
 CULTURE 
 We love music and entertainment - fact! Staying true to that, we named our conference rooms after famous singers like Sinatra, Tupac and Biggie. More fun to come as we continue to grow our team in New Jersey.
