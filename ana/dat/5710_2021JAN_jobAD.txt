 You're going to work on our booking platform. A keen eye for UI/UX details is big plus. 
 Role overview 
 Currently, we have a position available for a senior front-end engineer. As a growing, late-stage startup, we look for self-starters who thrive in a fast-paced, agile environment which means wearing many hats, being able to change direction quickly, and showing an eagerness to learn new technologies as the need arises. In this role, you'll work with a small, collaborative team of engineers, product managers, and designers so excellent interpersonal and communication skills are also a must. Most importantly, we look for people who can prioritize, multi-task, and deliver because it’s a lot more fun to get things done. 
 You're a great candidate if you have: 
 
 Proficiency with HTML5, CSS3 and TypeScript. 
 Experience with React and Node in high-volume, production systems (React-Native is a nice-to-have). 
 Experience with Webpack. 
 Experience with SSR, Redux or Mobx. 
 Continual learning of emerging technologies/industry trends. 
 Excellent communication skills and experience in collaborative environments. 
 Experience building mobile applications that utilize web-services (either HTTP based, XML-RPC, JSON or other services) and experience with Agile software development is a plus. 
 A keen eye for UI/UX details

Collectively, we’ve traveled to over 80 countries and know what matters most - creating an authentic experience. We believe the best travel accommodations are all about delivering an exceptional, unique stay and far too often property managers and hosts fall short on delivering a first-class short-term rental experience.

We came together to build a revolutionary hospitality brand through the power of virtual tech automation in the short-term rental market. With offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles, we currently operate in 7 markets across the United States.
