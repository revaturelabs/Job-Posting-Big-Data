The Bottom of a Bottle 
 Trust me, I've been there, I've looked, I've searched and I know now, that there are no answers to be found in the bottom of a bottle or on the edge of a blade! Fighting Hard, Recovering, Rebuilding, REBORN. Moving on from addiction to a new life.

 Rains Fall – Job 36:27-32 
 The rain will fall 
 The water’s of heaven 
 Abundant showers 
 To wash all mankind 
 To the skies we look 
 To the skies we cry 
 Fall upon us Lord 
 Water’s to wash our soul 
 We cry out to the One 
 Who master’s the clouds 
 Commands lighting to strike 
 The One who can make 
 The abundant rain fall 
 To the skies we look 
 To the skies we cry 
 Let it rain 
 Let it rain 
 
 Job 36:27-32
