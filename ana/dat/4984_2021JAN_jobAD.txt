  3 Career Development Tips That Will Get You Ahead Of The Competition  
 Leona Sharon 
 November 16, 2016 
 Whether you are on the verge of graduating or you have other plans to join (or re-join) the workforce, you need to look for ways to efficiently and effectively develop as a professional. You have to continually improve your strengths and/or your weaknesses, build good rapport with your co-workers and bosses, and be able to prove your worth to be the best employee you can be.  Related:   3 Steps To Create Your Own Career Development Plan  New employees can sometimes be confused when trying to identify the right steps to take. Some end up in choosing the wrong job, and this creates obstructions in an otherwise bright career path. Here are three career development tips that can help you achieve success with absolute confidence. 
 
 1. Polish Your Curriculum Vitae (CV) 
 A well-formatted CV is the ideal way to let your employers recognize your educational qualifications, work experiences and skills. You need to constantly revise it to keep potential employers up-to-date about your accomplishments. It’s very important to design a CV properly, since it also plays a key role in making the first impression on people you haven't met. Remember, in today’s job market, you need to represent yourself in such a manner that your future employers are convinced they should hire you without having a single doubt. A legible and reader-friendly CV can work wonders for your career, especially if it highlights what makes you an employee that does more than the minimum required. 
 2. Be Certain Of Your Career Goals 
 Distraction is a word you must wipe out of your career dictionary to achieve success. There are people who initially aim to equip themselves for their dream jobs. However, because of outside circumstances, their dream doesn’t get fulfilled. You need to be the exception in this respect. If you have always dreamt of having a specific job, give your heart and soul to get it. Keep yourself updated on the news and developments within your industry. Never stop researching the employers who are hiring people for your position. Even if you have your own business, try finding out how others are performing in the same field. This would surely keep you informed of your competitors, which in turn would help you adopt strategies for staying ahead of them. 
 3. Look For Opportunities That Can Let You Lead 
 The more you accumulate experience at work, the easier it becomes to master leadership qualities. However, if you are new at work, you can’t expect to become a leader within a couple of months. This is a reason why graduates opt for career development courses like MBA's to qualify for managerial positions later. Enroll in a course that can play a vital role in heightening your career prospects. If you are working and have no time to enroll in a full-time course, you can look for  accredited online university courses . In fact, pursuing an online course will help you apply your course-based knowledge to your existing work, which will later help you lead in a top-notch organization. There are other strategies that you can adopt for career development. However, the ones mentioned above are no doubt crucial and effective. If you keep them in mind, no one can stop you from achieving a bright future. That’s a promise!!  This post was originally published on an earlier date.  Photo Credit:  Shutterstock
