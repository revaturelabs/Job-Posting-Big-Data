 I am third year nursing student and have related learning experiences in various aspects of nursing care in hospitals and nursing homes during the course of our studies. I enjoy taking care of elderly individuals because I also learn a lot from them. They give me different perspectives in life so that I learn to be responsible, dedicated and hardworking person. I would be very much willing to prove my worth and hope you will give me a chance.

 Francis Pascual, 
 At present, the Canadian Agency for the said Live in Caregiver Jobs do not accept Live-in Caregiver applications directly from the Philippines because the processing times are too long. But you can always apply for a POEA approved caregiver jobs in Canada wherein the recruiting agency will be the one who will handle all the paperworks. And currently, there is a POEA approved job order for Caregiver Work in Canada. The job order was approved by the POEA last December 1, 2009 for a recruitment agency based in Malate Manila. For more info, you can refer to my article titled POEA Caregiver Work in Canada which can be found on the same website Caregiver Work Abroad. 
 Thanks for visiting Caregiver Work Abroad.

 I am 54years old, physically and mentally healthy. I loved working abroad as caregiver. Could it be possible to work abroad with my age? I took up certification from TESDA Phils. 
 Appreciate your quick response. 
 Best, 
susan
