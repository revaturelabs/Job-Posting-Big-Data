  Why It's Important To Have A Career Plan

 July 14, 2020 
 Almost everyone has some sort of significant goal or aspiration they hope to achieve in the future. For a lot of people, this includes some type of long-term career plan or dream job that they would like to obtain. 
 While these major objectives may seem difficult or even impossible to achieve, they can appear much more manageable through the use of a career plan. The future can provide an extremely uncertain ride, but having a solid career plan in place can serve as a reliable roadmap to get you wherever you would like to go. Here are three reasons why you should have a solid career plan. 
 
 Career Planning Helps Us Grow 
 Having a realistic career plan in place is often an essential part of career growth, and our personal growth and development. Without goals to strive for, most people find it difficult to stray from the easy norm or to gain skills which make them a more valuable commodity in the business world. 
 If your career isn't growing, it's dying!  Failing to put together a career plan that will help you grow professional could lead to a  career crisis. 
 By planning for the future and setting a specific timeline for accomplishing the things you want to achieve, you will find that your career plan is an effective way to ensure you never lose motivation along the way . Between the accountability of having fixed objectives and the inspiration you'll receive when you attain you career growth goals, your career plan is an opportunity to maximize your true potential. 
 It'll Help You Land Your Dream Job 
 If one of the important destinations in your future is a much-desired job or position, a career plan truly is a roadmap to help you reach it. Job boards are full of available positions, but often the most desired and competitive dream jobs require a significant amount of prerequisite experience or education. It's very rare that someone will simply fall into their dream job. 
 Most commonly,  it takes years of planning your career growth, hard work, and even a little bit of luck to develop your current situation into the career of your dreams.  By isolating exactly  what you'll need to accomplish  in order to be a candidate for the job you truly want, fulfilling the needed tasks will become much easier and your chances of success are much higher. 
 A Career Plan Is Essential To Planning Your Retirement 
 Having a realistic career plan in place is not just about work. In fact, a great career plan should have a much longer view. Unless your dream job is something that you want to do every single day of your life, your career plan can also be used to determine the steps needed to smoothly enter into retirement down the road. By incorporating a rudimentary knowledge of financial planning into your career goals and setting yourself up for retirement through proper savings and the allocation of investments will serve as a great way to wrap up your long-term career plan. 
 Working in your dream job may be where you would like to see yourself in ten years, but what about when you're in your 60s or 70s? 
 Career planning may intimidate some people who are unsure about the direction they would like to take decades down the road. Instead of being a set-in-stone list of rules and objectives you must follow, your career plan should instead be viewed as simply a way to get what you want. As frequently as our wants and needs change, the tasks we must accomplish in order to achieve them change just as fast.  Having a career plan  can help you design your future the way you would like it, but can also be flexible enough to change when your personal ambitions and goals do.
