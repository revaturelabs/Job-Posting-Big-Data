 Posted by  lisalazuli

 ARIES HOROSCOPE 2018  - Now BIGGER, BETTER and more DETAILED than before. 
 " Aries are not a ballistic missile; this year, you, are a cruise missile, powerful, guided, and targeted. You are also a MOAB; ready to make a major impression and impose yourself on a situation to ensure you prevail. 
While Aries are often good at initiating, you guys are not always great at keeping the momentum going and ramming home an advantage, but in 2018, you are able to keep that speed up, keep jumping over the hurdles and making sure you build on efforts and ensure that projects grow and develop. 
You are quite formidable and will be a force to be reckoned with – anyone who underestimates you does so at their peril. 
Aries are very sensual regarding love and more able to express yourself in an amorous and patient way; your stamina is improved, and you will spend more time to get what you want from love. While the air signs are the ones that may get you randy, it is the earth signs that can really do it for yo 
 u in the sac. 
 Monthly horoscopes with yearly overview: 
Life 
Love 
Health 
Career
