 Transitional ‘Light’ Duty Jobs: What Are They and Do I Have to Take One? 
 Posted on June 2, 2014 by   Brody Ockander 
 
 When injured at work, your doctor may give you work restrictions that prevent you from returning to your regular job. In these situations, there are three things your employer can do: 
 
 Tell you that they have no jobs within your restrictions 
 Give you a transitional duty (or "light duty") job within your restrictions 
 Force you to work your regular job in violation of your restrictions 
 
 If it's #3, call a lawyer immediately and inform your doctor that your employer is not following the doctor's orders. 
 If it's #1, you would be taken off work and you would be entitled to workers' compensation benefits for temporary disability until you are released back to work or until your employer accommodates your work restrictions. 
 If it's #2, it not always clear what the result will be. This "transitional duty" option is when your employer returns you to work but not at your normal job. Instead you are given a different, temporary job while you are on restrictions. 
 Problems arise with these transitional jobs when your hours are cut, your pay is cut, or you are asked to do a job that is unreasonable. Often, if you refuse to work a transitional duty job that is in your restrictions, you could forfeit your right to obtain work comp payments for temporary disability while you are on those restrictions and off work. 
 If the transitional duty job that is offered to you cuts your hours, you will probably be entitled to temporary disability payments in an amount to make up (somewhat) for the difference in what you were making before the incident that caused the injury and what you are now making in your transitional job. 
 Similarly, if your hourly rate or your wages for your transitional job are less than what you would have been earning before you were injured, you would again be entitled to temporary disability payments in an attempt to make up for the shortfall. 
 Where transitional duty jobs have a gray area is whether they are truly reasonable jobs that are being offered. For example, there are horror stories of employees working in the near dark for 8 hours per day or working in appalling conditions sorting paperclips for transitional duty. Whether or not you have to take a job like these horror stories without forfeiting your right to temporary disability payments depends on the facts of each specific case. 
 Click the link - it's about a Walmart guy who had to do "light duty" in the bathroom for 7 hours a day:  http://www.aol.com/article/2014/05/27/wal-mart-employee-claims-he-was-forced-to-spend-7-hour-shift-in/20893585/?icid=maing-grid7%7Chtmlws-main-bb%7Cdl28%7Csec1_lnk3%26pLid%3D481058 
 Generally speaking, however, if you are offered a transitional job within your restrictions, you should probably take that job unless you have a very good reason that you cannot. For example, in at least one Nebraska case, the court held that even having an employee relocate 300 miles for a temporary transitional job was considered a reasonable job offer. Even transitional jobs that are during different shifts than your normal shift may be considered reasonable. If a job is reasonable and you do not have a good reason for not accepting such a transitional job, you could be denied temporary benefits and be left without any pay at all while attempting to recover from your work injury. 
 If you have a job that sounds unreasonable, and you are contemplating whether or not you are required to accept such a job, contact a lawyer. An experienced lawyer will be able to give you a good idea of whether turning down such a job would allow your employer to deny you temporary disability payments or not.
