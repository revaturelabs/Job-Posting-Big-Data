 You have the courage to learn and to share your learning process with us
More about this opening 
 Working on the Showcase application gives me the opportunity to create features that even the biggest of banks have yet to implement, which makes me feel like I’m working half a decade in the future. Seeing the hard work displayed on the big screen during the keynote of the annual Connect conference was truly the icing on the cake. 
 George Coleman iOS Engineer, EMEA Hub 
 It really makes me feel happy being part of a team that's building high quality web and mobile applications for the very complex world of Banking industry. Besides, your ideas and initiatives are heard and considered by your team colleagues. 
 Alejandro Aguirre Luna Senior Backend Engineer, EMEA Hub 
 The most exciting thing about working at Backbase is the multicultural environment, very zealous co-workers, freedom to challenge yourself. The key essence of working at Backbase is the constant strive to make it happen, gather all the pieces of the puzzle and make a beautiful picture out of it and that is what I love most about working at Backbase.

 THE JOB AT BACKBASE 
 As a Field Enablement Manager, you will drive and deliver in-person / online training and coaching programs that enable all members of a project team except the developers. You can think of Project Managers, Delivery Directors, Customer Success Managers and many more. 
You educate and coach the teams to understand and pitch the Backbase Platform and all it’s capabilities, in all the different go-to-market configurations and value propositions, for all the regions. You design always-on, continuous learning programs that on-goingly impact the productivity and effectiveness of our sales teams. Through standardising certification, you create all the fundamentals to consistently deliver A-Players. 
 You are someone who thinks strategically but executes with fine precision - part experienced sales leader, part solution engineer, part program owner and part coach. 
Key Responsibilities: 
 
 
 __Stakeholder Management - You have exceptional relationship building skills and partner with the CS Vice Presidents, Directors, Managers and representatives to drive a prioritized global and regional enablement plan. You are part of a relatively new team that loves to brainstorm and partner with CS, Sales Operations, Product Marketing and Strategy to curate and deliver high-quality content for your enablement program. 
 
 
 __Program Management - You create and deliver scalable enablement plans and initiatives that should currently enable almost 400 people all over the world. You plan the execution throughout the year, fully owning the enablement calendar per region. You drive a cadence of quarterly, monthly, continuously learning and coaching activities. Even though the program needs to be scalable you need to address the specific needs per role. 
 
 
 __Learning Journey Content Owner - You are not afraid to get your hands dirty and can personally drive the creation of learning journeys that are engaging and ensure sales will complete the learning courses with the expected outcome. The content will drive the enablement of the sales leaders within the regions to ensure they are skilled to coach their own people, reinforcing learning and best practices 
 
 
 __Training & Coaching - You run the delivery and execution of training and coaching programs using online learning systems, in-person workshops and other content delivery platforms. You’re smart about which tools to use for which purpose, while never forgetting the need for scalability. This is why having a background in complex IT projects will come in handy. 
 
 
 __Monitor Performance - You assess and measure the ability of our sales force to execute against standards of performance through online and face-to-face validation and certification exercises. It is your responsibility to create A-Players and give transparent feedback to our sales teams and their leadership. 
 
 
 __Voice of the Field - You serve as a strong feedback mechanism from the field back to various teams within Backbase. You identify gapps affiliated with Field Enablement and work with the necessary resources to address those needs.
