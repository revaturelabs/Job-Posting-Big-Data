 " I was feeling very lost and unsure of where I was going. I was having an identity crisis! For the first time in my life, I feel like I can say I understand who I am and the path I'm looking to take. " Becca, Marketing Director 
 **" You were able to spot the gaps in my answers and dig deeper; getting me to open up my thinking which ultimately gave me complete clarity. I thought I wanted one thing however the reality is that I don't right now. ** If you are looking for clarity then you are the person that Jo would be able to help and support.   My first piece of advice is if you are thinking of doing it don 't spend 3 months 'thinking' about it like I did.   "   Lorna, Head Of Learning & Development
