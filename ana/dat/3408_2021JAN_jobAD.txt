 95% of New Jobs under Obama Were Temporary 
 During his farewell press conference, President Obama claimed  that, "Since I signed Obamacare into law (in 2010), our businesses have added more than 15 million new jobs.” 
 Reality check, Mr. Lame Duck President.  Only 10 million new jobs were created during your eight years in office and 94% of them were TEMPORARY POSITIONS. 
 The disappearance of conventional full-time work  has punished every demographic, but FEMALE-dominated jobs -- like education and medicine -- were particularly hard hit.

 They also categorized flipping burgers at mcDonald's as "manufacturing jobs."His labor figures,like his whole miserable life is one big sham.

   Verse of the day 
 
 Philippians 2:14-16 
 
 
 
 “Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.” Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.”
