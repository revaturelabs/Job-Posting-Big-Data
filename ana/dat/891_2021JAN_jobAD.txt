 Campground Job Advice 
 - a Workers On Wheels website reader asks... 
(How To Not Waste Time and Fuel Money) 
 I believe the advice (about going to a campground first, before accepting a job there) is good, but wouldn't that require two trips to the campground? We want to experience different campgrounds in hosting and in visiting new areas. 
 Wouldn't visiting it first require double mileage and added time, and therefore, expense? We know we take a chance that way, but I don't see another way without doing two trips. 
 Coleen, the RVing editor comments: 
 Following the method that we suggest for finding campground jobs only requires that you go to the campground one time. In fact, the reason we recommend it is because it mostly eliminates wasted travel time and wasted fuel. It also leads to less disappointment and frustration. 
 When following the method that we suggest, once you accept the job offer, you stay right there. You start work right away. You don't go away and return to start the job at a later date. You just stay at the campground and do it, and move after you are finished. 
 You can find the complete article on what we recommend doing to find your dream job on our website. If you  click here , it will take you to the page with the article  Find a Campground Job: Here's the Secret for Finding a Workamper Job You'll Love .

 Workers On Wheels is our website and newsletter about working while RVing -- working while living in a home on wheels. There are so many kinds of work to do while RVing and camping (what some campers call workcamping or work camping). We help RV workers -- whether snowbirds or full-time RVers -- find campground jobs, volunteer jobs, jobs with RV spaces, seasonal jobs, mobile employment, short-term paid employment, and other ways to earn an income and cut expenses while enjoying life in a recreational vehicle. Thanks for visiting our WOW website! ~ Jim, your Workers On Wheels editor, at work-for-RVers-and-campers.com
