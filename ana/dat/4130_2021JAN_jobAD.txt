 Greater Norristown PAL To Hold First Job Fair June 24 
 
 Map of Pennsylvania highlighting Montgomery County (Photo credit: Wikipedia) 
 NORRISTOWN, PA — It’s not every job fair organizer that offers to hook up applicants with a necktie if he needs one, but Ken Fennal is passionate about making Greater  Norristown  PAL’s first open job fair a success for all concerned. 
 And that extends to making sure every male applicant who shows up is dressed to impress. 
 “If someone needs a tie they should contact me and I’ll provide them with a tie myself,” said Fennal, PAL’s program director. “Men should at least wear a tie, if not a suit or sport jacket. First impressions can make the difference in getting a second interview or being hired on the spot, versus another candidate who may have the same level of skills but may not be dressed appropriately. We know the difference in going to an interview dressed well or wearing something casual, but a young person may not know that. We want to emphasize that they should be prepared properly when they come in the door, so I think not only is it appropriate to have a dress code, social standards dictate that you should be dressed a certain way for certain professions.”

 Mohegan Job Fair Draws Thousands Seeking Casino Posts 
 
 Map of Pennsylvania highlighting Luzerne County (Photo credit: Wikipedia) 
 Editor 's note: We got quite a few hits after posting an article about this job fair. We are not surprised by the large turnout. It's certainly an employers market. 
 PLAINS TWP. — Students, working parents, the unemployed. 
 About 2,000 people from across  Northeastern Pennsylvania  filed through the  Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs  ballroom during a job fair Tuesday, having come to try their luck at an estimated 250 openings expected to be created by the opening of a $50 million hotel and convention center this fall. 
 If there was a common denominator throughout the crowd — whose attire ranged from business suits to shorts, T-shirts and flip-flops — it was the oft-spoken view that a job at Mohegan Sun, which already employs more than 1,700 people, means good, steady work.

 Mohegan Sun Pocono Downs Plans June 18 Job Fair - Needs To Fill 250 Positions 
 
 Map of Pennsylvania highlighting Luzerne County (Photo credit: Wikipedia) 
 PLAINS TOWNSHIP — With regional unemployment above 9 percent, a job fair in five weeks to fill 250 positions at  Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs ’ soon-to-open hotel/convention center is likely to draw thousands. 
 Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs Assistant General Manager Kara Fox-LaRose on Wednesday said rather than just inviting job seekers to send in resumes or applications, the venue will hold an on-site job fair 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. June 18. Interviews will take place in July and the staff will be hired throughout the summer to be trained, she said. 
 The $50 million hotel and convention center will have seven floors, 238 hotel rooms, a bistro, a 4,150-square-foot Spa Sapphire, an indoor pool and fitness center and the 20,000-square-foot convention center able to seat 850 people for dinners and other events. It also will be able to hold entertainment events for 1,500 people. 
 Its targeted opening date is Oct. 1. It will be the largest hotel in  Luzerne County  and will give the casino the ability to attract customers from farther distances.
