 Mitt Romney Adviser Says Jeep Jobs Added In China Are Jobs Not Added In U.S. 
 Oct 31 
 Posted by  Old Boy 
 WASHINGTON - When  Mitt Romney  told a crowd in Ohio last week that he had read a report saying  Jeep  was "thinking of moving all production to [China](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=39.9166666667,116.383333333&spn=10.0,10.0&q=39.9166666667,116.383333333 (China)&t=h "China")," there was at least a potentially defensible explanation. 
 A Bloomberg story published the previous Monday had stated that Fiat, which owns  Chrysler , "plans to return Jeep output to China and may eventually make all of its models in that country." 
 A line was added to the Bloomberg story after it was published stating that  Mike Manley , chief operating officer of Fiat and Chrysler in Asia, was referring to "adding Jeep production sites rather than shifting output from North [America](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.8833333333,-77.0166666667&spn=10.0,10.0&q=38.8833333333,-77.0166666667 (United%20States)&t=h "United States") to China." The  Romney campaign  told  The Huffington Post  on Tuesday that the update was after Romney made his remark on Thursday. It's not clear whether that's true or not, but what is known is that Chrysler refuted press reports about the Bloomberg story before Romney spoke Thursday evening in Defiance, Ohio. 
 What has confounded many political observers, and provoked a spirited counteroffensive from the Obama campaign -- including their own TV ad -- is why the Romney campaign then aired in Ohio a  TV commercial  that implied the auto bailout had hurt the auto industry and that Chrysler was sending U.S. jobs to China. Chrysler told  HuffPost  the company has added 11,200 U.S. jobs since going through a managed bankruptcy backed by federal bailout dollars in late 2008 and early 2009. And while Chrysler is going to make Jeeps in China for the Chinese market rather than selling U.S.-built models in China, the company said it is expanding production rather than shifting it, adding shifts and hiring workers in the U.S. at the same time.
