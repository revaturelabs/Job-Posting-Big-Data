 My job 
 Posted by  sunniesmybunnies  on  May 30, 2020May 30, 2020 
 Me with Sparsh and Anaya 
 It is my job to teach you, 
To tell you what to see, 
To pass on all the things to know 
To live life successfully. 
 It is my job to make you strong? 
Courageous, smart and tough? 
And what if I am not these things? 
Will I be enough? 
 What if all I have are arms 
To hold you when you’re tired 
Ears to listen,eyes to see 
You as you are, will I be fired? 
 I don’t know, but time will tell, 
Values good or bad will spell. 
Don’t be good, just be nice, 
You two, my treasured prize. 
~ 
 Nidhi
