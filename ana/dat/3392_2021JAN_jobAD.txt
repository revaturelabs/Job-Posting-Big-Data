 Male voice only.

 Decent audio recordings are necessary, phone quality is not acceptable. 
The person should play with the voice according to what's happening in the video, not just boring dubbing. 
 Some help with translation would be needed as well.

 Youtube videos for kids voice acting 
 Published: Last month  Bids: 5 
 Hello! 
 I need professional translators and voice actors for YouTube «For Kids» category videos. It'll be perfect if you can translate text from Russian to English and then vocalize videos all by yourself. I need male's voice for a father and preferrably female's or kid's voice to vocalize kid's phrases. 
The kid is 6 years old. Vocalization quality needs to be perfect, I want it to be emotional and contain no extraneous noises. Videos theme is «Pretend Play» and average video duration is 3 minutes with each containing 10-15 phrases. 
 I expect translations and vocalizations to be ready in approximately 2 days and I'm ready to pay around $10 for each one. 
 If everything will be fine, we can have long-term work relationship. 
 Best regards, 
Eugene
