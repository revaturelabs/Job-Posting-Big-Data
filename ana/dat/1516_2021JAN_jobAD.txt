 Why I love my job 
 
 
 Senior Software Engineer 
 I love my job at Workiva! Every day, I’m writing code to solve difficult problems that real customers are facing. I’m surrounded by very talented people in a fantastic work environment. 
 
 
 
 Software Engineer 
 It was an easy decision to join Workiva when I saw how passionate everyone is about empathizing with our customers and their needs. My coworkers have made it easy to stay because of our environment of lifting each other up, where you can ask questions without feeling intimidated or looked down on. You have plenty of growth opportunities, whether your focus is mostly coding or if you’re involved in employee resource groups.
