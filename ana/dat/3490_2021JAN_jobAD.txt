 How to handle referral so more keep coming 
   
 An #engineer refers his friend to a #hiring #manager. After the initial exchange, the engineer never hears back from the hiring manager about his friend. 
 An engineer writes a post on #LinkedIn telling his connections about an opening at his company. He gets many #resumes. After #screening through those resumes, he passes 3 good resumes to a hiring manager. He receives a thank you note from the hiring manager. He never hears back from the hiring manager about those resumes. 
 In both of these situations, the manager is almost guaranteed to never receive another referral. The manager simply does not know how to treat a referral well. 
 Most companies have a referral bonus. It’s a mistake that a hiring manager makes by leaving the #referral to the company’s system. If a hiring manager does this, he’s lack of some basic communication skill. 
 So how should a manager treat a referral right so that he continues to get high quality leads? 
 There are many ways to treat a referral right. Some managers take great care of referrals by sending gifts, hand-written thank-you cards, taking them out for a meal…. 
 However, a simple message to tell people who refer to you about how their referral did is sufficient.

 If you want to get a job, never speak ill of your manager 
   
 Two engineers (Tina and Steve) go to an interview. Both work for the same manager. 
 The hiring manager: “Tell me about your manager, especially what you don’t like about him.” 
 Steve: “Hmm, I don’t know what to tell you. He’s the reason I am looking for a new job. He’s a micromanager at his best. He tells people what to do and when people can’t satisfy him, he does everything to kick them out. He manipulates people by using his power as a manager. He’s very good at kissing up and kicking down. His boss loves him. None of my co-workers like him. They are all looking secretly. The only reason people stay with him is because they have not found another job yet. He draws blood out of us like a vampire and throws us away like trash when he no longer needs us.” 
 Tina: “I love my manager. Even though he’s not a role model for me, I learn very valuable lessons from him. I learn a great deal of what not to do as a great manager. These types of lessons are not easily available and my manager happens to be very good at teaching me that. So I am grateful for his existence in my life.” 
 Tina gets the job and Steve keeps looking. 
 Be positive. Be humble. Any situation no matter how bad or good it is can give you valuable lessons. 
 And in an interview or to be successful in your career, never speak ill of your boss.
