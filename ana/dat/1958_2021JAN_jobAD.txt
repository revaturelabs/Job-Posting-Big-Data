 Todays Fun! Applying for jobs of Glassdoor 
 This is what it looks like when I looking at potential job positions on glassdoor.com. 
 
 Glassdoor uses an iFrame (yuck) to pull in jobs from various sites: 
 
 For whatever reasons the iFrame today is set to 300×150 pixels… 
 I used the chrome developers tools to set the iframe to 1024×768 so that I could apply for the jobs i was interested in.. 
 
 This kind of sloppiness drives me nuts and it seems to highlight my experience with applying for jobs online. I am surprised by the lack of quality control. Sending this to glassdoor.com so they are aware of what is happening. 
 Running: Chrome Version 44.0.2403.155 (64-bit) - OS X 10.10.5
