 ℹ️ About the Project: 
 Our vision is to empower more entrepreneurs to create viable businesses, enabling them to work on something they are passionate about whilst having a positive impact on the world. 
 The   biggest reason   startups fail is because their business model is unviable, and despite the plethora of online resources for startups, they do little to help solve this problem. 
 Enter - BizNest. 
 We're on a mission to solve this problem by creating an online platform where founders can validate new business ideas in one central location. This is achieved by combining an innovation workflow (SaaS) with a Marketplace to provide bespoke support to entrepreneurs. 
 Essentially, we are replicating the main benefits offered by a business incubator but online. 
 The SaaS element will require you to have some working knowledge of Lean Startup and/or Customer Development. If these things mean nothing to you then this role is not for you, sorry! 
 **👥 About the Team: 
**🇬🇧 Mark 
(CEO / Business Development / Finance) 
Based in London, England. 
I have 8 years experience in project management, strategic partnerships and business development. 
I helped the last company I worked with grow from £25m to a £430m acquisition in 3 years. 
I'm a big-hearted chap who enjoys travel, hiking, tennis and entrepreneurship. 
 🇷🇴 Lavinius 
(CPO / Product Management / Marketing) 
Based in London, England. 
A product manager who fixates on the 'why' before executing the 'how and the 'what'. 
I have founded several businesses, one of which recently got listed on the Romanian stock exchange. 
We also have 2 junior developers and a technical advisor who are helping to build the MVP. This is being done with Google Firebase + React JS. 
 **📈 Progress so far: 
** To date, we have undertaken extensive research and validation of this problem including: 
 
 
 Testing 2 prototypes 
 
 
 Taken several payments to demonstrate proof of concept 
 
 
 Over 100 organic sign ups via the landing page 
 
 
 Over 40 customer interviews 
 
 
 The feedback from the most recent prototype has been positive, so we are now moving from prototype to MVP stage, and also beginning to ramp up marketing operations. 
 🤩 Who we 're looking for: 
 A lot of the success of this product relies on creating a great user experience. Along with the usual bits, we are also looking for someone who intimately understands the problem we aim to solve. This will entail having direct experience working with accelerators and/or attempting to build multiple startups in an early-stage role. 
 Essential experience 
 
 
 Capable of leading all UX/UI elements on a project to include user research, testing, persona creation, prototyping, interaction and interface design etc... 
 
 
 Experience working in an accelerator environment, mentoring early-stage startups, or building startups from ideation/prototype stages. 
 
 
 Ability to build and manage the design team. 
 
 
 Motivation, capacity and hustle to be a key member of a founding team and help to grow a thriving business to a £250m + valuation 
 
 
 Nice-to-haves 
 
 
 Brand creation and identity 
 
 
 Experience developing SaaS and/or Marketplace products 
 
 
 Experience in gamification 
 
 
 We believe it's a very exciting time to build this product, the COVID pandemic has only accelerated the need for this product and if executed well, the market potential is huge. 
 Please note that as we are a bootstrapped startup, this is currently an   equity-only role . Due to this, we are happy with applicants who can hustle on this project in their spare time. There will be an option to draw down a small salary after raising our first investment round, which should be in Q2, 2021. 
 This project is truly collaborative and you will get a significant equity stake in the business, along with a lot of control in helping us to steer the direction of the company. 
 Thanks for reading!
