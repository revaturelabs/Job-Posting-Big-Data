 Before I Tripped Over a Stone, #23

 Before I Tripped Over a Stone, Fridays, #19 
   
 (Previous series post, Before I Tripped, #18) The beginning of my illustrious career bartending, waitressing and short-order cooking. In this bar, we usually had a bartender and a waitress. We knew all positions, worked them all and were kept very busy! I was training in on a Sunday night. Sunday nights were slower but still...  Continue Reading ->

 Before I Tripped Over a Stone, Fridays, #18 
   
 (Previous series post, Before I Tripped, #17) I had successfully passed my commercial driving test with air brake, and passenger endorsements after my county job had come to a close. I enjoyed driving a school bus. Route driving was pretty easy. We were paid for a minimum of two hours no matter how long our...  Continue Reading ->

You can kiss your hours' goodbye for today, and if you ever speak to me like that again you will be off my crew faster than you can blink, do you hear me?" "Yeah." "What did you say?" "Yes,...

 Before I Tripped Over a Stone, Fridays. #16 
   
 (Previous series post, Before I Tripped, #15) As a whole, 'ghost children' freak me out. I don't find them scary, necessarily, but they are a bit intrusive!
