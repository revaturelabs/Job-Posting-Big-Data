 Job Searching Prior to Graduation -- A Preemptive Strike, or a Naive Blunder? 
 April 24, 2019August 21, 2019 
 I'm rolling up my sleeves to begin my next job search. The process is in equal part exciting and exhausting. How do I avoid leaving my current employers in the lurch? When do I tell them I'm planning to depart-do I even know if I WILL depart? How long is the interview process for my dream job? How do I tailor my resumes and cover letters to suit prospective employers? Before getting  too  ahead of myself, what is the interview process even like, and how should I prepare for it? And what's a diversity statement anyway??? 
 Transitioning to the world of higher education from student to faculty is a truly daunting process, and while I stew about how to press forward, I can't help getting caught in a web of doubt, uncertainty, and a strong dose of Imposter Syndrome. It's especially tricky when I live within ten miles of two accredited universities churning out future information professionals like me. It's a tight market in Michigan, and a long shot to apply for a well-paid position out of state, even if it's an entry level position. 
 I'm determined to give this next stage of professional development my absolute all…I've worked hard to get where I am today (as evidenced by my notable absence from this blog-Earning Magna Cum Laude status as a Grad student required my full attention!) 
 I suppose time will tell how my personal journey unfolds as I rapidly approach graduation in Fall 2019. If I can get a job lined up by then, I think I'll be in good shape! 
 If you're an Information Science student that's in a similar position; trying to balance your focus in finalizing your education, appeasing your current employers, and tying your shoelaces to join the job-searching rat race, here are some articles I found useful in my initial research for the pre-graduate job hunt:
