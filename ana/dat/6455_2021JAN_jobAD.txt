 More about this opening 
 In Backbase, I learn something new every single day. Working on Service SDK is challenging but exciting at the same time. Backbase is definitely a place to be if you want to constantly evolve and grow as a professional. 
 Allie Ward Senior QA Engineer, UK Hub 
 I'm a huge fan of diversity at Backbase. I love the freedom and ownership opportunities at work. I'm proud of the new solution that we are building. We had a simple idea and the solution that I've proposed is the one that we are working on. 
 Hari Vignesh Android Engineer, EMEA Hub 
 What excites me most about working at Backbase is understanding the diverse needs of our customers and working with the team to solve them within the real-world constraints. 
 Grace Brady Product Owner, EMEA Hub 
 Call me crazy but I love my job. I get paid to work on puzzles with my friends, play pool and learn new tech. 
 Patrick Newcombe Senior Full Stack Engineer, UK Hub 
 The biggest challenge I overcame with my team was creating an entirely new mobile product from scratch, aligning an entirely new team with people from very different backgrounds and creating a way of working which has the DNA of Backbase in it. 
 Harneek Singh Senior QA Engineer, EMEA Hub 
 Bringing a mobile-first approach to an industry with brick and mortar companies is not about the solutions or products you deliver but about that mentor-mentee relationship you develop with them along the way. 
 Tibor Beke Android Engineer, EMEA Hub

 trust me, 
 it's my job 
 THE JOB AT BACKBASE 
 By the end of month 1:  You’ve completed your Backbase onboarding; connecting and participating with new starters around the globe in week 1. You’ve started to build your product and domain knowledge by shadowing the Domain Architect, running our software and better understanding our solutions and challenges. Started to develop your Architect’s network across the organisation. 
 By the end of month 3:  Having participated in sessions with our customers, you are translating their needs into a set of technical designs that are building on your newly gained IAM subject matter expertise - supported by the Domain Architect. You have worked closely with the Engineering Teams to help them convert these into a meaningful set of roadmap items; leveraging or extending open-standards and protocols where possible. You have guided the Product Owners to help them be considerate of the non-functional requirements when shaping their backlog. 
 By the end of month 6:  As part of your engagement in the wider Backbase Architect’s community, you are helping shape the technical roadmap with the Engineering Team’s Tech Leads; working with the Product Owners to ensure we’re investing back into creating a secure, scalable and resilient platform. It’s likely the first fruits of your labour are hitting our distro repositories and our customers are beginning to ‘kick the tyres’ by running it on our Backbase-as-a-Sevice Cloud platform. You’re keen to ensure this lands properly, so you’re spending time with our Ops team to review the operational metrics. 
 By the end of month 12:  your first product is live for our customers and you’ve already driven at least one significant technical improvement across our products. You’ve signed up for the next big IAM or Tech conference and can’t wait to share your new knowledge in the next lunch-and-learn session. 
 The technology 
A Cloud-native, Microservices Architecture underpins our Backend services and exposes our RESTful APIs. Our containerised applications are managed by Kubernetes on our Backbase-as-a-Service cloud offering, or at our customers’ private Cloud. 
We are big adopters of open-source frameworks and libraries. When suitable, we choose to use and contribute to open-source applications and platforms to get to value quicker and leverage the community expertise. 
On the web we’re running Angular and we deliver iOS and Android applications and components.  apply now
