 “Nudge nudge, know what I mean, say no more” ~  Eric Idle 
 A wonderland/Python kind of day. Spent the afternoon on campus waiting for Brett and then spent the evening helping him to get his group project ready to submit by midnight. Felt like I didn't get anything done that I wanted to do. 
 Ever get the feeling that you're talking but people are hearing something entirely different?

 That particular Python vid is one of my all-time favs-saying what you think means one thing, but everyone else hears something entirely different. Oh yeah . . .

 Welcome. Here you will find posts on just about anything, from the mundane to the insane, the outlandish to the sublime. I include a wide selection of quotes, images and music in most of my posts. If I am unable to present new content, I rely on that old favorite—the reblog. Be forewarned: I am a left-leaning, liberal, feminist who does not hesitate to speak my mind. Enjoy. 
 (Not much other social media for me except for my tumblr, Frenzy and Lightning, which you can visit  here  or below.) And you can find my various product reviews on Influenster  here .
