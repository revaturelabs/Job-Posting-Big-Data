 We are a fintech company with a patent-pending payments and funding platform. Our business model is truly innovative and revolutionary. We are looking for a Legal Counsel to join our product team. The person would be responsible for all legal aspects of the product and would get to shape the design of the product even before its launch. We are looking for individuals who can think out of the box, innovate, create and build. The person would also, working alongside top tier external counsels, lead the company's efforts in getting authorised under FCA's Electronic Money Regulations. This is a great opportunity for an individual to gain experience in a broad range of areas, and move up from legal role to general management. We are seeking individuals with 2y PQE in banking/commercial real estate/fund management. The role would be part-time for the first 3m and switch to full time thereafter. Besides cash salary, we offer an attractive equity stake in the company. The compensation package has been structured so as to attract individuals who are willing to have a skin in the game alongside rest of the team.
