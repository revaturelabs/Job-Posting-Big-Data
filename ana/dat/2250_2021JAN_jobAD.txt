 THE JOB AT BACKBASE 
 Backbase is expanding. In just five years, we grew from 50 to 900 employees and have no intention of stopping yet. To support our growth, we recently opened up a Development Center in Krakow in order to serve customers in the long run and make them successful. Next to our existing partners, we also love to work with new talent. The goal is to have a large vivid office in Krakow, being an important part of the Backbase family. 
 Technical recruitment is no easy task. We know that. That’s why we’re looking for someone who can identify top talent and own the candidate experience at the same time. Besides developing your network and managing business demand for new hires, you will also create an exemplary experience for all candidates. While creating a culture which allows for the best hiring decisions. 
 As a recruiter you will be putting the first boots on the ground who will establish the foundation of the Backbase culture and ways of working in the Krakow office. 
 You won’t be left alone. Our teams in the Amsterdam HQ will help you to understand what Backbase DNA is and the talent we are looking for. But we will heavily rely on your local network and market knowledge to find the best engineers in the city!  apply now
