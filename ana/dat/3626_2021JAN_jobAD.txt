 BEING FACETIOUS 
 
 When people, because of their words and actions, don't earn the respect of others, they earn derision and rejection. 
 To cite a few, such is the case of  ' Lord Cheeto '- PEEOTUS, '  Kellyanne Con-Job  ' -Chief Counselor to PEEOTUS and '  Sean Spitter  ' - Press Secretary. 
 They live in an alternate reality and have even coined 'alternative facts'. 
 When that is the case, be ready to receive push-back. 
 It you dish it out, be ready to take it!

 Kellyanne Conway cites ‘Bowling Green massacre’ that never happened to defend travel ban 
 Kellyanne Con-Job has taken “alternative facts” to a new level. 
 During a Thursday interview with MSNBC’s  Chris Matthews  , the counselor to the president defended President Trump’s travel ban related to seven majority-Muslim countries. 
 At one point, Conway made a reference to two Iraqi refugees whom she described as the masterminds behind “  the Bowling Green massacre .” 
 
 “Most people don’t know that because it didn’t get covered,” Conway said. 
 
 The Bowling Green   massacre didn’t get covered because it didn’t happen. 
 There has never been a terrorist attack in  Bowling Green, Ky ., carried out by Iraqi refugees or anyone else.

 I'm originally from Puerto Rico. I was born in Santurce and raised in Rio Piedras. I currently live in Florida - since 1999. I have a doctorate degree in Medicine; completed in 1976. My Internal Medicine specialty was completed in 1979. Worked for Puerto Rico's health system until 1985. At this time, I'm happily retired after working for the federal government for almost 28yrs. I also worked for the government of Puerto Rico from 1979 through 1985 .... for a total of almost 40 years as a physician. I want to offer any knowledge that I have to anyone "out there" who is interested. My views are liberal in almost every sense. My knowledge is "eclectic" - a bit of everything. Music and reading are my passion. Blogging has also become a very interesting endeavor. Metaphysical topics attract me. I'm interested in news - reporting human issues like injustice, discrimination and abuse - the "wrongly" affected. My intention is to bring this knowledge to an understandable level and to help anyone in need. I'm open to questions and will answer them to the best of my ability. Currently working on an enterprise whose main mission will be to bring peoples of all walks of life together. To be one .... since we ALL are ONE!! The future looks bright and promising!!!
