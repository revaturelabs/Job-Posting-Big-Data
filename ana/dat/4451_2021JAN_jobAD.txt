 🚀 Create and lead the customer success function in our rapidly growing FinTech 🚀 
 You will manage a portfolio of existing and new clients. This will include finance brokers and lenders across the UK. You will need to be able to identify and build strong relationships with key people within these organisations. You will need to be able to analyse their operation to support them in identifying key problems and opportunities where Nivo can help them deliver significant value for their organisations. You will help them in the design, training and implementation of solutions. If the customer encounters any issues or has any questions you will be their contact point through to resolution. 
 We expect Customer Success to grow over the coming months. Part of your role will be establishing best practice for Customer Success in Nivo. You will help define the key metrics we track, the processes we follow and the skills and techniques used. 
 You will have the opportunity to work with all of our close-knit team from across customer success, sales, marketing, product development, engineering and our board. You will be encouraged to actively contribute and shape Nivo's organisation and proposition as it continues its rapid growth. As one of the closest people to our customers, you will find that you're in high demand from our customer obsessed team to understand the things we can all day to best serve our customers. Through the knowledge and skills you build up you will be able to support the marketing of the business both across and beyond your portfolio by developing content for our support website, training materials, blogs, events and webinars. 
 You will be rewarded based on net promoter score, usage levels, the number of advocates you can foster relationships with and the new sales opportunities you can generate from your portfolio. As our business grows and you directly contribute to that, you will build up highly valuable skills and experiences that you can take forward throughout your career.
