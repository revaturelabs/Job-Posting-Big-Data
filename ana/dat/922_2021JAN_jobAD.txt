 Career-ending injury brought Inky Johnson his dream life 
 Posted on  November 26, 2020  |  Leave a comment 
 The dream from age 7 was coming true. Inky Johnson was in his junior year in college with all the paperwork signed for the NFL draft. He was among the top 30 and was guaranteed to make millions doing what he loved. 
 
 All he had to do was play 10 more games and his future would be set, but when he went to make a regular tackle against an Air Force player in 2006 -- a tackle “I could make with my eyes closed” -- the cornerback ruptured his subclavian artery and could not get up. 
 “I never thought about a career-ending injury,” Inky says in an Above Inspiration video. “I woke up from that surgery and the thing I placed my identity in was now gone.” 
 His right arm was paralyzed. Every day he lives with pain. But he rose above the crushed spirit and now delivers motivational speeches, encouraging people to serve Jesus and trust Him with their destiny. 
 
 Inquoris Johnson was raised in a 14-member household crammed in a two-bedroom home on Atlanta’s poor and violent side. His mom pulled double shifts to put food on the table, and Inky says he wanted to pull the whole family out of poverty. 
 Every day was dedicated to training to fulfill the dream. He drilled, worked out and practiced. His family attended church, and he asked God to bless his dream. 
 When he joined the Volunteers at the University of Tennessee, he became their starting cornerback and was on the trajectory to success; the commitment and effort was paying off. 
 
 Then he woke up on the fateful day and followed his usual routine: run two miles to the fire station and two miles back to warm up. Throw the football at the ceiling to practice catches at all angles by surprise. Visualize himself performing to perfection. 
 “Two minutes left in the game, and I go to make a tackle - that I can make with my eyes closed And I hit this guy and as soon as I hit him, I knew it was a problem, but I didn't think it would be this type of problem. When I hit him every breath from my body left, my body goes completely limp. I fall to the ground.” 
 Inky blacked out. His teammates came over to him and told him to get up. “Let’s rock man,” they said.  Read the rest: When bad things happen to good people: Inky Johnson's career-ending injury.
