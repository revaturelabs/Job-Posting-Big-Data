 Role overview 
 ABOUT US 
 You rarely get the chance to change an entire industry. But that's position we find ourselves in. 
 We're developing a machine that totally automates human cell production  🧬  - one of the most painful but important processes in biology. 
 Cells are crucial for biotech and pharma 🔬They're used to discover and develop new drugs, AND they enable state-of-the-art cancer treatments where cells are the medicine. Cytera has the potential to impact cure development across the board. 
 Today, every biotech loses so much time growing cells by hand! With our cell growing machines, for the first time they can hands-off grow and monitor cell batches from the cloud... ☁️ 
 We've assembled a world-class team to take on this challenge, with ex-Dyson engineers and Nature-published scientists working hand-in-hand. You can learn more about your potential Cytera teammates here: 
 Team 
 Cytera is backed by Y Combinator, the most successful startup program in the world which produced companies such as AirBnb, Dropbox, and Ginkgo Bioworks. 
 SOFTWARE AT CYTERA 
 Our cloud app is mission-control for our users, and it's where they spend most of their time. Here, they do everything from controlling and monitoring their live cells, to analysing data and planning experiments. This is where we can really delight users with carefully user-tested powerful features 
 We also use  on-system software  for orchestrating the underlying hardware, moving parts like pumps and imaging systems together to unlock user-facing functionality (PS It's very satisfying to see deployed code making physical things move around!) 
 THE ROLE 
 We’re looking for a high-growth software engineer to join our team. This is a fantastic opportunity to develop and learn from experienced colleagues within a high-autonomy environment. 
 We believe in high-growth candidates autonomy 📈 and you should expect to execute on multi-week developments and attempt to overcome hurdles you encounter, with your colleagues available to advise and collaborate with as you require. 
 The ideal candidate is someone who who can both quickly iterate to deliver software prototypes, as well as take time to consider well thought-out, scalable software when needed. 
 Things you could expect to work on: 
 
 Building out the  React-based web app  with user-facing features such as cell workflow design, as well as backend functionality such as notifications and authentication 
 Implementing  containerized services  that run on the physical machine and coordinate between the hardware and the cloud 
 Developing  data pipelines  to upload, store and analyse data such as images in  AWS 
 Solving physical-world challenges involving the hardware, by implementing software algorithms such as autofocus 
 
 Responsibilities: 
 
 Writing software across the tech stack (excluding firmware) 
 Working with founders and outcomes from user tests, to implement user-facing features 
 Ideating and collaborating with biology and hardware teams to tackle cross-discipline product challenges 
 Collaborating on architectural decisions with the other software engineers, as well as input from the firmware team 
 
 Must have: 
 
 Experience developing applications using  Javascript  and  Node (ideally  Typescript ) 
 Experience developing hybrid mobile applications or web applications using modern web frameworks such as  React 
 A firm understanding of  Docker  and containerisation 
 Nice to have:  Python 3 
 
 Benefits: 
 
 Competitive £35,000-£75,000 salary + stock options 💰 
 Lunch covered daily 🥯 
 Collaborative team environment with very high potential to learn new skills 📚
