 What is a crane operator? 
 Crane operators handle cranes and other lifting equipment (e.g. hoists) and transport loads to construction sites. 
 What does a crane operator do? 
 Crane operators control lifting machinery using buttons, levers, and pedals. They attach loads to hoists and cranes and safely remove them. Occasionally, they set up and repair equipment. 
 Crane operator duties and responsibilities also include: 
 
 Conducting equipment inspections 
 Following safety protocols 
 Keeping maintenance logs 
 
 What skills do you need to be a crane operator? 
 No specific degree is required for this role. Crane operators gain experience on-site or by completing relevant apprenticeships. They hold a commercial driver’s license and usually a relevant certificate (e.g. NCCCO certification in the US). Accuracy and knowledge of safety regulations and protocols are essential. Crane operators must also be able to lift heavy loads, climb on lifting equipment safely and stand for long hours.
