  Career Changers: Tips For Successfully Changing Careers  
 Lindsay Robinson 
 April 19, 2019 
 Changing careers can be a stressful and daunting task that seems almost impossible at times. Whether it's not knowing what career path to take, what skills to leverage or lacking experience, changing careers isn't easy. 
 During our weekly live Office Hours on YouTube, two of our coaches, Ariella Coombs and J.T. O'Donnell, answer questions live from viewers related to their job search, career success, on the job situations and more. 
 We complied a simple list of what we find to be the most common questions our coaches get about career change. We hope you find this helpful. 
 Here are the answers to some common questions around changing careers... 
 
 What if I am more qualified for a career that I am not excited about? 
 After 20 years of working for the same company I was made redundant and now would like to start contracting. However it seems all contracts go to those with a history of contract work. How do I overcome this? 
 When changing careers and they about your current salary and you know they may not be bale to match or beat it, is it better to be honest? Will this hurt you or help you? 
 I've spend years gaining experience in a different field but want to go back to the industry that I love? What should I do? 
 What is the best way to overcome the "have you managed people" requirement when you don't have that much direct experience? 
 Want to get help with your career transition? Ariella, J.T. or our team of trained coaches would love to help!
