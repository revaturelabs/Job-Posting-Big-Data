 Steve Jobs (1955-2011) 
 I already posted a couple of  pics  and a very cool  video  of a deeply-moving commencement speech that  Steve Jobs  gave at Stanford in 2005 on our sister  blog , so, thought I'd break it up a little and post my favorite quote from the speech here. 
 
 " Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose…you are already naked, there is no reason not to follow your heart." - Steve Jobs 
 Man, just imagine all the amazing shit we could get done if we stopped caring what other people think and forged our own path through life. Steve Jobs didn't just talk about changing things up and thinking different, he lived it. And the world, and my life for sure, is a better place because of it. 
 Thanks again for everything you did to make our world a much cooler and truly  magical  place, Mr. Jobs. You will be greatly missed…
