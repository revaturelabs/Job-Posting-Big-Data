 About the Job 
 Our growth and expansion means that our consumer web application needs to be highly polished, yet designed with sufficient flexibility to add new products, customize workflows, and cobrand with our partners. We also develop and maintain internal applications that provide significant leverage to our operations teammates. The backend that runs all of this is evolving toward an event sourced architecture that supports the highly asynchronous and multi-modal workflows we are automating.

 Quick study that readily picks up new languages, frameworks, and tools 
 Person who cares deeply that your work realizes positive outcomes for our world

 Utilized a variety of databases for different use cases (e.g., relational, document, graph, object storage) 
 Scaled out infrastructure using automation tooling (e.g.,  Pulumi ,  Terraform , CDK) 
 An interest in functional programming libraries, and/or functional programming languages in general 
 
 Technologies we teach and use: 
 
 ReactJS ,  TypeScript ,  Scala ,  Ruby ,  Python 
 Pure FP TypeScript libraries (fp-ts, io-ts, matechs) 
 Postgresql, Redis, FireStore, BigQuery, S3/GCS 
 Google Firebase, Apache Beam, Scio, Rails 
 Heroku, Google Cloud (PubSub, Functions, and others) 
 Rollbar, Segment, CodeFresh, LogDNA 
 
 Perks: 
 
 Flexible hours and remote work 
 Fantastic health, dental, and vision 
 Three weeks of annual PTO 
 6-10 weeks of parental leave 
 Culture focused on cross-functional collaboration
