 Please, do not adjust your monitors. 
 
 Yes, I know it is Thursday and  not   Waffle Wednesday . But some weeks, one day of celebration is just not enough. 
 
 Same protein waffle recipe as  yesterday . But today topped with  Lori ’s  buckwheat honey marshmallow fluff  and  almond butter mixed with syrup. 
 
 So  much decadence for 9 in the morning. I almost couldn’t handle it. But then I got a grip on myself and gobbled it all up :) 
 Other wonderful eats from the day included a  homemade shrimp burger.  I remember seeing shrimp burgers on the menu of a burger place in Calgary. I desperately wanted to try it, but knew that when in Calgary, you eat the beef. Needless to say, the idea of a shrimp patty has been teasing my taste buds ever since. 
 
 Started with a  dozen   large raw shrimp  (bought frozen then defrosted). Cut up small then mixed in: 
 
 1 tbsp bread crumbs (I used a smashed up rye cracker) 
 1 tbsp egg whites 
 1 tbsp mayonnaise (Yes a whole tablespoon. Do it.) 
 Pinch dried garlic 
 Pinch red pepper flakes 
 Pinch black pepper 
 
 It’s not a sticky mixture like beef or turkey burgers. Very wet and sloppy because shrimp is so, well, wet. I plopped it on my George Foreman grill, but you could also put it in a frying pan or the oven. Just make sure it’s at a low temp and as time to cook on one side so it doesn’t crumble when you try to flip it over. 
 
 Makes one  large  patty. Eaten on an english muffin with spinach, red onion, ketchup and mustard. 
 
 Ohmy. It was goooood. The mayo in the mix is what really made it tasty. I have a feeling my taste buds will be wanting this more often! 
 
 On the side I had some of my  microwave sweet potato chips.  All you do is slice up a sweet tater real thin, spread it out on a plate, season, and nuke for a ludicrous amount of time. For these, I microwaved them for 10 minutes, flipping halfway through. Once cooled, they get crunchy like a chip! 
 While not eating today, I was also exercising. Almost done the first week of  my new lifting split  and I really like it! My body was completely hammered after a week off exercise.  Major  DOMS after my first couple days. Even from just doing sprints on the elliptical! Anyways, if you’re curious, here is what my  Shoulder/Abs  workout looked like today: 
 Warm-up:  5 minutes walking on the treadmill + 1 mile run 
 **Straight sets: 
** Arnold press  @ 10 lbs x 15 
15 lbs x 10 
20 lbs x 5 
10 lbs x 10 
 **Alternating sets (x3): 
** Cable lateral raise  @ 2.5 lbs x 12 
 Cable horizontal woodchop  @ 12.5 lbs x 12 
 Superset  **(x3): 
** Mountain climber  x 60 sec 
 Plank ups  x 10 
 **Superset (x3): 
** Russian twist  on bosu 6lbs x 30 
 Plank  on bosu x 60 sec 
 Superset (x3): 
 Squat with front raise  x 20 (holding swiss ball) 
 Prone jackknife  x15 
 Cool-down:  1 mile run + 5 minutes walking 
 That opening press set killed my shoulders. It was all downhill from there ;) And in case you can’t tell, I hate doing crunches. Give me a plank any day! 
 Kind of ironic that I just started myself on a weight lifting focused workout routine, as I suspect  I may now be doing a lot more running! 
 You see, I got a part-time job! At a running store!! 
 Even though I am a full-time personal trainer, I still don’t work the usual 8 hours a day. My client base is still increasing, but I am finding myself with a lot of down time. Especially on weekends. So I’ll be selling running shoes, clothing, gadgets and apparel to Toronto runners in my spare time. The extra money will be great and I’m really looking forward to meeting some more fitness-minded folk! They also do a run club and running clinics that I’ll probably start participating in as well. I’m pretty stoked about the employee discount. I’m desperate for a new pair of running shoes! 
 I’d just like to say, as for my full-time job of training,  I am  loving  it.  I’m to the point now where I’m starting to see results with my clients (one guy has already dropped 8% body fat with me!) and it is  so  rewarding. Not to mention, I’ve already had a few clients renew training packages with me, so it’s nice to know they like and respect me enough to want to keep working with me! 
 Now I am off to pack! I’m heading to  Buffalo, NY  for weekend with some friends. A special edition  Fitness Friday  post will be going up, but it will have to last you until I’m back on Sunday. Have a great weekend everyone! xo

 Congrats on the new job - maybe you can score some great running stuff! 
 I wish I could hire you to get my body fat down LOL! I should probably just lay off the fluff and cupcakes…. 
 Shrimp cakes look divine!

 So many comments. First, I've been reading! Just not commenting because law school just started so I've been pressed for time - thank goodness I can access my google reader on my itouch. Second, I need to defriend you on facebook - I find out all the surprise new before the post goes up ;) (just kidding of course! CONGRATS on the new job - I'd like to already put my request in for some tips on buying the correct running shoes. thanks) And third, I'm starring this post for sure because most of the exercises are things I can actually do at home with my free weights. So thanks for that too!

 PS Enjoy Buffalo!

 I am so happy for you that training is going so well!! Makes me lean toward getting my certification again. How rewarding that your clients are making progress and coming back! 
 And I am so stoked about your method of cooking sweet potato chips in the microwave. I have never thought of that, but how handy! Will definitely be stealing this idea from you:)

 Congrats on the part time job! That's exciting news! I'm sure you'll meet some cool people and maybe even some new clients. 
 A shrimp burger. That's a first. Seriously I don't think I've ever seen one of those.

 Woohoo! Susan, that is great. I've come to find (working two jobs myself) they are more fun when they involve something you like doing. I work part-time as the front desk attendant at my boathouse. So much better than retail! 
 If I could have waffles like yours, every morning would be a waffle morning! I've never thought of putting Fluff on a wuffle but I'm going to have to give it a try now :)

 Your "wuffle" typo made me laugh, and now all I can think of is "fluffles" for fluff waffles ;)

 I like the part where you put the chile flakes in the bowl with the shrimp. :D 
 Looks great. I love fish burgers in general and although I admit I've never made shrimp burgers there is no doubt in my mind that this would be right up my alley.

 My name is Susan, I'm a 20-something living in Atlantic Canada and this is my blog about... me. I used to blog about food and fitness, but that all changed in June 2011 when I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. After six months of chemotherapy, I was declared cancer-free in January 2012. I now write about anything and everything as I stumble through my post-cancer world. I'm a trained journalist currently working as a writer/researcher. I also have a background in personal fitness training and nutrition. Welcome to my piece of the internet!
