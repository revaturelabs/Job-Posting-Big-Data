 Eco-friendly Out of the House Essential Kit for the New Normal 
 Posted on  April 28, 2020April 28, 2020  by  ecoingenuity 
 
 Whether we like it or not, these ecq and lockdown precautions is still needed to be retained even post lockdown. 
 We salute all husbands for doing grocery shopping for the family. 
 As we embrace the new normal, here are smart tips to prepare and bring when you do need to leave the house to run critical errands like grocery run. 
 1. Compact, Hands-free Essentials Kit 
 Jacinto & Lirio Lakbay Travel Essentials Kit 
 Use J&L’s travel essentials kit to store essentials that are unworn like alcohol, tissue, pen , masks, money, phone, pocket notebook and other must brings. 
 It stores your basic out of the house essentials and keeps them easily accessible, while still being slim enough to tuck in your garment for less exposure from viruses. 
 2. Lanyard 
 Jacinto & Lirio Obra Lanyard 
 Attach our Obra vegan leather lanyard to convert your Lakbay travel essentials kit to a one carrying pouch to keep your hands free and carry all your stuff easily by hanging this from the neck. This way your hands can be used to carry your grocery purchases. 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
 Jacinto & Lirio Obra Lanyard  (Design Collaboration with Obrano Heritage Goods) 
 Aside from attaching to the Jacinto & Lirio Lakbay Travel Essentials Kit, it’s perfect for your ID badges, cards, card holder, keys and small gadgets. It securely holds your personal items while being stylish and durable too. Important items are just within your reach!

 This is a favorite among employees and students because when they're going out for lunch, they don't need to bring their bag and wallet anymore with this card holder. They just insert their ATM and credit card in their Jacinto & Lirio Kaibigan ID Card Wallet which includes a slip-on garter to secure paper bills and zippered exterior pocket for coins. 
 For this Covid pandemic, you may use garter securely holds your grocery checklist as well. Then when the lockdown is over and normal public transportation is operational, you can just insert your beep card here.

 3. Notebook 
 Does the scenario below sound familiar? 🙂 
   
   
 Well you're not alone… 
 You can rescue your clueless husband when grocery shopping by including this Jacinto & Lirio pocket notebook for their errand checklist with illustrations of differentiating cuts of meat and various types of fish and vegetables. This way, he doesn't have to coordinate with you as much via viber or buy the wrong items. 
 This will also lessen his time outside thus decreasing exposure to any virus. 
 4. Pen 
 Tree Hugger World Eco-pen 
 Don’t use public pens. You never know if the last person who used that pen is infected. Best to bring your own pen. 
 5. Waterproof jacket with hoodie 
 Permanent Fly Waterproof Jacket with Hoodie 
 The infection can linger anywhere from your head to toe. So it's best to limit skin and even your hair exposure. 
 6. Gloves

 "Thoroughly washing your hands for at least 20 seconds remains the best defense against COVID-19. But when you go to the grocery or other public places, you may not have access to soap and water, hand sanitizer or wipes to clean grocery carts. That’s why some people are wearing gloves. But do note that the virus can still adhere well to latex and other types of gloves, if you touch your face at any point, you’ve still potentially exposed yourself to the virus. Proper glove use is key" - Ohio State University 
 Gloves may be bought from Shopee, Lazada, Watsons or Mercury. 
 7. Eye protection 
 The virus is also airborne. This means your eyes need protection as well. 
 Not to mention the fact that it's not as easy as it sounds to apply this rule **" Don’t touch your face." ** This is a lot harder than it sounds and requires conscious effort. The average person touches their face  23 times an hour , and about half of the time, they’re touching their mouth, eyes, or nose — the mucosal surfaces that COVID-19 infects.

 Given this, it's best to wear an eye protective wear to limit the temptation of touching your itchy eyes. 
 8. Mask 
 Style Ana Reusable Face Masks 
 This is something we are all fully aware off and we probably all have since this is a basic requirement to protect ourselves. But the question is, which type of mask should we wear?

 9. Tissue 
 Sanicare pocket tissue and wiples 
 Incase you need to touch our face, press the elevator buttons or other public place items--using a tissue is your best option. This is a basic must bring even before the pandemic. 
 
 10. Phone 
 Bring as little items as possible. This includes being bag free. Attaching your phone to a lanyard is the key to this convenience. 
 11. Alcohol or Sanitizer 
 Human Heart Nature Natural Sanitizers 
 Did You Know?  Human Nature Natural Sanitizers contain  60% alcohol (sugarcane-derived ethyl)  thus meeting the recommended standard for alcohol content in sanitizers by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Learn more at  bit.ly/CDCNCoV . 
 It's not just our hands that we need to sanitize nowadays, but everything we bring out.

 Why being part of our Jacinto & Lirio team is different! We're hiring! 
 Posted on  August 22, 2013August 29, 2016  by  Noreen Bautista 
 Jacinto & Lirio is hiring for a social business manager! 
 
 Our enterprise, EcoIngenuity Inc is now on its 3rd year! 
 So many things have happened already, and our young team has learned so much in building a business that strives to embody the values of social entrepreneurship. We have been involving volunteers and interns in our work, and they have helped us build our enterprise to where it is now, and for that we are grateful! 
 In the end, there is still so much more work to be done. But here are 5 reasons why joining our team at this point in time is more exciting and different from before: 
 1. We 're gearing for bigger growth! 
 Admittedly, we are still not as big as people think we are. But our goals are still definitely bigger than ever! We have nationwide partnerships with stores outside Metro Manila, (Cebu, Davao, South Luzon, Cagayan de Oro, Iloilo, Bacolod, and soon Boracay). We exported our first shipment to the Middle East early this year and are actively looking forward to partnerships with distributors in US, Australia, UK and Japan. 
 You will be surprised what a lean team of young entrepreneurs can do to make that happen. 
 If we can get more passionate and stellar team mates on board to push more excellence in our marketing work, we can even reach more shores, and achieve more sales to channel back to the  our community partners . 
 2. Unique entrepreneurial experience 
 Just hear from our previous interns on how their experience was with us:  https://jacintoandlirio.wordpress.com/2013/04/29/social-entrepreneurship-advocate/ 
 https://jacintoandlirio.wordpress.com/2012/08/22/a-meaningful-summer-at-jacinto-lirio/ 
 Although we don't promise a walk in the park (it rarely is!), but we strive to open the eyes of those we work with to the awesome journey of entrepreneurship, as we ourselves learn how to build a business that strives to achieve positive social impact. 
 3. More mentors involved 
 We have amazing partnerships brewing with mentors from  CBS  (Consulting Business Services for Social Enterprises of the Benita & Catalino Yap Foundation), our alma mater Ateneo de Manila University, and partner organizations who have been with us right from the beginning  (Philippine Business for Social Progress ,  Ayala Foundation , etc.) 
 4. Collaborative Projects 
 Take part in our upcoming collaborative projects with fellow social enterprises: 
 Human Heart Nature , 
 The Dream Project , 
 MUNI 
 and (something very exciting for us!) 
 KIVA.org 
 5. #LiveYOURStory Campaign 
 One of the key pillars of our efforts this year is our  #LiveYourStory  Campaign. It is an advocacy that aims to empower our customers to live the story that they always wanted to live. To create their own story, connect with the stories of others, and empower more people through their stories shared. It roots back to our own experience in Jacinto & Lirio -- how we stumbled on this amazing story of the water hyacinth plant (a nusiance that was turned into a material of elegance), that was transformed by community artisans into beautiful products that in turn empower both those who buy it, and those who created it. 
 We know a lot of people need to live their own stories as well. Being part of our team, will allow you to be part of this movement in getting people to #LiveYourStory! Of course, we are set on embodying this as well, so you will get to LIVE YOUR OWN STORY as you grow with our team.

 [Sustainable Living Hacks](https://jacintoandlirio.wordpress.com/category/sustainable-living-hacks/ "Welcome Jacinto & Lirio, Eco-chic Social Socialites! 
 
 JACINTO & LIRIO (meaning “Hyacinth” and “Lily”), is a social enterprise that transforms a “pest” into eco-iconic and multi-functional vegan leathergoods sustainably made from water hyacinth, with a mission to empower affected families by the water hyacinth infestation problem through livelihood generation. 
 This community was created to celebrate the lifestyle of men and women who empower 
 For decades many women have aspired to be the “It Girl” in society. The “Socialite” –active in social circles, always revered for her sense of style. However, today’s “Socialite” and “It Girl” has evolved from merely a thing of beauty and status to a woman of substance. She is more than just a pretty face; she’s smart, stylish, fabulous, generous, and truly empowered. 
 Jacinto&Lirio highlights women who redefine the socialite or the “it girl”. 
 We are witness to the emergence of a new consciousness of women in the fashionable world. These are women who are looked up at, not just for their stylishness, but also for their proactive work in empowering society. They are more proactively involved in their advocacy (unlike the generations before them who’s philanthropy was defined by the amount of checks issued to charity). She is a woman whose actions and opinions influence positive change in society—The Social Socialite") (1)
