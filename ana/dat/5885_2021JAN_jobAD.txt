 What is a hydrologist? 
 Hydrologists study water properties (e.g. volume, flow) on the earth’s surface or underground, and resolve water-related issues, such as contamination. They develop techniques to improve the quality and quantity of water in a designated area. 
 What does a hydrologist do? 
 Hydrologists collect water samples from several sources (e.g. lakes, soil) and measure levels of contamination. They analyze data with computer models and predict water supplies. Hydrologists work closely with other scientists and engineers to design water-related structures, such as hydroelectric power plants. 
 Hydrologist job duties also include: 
 
 Forecasting floods, snowstorms, and droughts 
 Designing methods to decrease environmental impact from erosion and water pollution 
 Writing reports and presenting results 
 
 What skills do you need to be a hydrologist? 
 Hydrologists have excellent mathematical and analytical abilities. Critical thinking and effective problem-solving are also important skills for this role. For professionals in more senior positions, project management and team leadership are must-have skills. Finally, hydrologist education requirements usually include a degree in hydrology, engineering or relevant STEM field. 
 When preparing your own hydrologist job description template, make sure to mention these skills in the requirements section.
