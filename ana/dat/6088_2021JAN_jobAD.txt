 The Skill That Will Help You Land A Job Post-Crisis 
     J.T. O'Donnell 
 and 
     Work It Daily 
 June 09, 2020 
 After this crisis subsides, there will be a huge shift in the way employers hire. There will be a lot of supply, but not enough demand for jobs. So, how do you stand out from the other candidates? 
 
 "There will be a lot fewer jobs post-crisis, which will drive up the competition between job seekers. So if that's the case, now employers will have to have criteria in order to choose." 
 There's one skill that can help you stand out from the competition. In this episode, I discuss what that skill is, and how you can develop it now.
