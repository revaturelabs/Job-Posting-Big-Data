 Work From Home Jobs

 More and more companies are beginning to have some of their employees work from home or are outsourcing positions to companies who hire employees or contractors to work from their homes. 
 If you’ve been thinking about pursuing a work from home career, there is no better time than right now to start looking. As with anything online, always be careful with the information you share and do plenty of research on the companies you are looking into before diving in and giving out your personal info. 
 As for the type of jobs that you can find to work from home, there are a ton of different skill sets that companies are looking for and the opportunities and variety continues to increase with advances in technology. The positions that are probably most plentiful are customer service and sales positions which will have you either handling customer issues for a variety of industries or attempting to sell products and services over the phone taking inbound calls or making outbound calls to prospects. 
 There are also plenty of work from home positions available for those of you with more technical skill sets or specialized areas of expertise. The search can be frustrating at times, but you can usually find something that is a good match for you if you are willing to look hard enough and perhaps suffer through some trial and error. 
 Now before you go jumping in to a new work at home career, you need to make sure you do an honest evaluation of yourself to determine whether or not working from home is really something for you. 
 Working from home is completely different than driving in to work every day. For many people, it takes more discipline and motivation to make a 30 second commute to work instead of a 30 – 60 minute one. You are often working independently and some jobs have a very flexible schedule, which makes it much easier and very tempting to blow off working in favor of something more enjoyable. 😉 
 In order to make a successful transition from a traditional job to one where you work from home, you have to make sure you are ready for the additional freedom and responsibilities needed for these positions. 
 Here is a list of some companies that offer jobs that can be worked from home(some hire you as an employee while others may be looking for independent contractors):
