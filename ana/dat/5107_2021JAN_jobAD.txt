  4 Ways To Breathe New Life Into Your Career  
 David Kovacs 
 July 03, 2015 
 Do you feel stuck in a dead end job? Do you wake up every day, go to work, and do exactly the same thing over and over again? This is no way to go through life. No salary is worth being miserable over. You can get out of this mundane career without even changing jobs. All you have to do is have a little tactful motivation and take advantage of what is right in front of you.  Related:   4 Things You Can Do To Be Happier At Work Today  Here are some ways you can breathe new life into your career: 
 
 1. Take Advantage Of Opportunities 
 Many of our jobs get us in this dull routine, which eventually becomes a perpetual rut. Getting out of that rut requires desire and motivation. It’s never just going to happen for you. What can you do to recharge your career? Start by being open minded. This means not only looking for opportunities, but also creating them for yourself. The best chances in life are often only there for a fleeting moment, and you have to be prepared to jump on them at any time. 
 2. Learn When To Say Yes (And No) 
 The next item on your list should be learning when to say yes and no. You can’t be known simply as a ‘yes’ person (or a ‘no’ person for that matter) but both words can help turn your job around if you use them properly. Looking back at opportunities, you need to be fearless and ready to step out on a limb by simply being willing to say yes. This willingness to try new things, take on different tasks or even get transferred can open up an entirely new world to you. At the same time you should never be afraid to say no. Many of us get overworked and burned out at our jobs because we don’t know when or how to tell someone no. It’s a simple capitalistic tendency to expect more and more out of employees - and often times those expectations are simply unreasonable and make workers miserable. Be tactful and respectful, but no is a word that is ok to use in your professional vocabulary. 
 3. Reinvent Your Job 
 If the repetition of your job is dulling your mind, think of ways to challenge yourself. Even find new ways to do the exact same task that you’ve always been doing. There are other ways to mix things up as well - try taking on different shifts to free yourself up at different times to help make your social life more exciting. Challenge yourself to be better - set goals for yourself and find ways to achieve them. You just might find yourself having fun, and this could end up getting you noticed for a raise or promotion with any luck. Speaking of challenges, taking on new responsibilities is a way to bring new excitement to your job. If you are bored, chances are your job is too easy for you. Ask someone for more responsibility. This will open up new doors and fresh challenges daily. Sometimes even picking up a smaller part time gig on the side can aid in making your main career more enjoyable. The more you do, the harder it is to get bored and fall into that dreaded career rut. The possibilities are endless, but you have to be proactive and make things happen. 
 4. Take A Break 
 Finally, taking an extended leave or even a gap year and travelling the world or simply spending time with family and friends can help put everything in your life into perspective. Many companies offer ways to continue employment after a leave or sabbatical, so you can have this time off without fear of losing your job or starting over. You can even use this leave to enhance your skill set and learn the skills needed to do your job better. Making your career more exciting is up to you. There is no easy  career hack  or switch you can flip to breathe that fresh life into your job. Keep your mind sharp and be open to trying something new - even if it intimidates you!
