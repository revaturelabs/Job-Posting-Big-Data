 Dr. M. C. Saxena College of Medical Sciences Lucknow 
 Oct  2 
 
 Welcome to Dr. M.C. Saxena Colleges of Medical Sciences 
 India plans to establish some 200 new medical colleges in the next 10 years to meet the projected huge shortage of 600,000 doctors. The basis for arriving at this huge projected shortage is the recommendation about minimum doctor population ratio of 1:1000 made by ‘High Level Expert Group (HLEG) for Universal Health Coverage’ constituted by the Planning Commission. There are about 6-6.5 lakh doctors available, but India would need about four lakh more by 2020 to maintain the required ratio of one doctor per 1,000 people. By any reckoning, it’s a tall order and ours is one leading step in meeting it to serve our society. 
 We are based in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. Our mission is to create generations of medical talent which India will reap. Sex Ratio in Uttar Pradesh is 912 females for each 1000 male, which is below national average of 940 as per census 2011. We aim at creating awareness in people to save the female child. Uttar Pradesh has one of the highest infant mortality rates in India. As per sample registration system report 2011, of Registrar General of India the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) per 1000 live births is 57 which is above the IMR of India of 44 and both being way above IMR of Monaco, at 1.81! One of Our goals is to help reduce UP’s IMR as much as possible. 
 Our medical college comprises of following sections : 
 
 
 We have 300 bedded multi-specialty hospital equipped with state-of-the-art equipments providing comprehensive treatment and ultimate care for patients, coming from several part of India.

 We provide health care facilities for patients from in and around Lucknow and nearby districts. 
 We strive to help the needy patients by offering them free treatment with the latest medical facilities. 
 We offer various health checkup plans for individuals. Our services include, casualty, ambulance and pharmacy
