  30-60-90-Day Plan: Your Key To Getting The Job Offer  
 Peggy McKee 
 October 19, 2015 
 Are you getting interviews but not job offers? As a career coach, every week I speak to job seekers like you…they are amazing, talented people with resumes good enough to secure interviews—but they don’t stand out enough in the interview to get the offer. This is a problem for everyone, from brand-new graduates to seasoned executives.  RELATED: Need some job search advice?  Watch these tutorials!  In a sea of qualified, talented people, how can you stand out and get the offer? It’s easier than you think. The key to standing out in any interview and getting the offer is to  create and use a 30-60-90-day plan  in your interview. Using a 30-60-90-Day Plan got me five job offers the last time I was in the job search. When I became a recruiter, I insisted that my candidates create and use a 30-60-90-day plan, too—because I knew it would get them hired. My coaching clients who use it now regularly get job offers in minutes, or even receive offers for more senior roles at higher salaries. Once you try it, you’ll never go to another interview without one. 
 
 What Is A 30-60-90-Day Plan? 
 A 30-60-90-Day Plan is an outline of what you plan to do in your first 90 days on the job. 
 Why Is A 30-60-90-Day Plan Powerful Enough To Secure A Job Offer? 
 They take away the risk of hiring you. 
 Think about this: Hiring is a risk for any boss. If they make good choices and build a solid team, they are seen by their upper management as a smart leader who can choose good resources—and they are rewarded. If they choose to hire people who aren’t a good fit, it drags them down. Their judgement is suspect, and maybe their job is in jeopardy. If you help them know you and how you work, and they can visualize you in the job, they become much more confident that they know you and what will happen when you get there. When it comes to hiring, bosses never want a coin toss—they want a clear winner. 
 They elevate you above all other candidates. 
 When you discuss your plan with the hiring manager in your interview, it dramatically boosts your communication with him or her about the job. You end up discussing it in detail, and have a much more substantial conversation. Because you must do your research in order to create a plan, you appear very polished and confident to the interviewer. All of these things make you stand out. I encourage you to learn more about these plans and create one for your next job interview.
