 Would you like a seasonal opportunity to live and work in an outdoor enthusiasts paradise, high on top of the stunning Bighorn Mountains? Interested in working in hospitality? Our Lodge is seeking a friendly, motivated couple or individuals to fill out our staff for the 2019-2020 winter and summer season and beyond. The start and end date are somewhat flexible, but ideally the winter position would begin December 1st and run to the end of March.  The Summer position will begin June 1st of 2020 and run through September, 2020 with potential for a full time position as well.  Compensation is commensurate with experience, and paychecks are given on a monthly basis and gratuities bi-monthly. On-site housing in a clean cabin in the winter and a 30ft camper in summer is provided as well as 3 meals per day, access to the laundry facility, wifi, and use of our public wash house. 
 Applicants should be outgoing and very personable in order to help create a welcoming environment for lodge guests.  Tasks are repetative so appplicants should be okay with the same tasks everyday.  Applicants should also be in good physical condition and capable of spending most of the shift on their feet. 
 The daily duties of the job include but are not limited to: turning over lodge rooms and cabins after guests have checked out (making the beds, vacuuming, mopping, cleaning the bathrooms, and dusting), washing and folding laundry, stacking firewood/other landscaping duites, washing dishes, keeping the common areas of the lodge clean as well as the public wash house, answering the phone, and generally helping the guests to enjoy their experience at the lodge as much as possible.  Cooking and food prep is needed as well.  Kitchen expierence is helpful but not necessary. 
 We are located in a true mountain paradise, perfectly suited to someone who loves the outdoors. During free time in the winter, there is snow shoeing, x-country skiig and if you prove to responsible and capable, seasonals are allowed to used a trail sled to explore the mountain and if you are interested in Snow kiting we have a few of those as well to try out.  Sitting by the fire in the our greath room is also nice during you time off.  During free time in the summer, there are endless hiking trails around the lodge, beautiful waterfalls, wildlife viewing opportunities, and lots of places to take amazing photos. The closest town is about 30 miles away from the lodge, so we are truely a remote destination within the Bighorn National Forest.
