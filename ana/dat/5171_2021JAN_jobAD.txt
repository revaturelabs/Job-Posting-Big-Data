 Financial Accountant - Birmingham - 45- 50k 
 Gleeson Recruitment Group are supporting a service organisation in Solihull who are recruiting for a Financial Accountant with a specific responsibility for the maintenance and development of the Group's financial control systems and reporting of the Group's financial performance in accordance with the business need and applicable statues and standards. 
 This role will report into the Financial Controller who is keen to pass on a wealth of knowledge to ensure that the person moving into this role will have the necessary support to ensure they are successful. The team break the mould when we describe stereotypical accountants and enjoy working in a fast paced and fun environment where there is an emphasis on delivering results. 
 An outgoing and positive attitude is the only essential requirement for this role because the reporting team have built a strong team culture, and believe it's important that a new member of the team is willing to ask questions, constantly be looking for a new challenge and ultimately enjoys working with similar minded individuals who actually enjoy coming in to work every day. 
 The Group Finance team has a variety of departments, which ensures that progression is possible. The culture has been built around communication, and the Finance team are big advocates of resolving issues and answering queries face to face rather than via phone or email (where possible). Being able to challenge and Influence will be essential for this role as stakeholders have strong opinions and expect that any information provided is broken down into easily digested information. The role will have the usual expectations of a Financial Accountant, however, the business is looking for a hands on individual who is happy to be involved in a wide range of ad hoc tasks and projects. 
 Flexibility is also there for the right person and a typical working day is between 9 - 5pm with an hour for lunch, however, late evenings and early starts may be required at month and year end. 
 Is the Financial Accountant in Birmingham role right for me? 
 We are looking for somebody that is looking to develop within a large organisation and is keen to use their experience gained within practice in Industry. You will need to be Qualified ACA or ACCA with a wealth of experience in practice or in a technical role in Industry. Although this role is technically focused, it is essential anybody applying for the position is willing to build relationships across the business and is not afraid to challenge the status quo, with an aim of supporting change and pushing through best practice.
