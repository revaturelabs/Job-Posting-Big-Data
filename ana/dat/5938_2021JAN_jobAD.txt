 Career Coaching

 Anita Torres 
 Location: Central Florida (Mt. Dora, FL – 45 NW of Orlando) 
 How will clients benefit with you as their coach? 
The old adage of “it’s not what you know, but who you know” takes on a different twist when working with me as a career coach. Career coaching, with an emphasis on emotional intelligence, guides the client through known and unknown behavior patterns that may have an effect on achieving professional goals. Therefore, to expand on the old adage…it’s not what you know, or who you know that matters most these days – it’s how you interact with others that makes the difference. That difference is in the power of using your emotional intelligence skills for career success. Interviewers ask questions of candidates to reveal behavior patterns that can affect organizational values and core competencies. 
 What results have clients reported after working with you? 
 
 Increased confidence in setting and reaching goals 
 Increased personal and professional communication skills 
 Heightened awareness of personal blind spots 
 
 What do clients say about working with you? Here are a few testimonials: 
 
 Anita was knowledgeable, insightful and down to earth. I enjoyed her coaching immensely. 
 Initially, after taking the Six Seconds Leadership Evaluation, I had no idea the impact it would make on my life. Being a newcomer to the area of EQ, Anita was very thorough and patient in explaining this concept and all of the competencies. She then explained in detail my areas of strengths and those areas that might be holding me back from reaching my full potential. 
 Because of her insight and coaching, I have been able to make changes not only in my professional life but also in the way I manage my family and communicate with my husband. In summary, Anita's coaching has made an immediate impact in my life and I look forward to learning and growing through her future workshops and/or coaching sessions. 
 After working with Anita Torres, I was able to implement tools which produced immediate results in my professional life as well as my personal life. In learning the things that I didn’t know I did not know about myself, I am now enabled to make big, positive strides in the directions I want to go. I have always been goal oriented, but now I am so much more aware of how to set my goals, why I choose those goals to set and how to reach those goals. Thank you, Mrs. Torres!
