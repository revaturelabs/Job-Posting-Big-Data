 Lars Beurer, business studies student 
 "My sport requires me to train with focus on my goals. This also helps me at winkler: working and studying at the same time – following my goal with ambition and concentrating on the matter in hand. As I pass through all the relevant departments in my job, I can intensify my knowledge at co-operative university at the same time." 
 Stefanie Marx, junior departmental manager 
 "Dancing is a team sport. You are dependent on each other and you can only ever be as good as your partner. That is something I also keep finding at work – and I like it." 
 Marco Peschel, warehouse logistics specialist 
 "In my free time I am passionate about the fire service, I'm a fireman heart and soul. I find it moving to help people who have got into trouble. Together with my comrades. It's not that different at winkler. There too, team work and cohesion are considered important. I have to be able to rely on the others. And that's as it should be." 
 Martin Rüter, Team Leader 
 "My management responsibility at winkler means that I have to deal with a lot of very different characters. You have to be good at adapting to people. It's the same when you're dealing with horses. They aren't all the same, either, and need to be treated sensitively. You have to adapt to their character." 
 Thomas Saalmüller, Branch Manager, Sales Manager South-East 
 "On a mountaineering expedition, you experience people as they really are. You keep coming across situations where things get tricky. You learn a lot about people while you're doing that. And this is also the essential feature of a management position – that you know how to get on with people. Because people are the focus – at the company, just as they are on a mountaineering expedition." 
 Markus Burgstaller, technical specialist adviser 
 "At winkler you aren't just a number in a big faceless corporation. Social matters come first. You can exploit your potential, bring in your own ideas. Strong team play – that's also what drives me as new talent manager at the football club." 
 Tradition with a future 
 As a family business over 100 years old, we have developed a very particular tradition: we recruit our managers mainly from our own ranks. This is why we give good training and in-service training such a high priority, together with an environment with individual potential for development at over 40 locations all over Europe: 
 
 seminars and in-service training courses for professional and personal development 
 flat hierarchies and short communication routes 
 independent working and jobs with responsibility 
 a good working atmosphere and mutual co-operation with colleagues 
 and of course, secure jobs
