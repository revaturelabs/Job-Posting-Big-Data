 The Guide to Landing an Awesome Remote Job 
 Tips, Guidelines and Examples To Help You Land Remote Positions 
 Introduction 
 Working from a traditional office can become a problematic issue for workers looking to manage their own time and who enjoy having flexibility in their schedule. 
 If you find yourself tired of the 9 to 5 routine and realize you're growing unhappy with your current work situation, maybe it's time to get a job that prioritizes work-life balance and allows you to work the way you want, from anywhere you want. 
 This guide gives you important information on the skills you need to become a successful remote worker. 
 Considering Coworking in the Greater Boston Area? 
 We’d love to have you join the Workbar community. 
 Let's Talk 
 Creating a Resume for Remote Positions 
 Remote positions are usually a great option for modern, mobile workers who enjoy being part of a company or team but don't necessarily want to be tied to a corporate office. 
 In order to make the switch to the remote workforce, you will need to build a special resume for remote positions exclusively. Keep in mind that being a remote worker has many benefits, but it's also demanding, and there are some specific skills you'll need to have in order to succeed – no matter what industry you're in. 
 
 Key Skills Remote Workers Need 
 If you have never held a remote position in the past, it is likely that you are not aware of all the aspects involved. Even if you decide to move to a remote job in the same industry you have been working in for years, there will be changes in your work style that you need to prepare for. 
 To help you make this transition smoother, we have compiled a list of some of the most valuable and desired skills for remote workers – so make sure you master these and include them in your resume for remote positions. 
 
 Personal and Organizational Skills 
 1. Time Management 
 When working remotely, no one will be there to manage your time. No one will really know at what hour you arrive at your coworking space or start working. One of the biggest advantages of working remotely is the ability to design your work day in a way that works for you and adjusts to your personal schedule, which is great, but this won't work if you are not able to manage your time. 
 It's crucial to learn to calculate how much time each tasks takes you, so you won't end up having to work extra hours if you can't finish a project by its deadline. 
 John Tiler from SuperiorPapers says, “When I started working as a writer I had such a hard time managing my time. I was always late with my tasks and I was almost on the point of being fired. Keep in mind that a remote job requires a lot of discipline and dedication!” 
 2. Self-Motivation 
 Most remote jobs work like this: they give you a task that needs to be done in one week and they won’t tell you when and how to work. It’s your own decision when you start working on the task. Therefore, if your motivation is weak, you will have a hard time completing the task and keeping your job. 
 A great tip to work efficiently is to create a daily to-do list to keep you on track. At the end of the day make sure to check off the things that were successfully performed throughout the day. It’s not hard, but motivation and discipline are real game-changers here. 
 3. Proactivity 
 Just like with the point above, being proactive is one of the most important character traits remote workers must possess. In a remote position you have no one to keep track of your progress, so everything falls on your shoulders. It will be on you to communicate with your managers about completed projects, feedback, requests you have for other members of your team, etc. 
 Sure, being proactive is an ability that's required for most jobs, but it’s even more important when you’re working remotely. Working from a distance will mold you into a more responsible and disciplined person, so be sure to put something indicative of this on your resume for remote positions. 
 4. Prioritization 
 In order to work efficiently, you must be organized and properly prioritize your assignments. There are a few things you should be aware of before trying to prioritize your tasks, such as knowing your most productive time of day. 
 If you are a morning person, start the day by tackling your most important projects. If you need an hour or two to settle in, start your day with smaller tasks and then move on to larger assignments. Knowing yourself helps you better prioritize your tasks and be more productive. 
 5. Team Player Mindset 
 Becoming a team player is a vital to become a successful remote worker. Your team may be spread all over the world, so it's very important to be willing to step out of your comfort zone to collaborate with them. 
 Without effective communication and the ability to work together to reach a goal, a company that has employees all over the world won’t be able to develop and grow.

 Let's Talk! 
 Technical Skills 
 1. Digital Communication Skills 
 If you wish to work remotely, learning how to communicate efficiently using digital platforms is a must. This means knowing how to manage your email, how to use any company-wide messaging platform and how to initiate a video call to chat with your team. 
 Even more, it would be ideal that you know how to create reports that focus on sharing vital information with project stakeholders. 
 These might seem like very basic skills but they are vital for remote workers, so make sure you acquire them before you apply to any position. 
 2. Tech Skills 
 Working remotely is impossible without the aid of technology. This doesn’t mean that you need to become an expert – unless, of course, you work in the tech industry – but you certainly need to know how to use a number of productivity tools such as project management platforms (like Trello),video-call software (like Skype), and messaging services (like Slack). Becoming accustomed to these tools is essential if you want to work remotely. 
 3. WordPress Skills 
 WordPress is one of the most popular platforms for website creation. Learning the ins and outs of WordPress and coding websites can help you become a successful programmer in the future. 
 Still, even if you are not looking to become a programmer and don't have much interest in website development, knowing how to use basic functions in WordPress can help you create websites with multiple purposes, like online stores, blogs, product sites and more. Knowing how to handle WordPress is another great skill that hiring managers could be looking for, and it will be an added bonus to have it on your resume for remote jobs. 
 4. JavaScript Skills 
 JavaScript is used a lot these days. Many websites are designed using JavaScript and the functionality and interaction between these websites is maintained and created using these programming language. While this is not a skill that will be expected from you when you first apply to a non-tech remote job, it's certainly valuable knowledge you can develop. 
 If you are interested in tech innovation, learning this programming language would be a great achievement that will propel you directly into the heart of remote working, considering a lot of remote positions in the market are in the tech industry. 
 5. Data Analysis Skills 
 Learning how to analyze data is a useful skill to have if you wish to work remotely. This will give you the option to apply for jobs in marketing, web development, and of course in data analysis. 
 One of the best tools to become more proficient in is Google Analytics, as this is a software many website operators use to measure the performance of their sites. If you know how to work with and interpret data, you will be a valuable member to any remote team focused on assessing the success of a product or service. 
 The Bottom Line 
 Working remotely can be a fantastic option for workers who want to be more independent and have autonomy over their work. However, transitioning from a traditional job to a remote position can be challenging and requires effort, dedication, and most of all, adaptability. The skills noted above will help you figure out if working remotely is the right career move for you.
