  3 Places To Find A Job You Love In 2015  
 Ryan Niessen 
 October 03, 2015 
 If you’re feeling underappreciated, underpaid, disengaged or disenchanted with your work…  You’re not alone.  Years back, I was in the same situation, and according to a Gallup Poll -  70% of Americans don’t like their jobs.   RELATED: Need some job search advice?  Watch these tutorials!   What turned things around for me was being  inspired . Because you know what?  My biggest problem was that I didn’t know what was possible.  I didn’t know what kind of incredible opportunities were out there. So my goal for this article is to inspire you. I’ll reveal what some of the most amazing companies in the world are doing… And then show you where to find them (plus - how to get their attention and get a job). 
 
 3 Places To Find A Job You Love In 2015 
 1. GameChangers 500 
 Founded by Andrew Hewitt, the  GameChangers 500  features the world’s top “For-Benefit” companies. That means they exist not purely to make a profit, but also to  make a difference.  Each organization is carefully analyzed and given up to nine badges based on the criteria of a “For-Benefit” (also known as “Purpose-Driven”) company. Badges include: 
 
 Having an exceptional work environment 
 Empowered employees 
 An earth friendly office, and 
 Meeting their mission 
 
 And companies range from giants like Google and Whole Foods, to smaller ones like Guayaki, Kiva, and Etsy. Laser tag fights, paid time off to volunteer with your favorite non-profit, and flexible hours are not uncommon perks you’ll find in this new sector of business... And the GameChangers 500 is an excellent place to start your search for an inspiring company that  empowers and engages you. 
 2. B Corps 
 Here’s a great description of what it means to be a “B Corp” from their website:  B Corps  are certified by the nonprofit B Lab to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.   Today, there is a growing community of more than 1,000 Certified B Corps from 33 countries and over 60 industries working together toward 1 unifying goal: to redefine success in business.  As you can see, B Corps is a rapidly growing movement of businesses solving social and environmental problems, and they’re a great place to find a fulfilling job this year. 
 3. The Gateway Method’s Dream Job Resource Guide 
 The GameChangers 500 and B Corps are two of the biggest and best places to find a job you love in 2015. However, there are also 12 other top-of-the-line websites with TONS of opportunities with inspiring, purpose-driven organizations. Andrew Hewitt - the founder of the GameChangers 500 teamed up with me to create  The Gateway Method , where our mission is to help people like you find and get jobs you love… with companies that are making a profit AND a difference in the world. That’s why we put together this  free resource guide  for you, sharing 14 job sites (12 + the 2 I’ve already mentioned.) Inside that guide is also the link to a free video sharing a few tangible tips on how to get the attention of this new breed of organization, and get a job you love. Happy purpose-driven job seeking!    This post was originally published at an earlier date.
