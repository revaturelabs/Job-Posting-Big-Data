 Digital Crate Digging Continues on a Throwback Thursday; it's been a cool rainy day in Atlanta.. 
 A perfect mood for the Sunday Jazz type of vibe!! earlier? not off the rails like  Trump on Fox and Friends  I was rocking it with my friends!! chilling out with the tribe, those that understand a brotha! 
 Perfect food of the Sunday meal type will work for ya!!! the vibe is soon uplifted… 
 Perfect fools play too much!! shady deals are soon exposed after priorities shifted..
