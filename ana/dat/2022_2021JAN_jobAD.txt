 Jobs Listed by Which Season 
 (Larry comments....) 
 I would like to see the seasons of job listings separated into two seasons, winter and summer jobs. Being from the north, I would like winter jobs if I happened to be a snowbird looking for work. 
 Coleen, the working while RVing editor replies: 
 Larry, thank you for your comments. It is good to hear suggestions from our website and newsletter readers about what we can do to make our services for RVers (and those who hire them) better. 
 It's especially nice when the suggestion is something that I've been thinking about doing or have in the works. And, good news for you, that is the case here. I am working on adding pages that have jobs according to the seasons. I do hope that you and other Workers On Wheels readers find them helpful.

 Workers On Wheels is our website and newsletter about working while RVing -- working while living in a home on wheels. There are so many kinds of work to do while RVing and camping (what some campers call workcamping or work camping). We help RV workers -- whether snowbirds or full-time RVers -- find campground jobs, volunteer jobs, jobs with RV spaces, seasonal jobs, mobile employment, short-term paid employment, and other ways to earn an income and cut expenses while enjoying life in a recreational vehicle. Thanks for visiting our WOW website! ~ Jim, your Workers On Wheels editor, at work-for-RVers-and-campers.com
