 Craft CMS/Commerce/Plugin Developer REMOTECONTRACT 
 Job Description 
 Hello, I'm a freelance web designer relatively new to Craft CMS. I'm looking for another freelancer who is experienced with Craft and can develop plugins and make customisations to Craft. I'm predominantly a designer/front-end guy so would love to form an ongoing relationship with someone who can handle custom developing and programming. 
 I have a current project that needs a custom plugin for a payment gateway (Secure Trading) to handle subscriptions as well as importing entries via CSV, bulk editing entries and sending email notifications among other things. 
 How to Apply 
 If this sounds like your type of work, please get in touch by sending an email and we can arrange to have a chat and see how things could work.
