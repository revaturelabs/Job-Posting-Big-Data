 How Strong Is Your B-Team? 
 March 27, 2014March 27, 2014   Gregg Foss   Human Resources   Change ,  Economic Readjustment ,  Financial Recovery ,  Jobs ,  Productivity 
 Turnover isn't an issue organizations face with just administrative and operations employees, it affects all levels of a firm’s hierarchy including C-level executives and upper management. Does your team have other players that could step up if a key position became vacant? 
 As the economy and job market improves, top producers and effective leaders may be recruited or start looking for a better deal. This possibility is real, and if organizations aren’t proactive, they could soon be impacted by loss in efficiency and loyalty among the staff left behind. It may be prudent to make the changes needed to “beef up your bench” in a way that is not stressful and helps ensure the firm remains productive during the process. 
 Obviously, losing senior executives could have a major effect on a firm and the way it operates, but what about less-senior employees? There are other individuals throughout an organization who play a vital role in maintaining resourcefulness and driving innovation. Though there may be no need to prepare for mass exodus, it is important to start training others in case a key player does leave for another job. 
 In developing a deeper bench it’s important to know who would be the best person to fill a position should a manager leave. Fortunately, hiring managers may not have to look too far to find a suitable replacement for an exiting leader. Are there current employees who show signs of leadership potential? Identifying who will be able to fill executive roles is not necessarily a matter of seniority. Focus on whom best fits the requirements of the position. 
 Understanding the leaders an organization already has is the first step in being resilient to turnover. However, having a B-Team in place if change occurs is the step needed to truly foster sustainable success that’s built to last. Firms that are prepared for the future are the ones that stand the best chance of seeing it.

 Changing Roles 
 February 21, 2014   Gregg Foss   Human Resources   Change ,  Jobs 
 Making career changes can be more of a dilemma than most of us might imagine. There are some fields that are more difficult to leave than others. Certain ones, in many of our minds, seem to have required more of a "calling" or humane dedication. For example, an individual who wants out of the teaching profession may have a difficult time in doing so. Thought seems to be very pervasive that we shouldn't encourage people to leave such a caring role. A minister or priest is generally perceived to be on such a pedestal, that if we respond to their application for a change in vocation, we may feel ourselves to be a participant in an unpardonable sin. Social workers, who may have gotten into well-doing at a young age, in some instances have cast their lot forever. 
 It's rather interesting as we sit in our Ivory Towers, how many of us know better what is best for everyone else. Changing roles can be important to all of us; even those in human resources. There are many fields where experience can be transferred very effectively into a complete new area of interest. Often, an organization can benefit greatly from the perspective that a fresh approach can offer.

 What's Around The Corner? 
 January 16, 2014   Gregg Foss   Human Resources   Economic Readjustment ,  Employment ,  Hiring ,  Jobs ,  Productivity ,  Staffing ,  Temp-To-Hire ,  Temporaries 
 A number of organizations are wondering what hiring and human resources will look like in the future. With the beginning of the New Year this is a great time to consider predictions. The following is what we expect to see in 2014 and beyond. 
 Temporary is the new permanent.  One thing that will remain constant in this year is uncertainty. Given the current unpredictability in the economy – such as the recent governmental shut-down, stock market fluctuations, and reluctance to move ahead with new initiatives, we foresee firms will likely continue to bring on temporary workers when help is needed. 
 Part-time hiring on the rise.  While various factors will influence hiring trends, we anticipate employers will hire more part-time workers in 2014. 
 The way we work is changing.  Many firms are starting to re-evaluate their staffing needs and this development is particularly notable in the legal field. Skilled attorneys, paralegals and other support staff are recognizing these new options and are entering the temporary and part-time labor pool. A number of clients feel that this is the best way to attract needed, skilled employees, and it provides greater opportunities for cost containment. In addition, bringing on an employee in a “try-before-you-buy" scenario can be a good way to assess whether a candidate is right for a position. 
 Demographic shifts are occurring.  An increasing number of individuals will look to contract, part-time work and other less-than-long-term employment. Here’s why: Younger workers are more mobile and receptive to contract staffing. Technology is providing the flexibility people need to use their skills in new ways. Combine these and other factors with a firm’s focus on controlling expenses, and you have both the employment model as well as the needed workforce to propel growth. 
 Are you ready to see how temporary staffing solutions can benefit your firm’s objectives? If so, I would like to discuss your staffing requirements and help create a recruiting plan that will assist you in achieving them.

 Cover Letters Should Matter to Employers 
 January 8, 2010January 8, 2010   Gregg Foss   Human Resources   Cover Letters ,  Jobs ,  Resumes 
 Job searching specialists recommend that job applicants write a customized resume cover letter to accompany each resume sent to an employer. They’re right! As a recruiter, a customized resume cover letter matters. 
 A resume cover letter saves you time, connects the candidate’s relevant experience to your advertised job, and provides insight into the candidate’s skills, characteristics, and experience. The factors viewed as important by your candidate are emphasized in a resume cover letter. 
 As an employer, you are also seeking the resume and cover letter that describe the candidate who will best fill your position. A thoughtful resume cover letter tells you that the candidate took the time to customize his application to fit your needs. Perhaps the applicant with a superior resume cover letter will make a superior employee. 
 A well written, carefully typed, error-free resume cover letter should immediately set the application apart from the average application you receive. Candidates who fail to spend the time to construct an effective cover letter deserve less attention than candidates who understand the cover letter’s importance – and write one.
