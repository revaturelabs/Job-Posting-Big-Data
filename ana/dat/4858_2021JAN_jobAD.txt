 Tips for the Emotional Spender! 
 Emotional spending has two basic components. One is when 
you spend money on things that are not needed or really wanted.  The second is when you spend money because you 
are unhappy or stressed out. Uncontrolled emotional spending can lead to 
financial ruin.  To make better financial 
decisions, it is important to understand and manage our emotions. 
 Emotional triggers come from external and internal sources.  External influences like advertisers spend 
millions of dollars appealing to your emotions so you will buy their products.  Manufacturers have influenced our society by 
promoting holidays and all kinds of reasons to spend money.  Holidays like Valentine’s Day (to prove you 
love someone), Easter, Christmas and even back to school have become commercialized 
for big sales days.  Today more women 
work outside the home and we are made to  feel  like we must compensate for not 
being there.  So we buy our children 
things.  These factors increase emotional 
spending by making us feel ‘bad’ if we don’t. __ 
 We can limit advertisers influence on our spending.  Here are a few things you can do: 
 a. 
Stay out of the Malls 
 b. 
Opt out of credit card offers 
 c. 
Sign up for the Do Not Mail Registry 
 d. 
Install an ad blocker on the computer 
 e. 
Unsubscribe to emails from stores and catalog mailings 
 f. 
Block TV sites like QVC, the Shopping Channel, etc… 
 Internal factors and tips for women who are 
spending emotionally. 
 
 Self 
esteem issues- not feeling special.   When you don’t get the respect and 
recognition from others you feel you deserve, you decide to give it to yourself 
by shopping.  When you take care of everyone 
else and don’t take care of yourself on a regular basis, you then  feel  like you  need  to do something for yourself even if the item purchased 
is not needed. 
 
 Tips  - Get in touch with your feelings.  Just before you spend money ask yourself; Am 
I feeling less than?  Often women don’t 
ask for what they need from others. 
Getting better communication skills and managing your environment will 
give you a sense of control and power.  When 
we have control we become powerful and will make good decisions in our lives 
and our finances. 
 2.  Stress- 
We all react to stress differently. 
The brain and our hormones play a big part in how we feel and react 
to stress. There are actual changes in the brain that occur when we spend 
money. The elation we may get from shopping only provides temporary relief 
to stress. We must deal with the cause of the stress and find other ways 
to deal with your emotions.  Do a 
check up from the neck up! 
 Tips  -   Understand 
how you react to stress personally.  Try 
replacing spending money with other things you like to do.  Exercising, dancing and spending time with a 
friend or family.  Do things that don’t 
cost money. Go to a park. There are plenty of free resources.  Seek them out!  Watch out for emotional triggers. Ask 
yourself, am I angry? Stressed?  Lonely? If 
so handle that emotion before spending money! 
 
 Buying 
on impulse . 
You go in the store for one thing and then purchase five other 
things.  These impulses can wreck a 
budget if you’re not careful.  Rationalization 
is part of impulse buying.  You tell 
yourself “If I don’t buy it now I will not get the opportunity again”. Purchasing 
things that you know you can’t afford. 
The use of credit cards allows this reasoning to flourish. 
 
 Tips  - Go to stores with a list.  Stick to it! 
Take a friend with you who will hold you accountable for what you say 
you are going spend.  Make a decision to 
give yourself at least 24 hours from the point of looking to the point of 
buying.  Leave credit cards home and 
carry only the cash you mean to spend. 
 Have a budget and follow it.  Budget  for 
necessary expenditures  and  a  little  emotional spending. If you can’t 
afford it, don’t buy it! You don’t want to incur excess debt. Keep track of 
your spending.  $1 here and there adds 
up.  Too many small bills can go 
fast.  Did you ever notice what happens 
when you break a $20? 
 I want women to live 
smarter not harder. Emotions influence the way women spend money. By taking 
control of your environment and your feelings you can pay your bills and exercise 
power over your finances.  With this 
information we will create a better future for ourselves and our children.  It’s all about financial intelligence and being 
powerful women.

 Too much documentation in nursing? 
 Talking to a fellow nurse today discussing how much documentation nurses must do to justify that standards of practice are met.  The mantra we are taught right from nursing school is "If you didn't document it ; it wasn't done"  We have been led to believe this in our educational, tracks, our jobs and governing organizations like CMS.  Even our own nursing organizations have us believing that we need to document  every  response to "  everything  " to prove that we are practicing our craft appropriately. A lot of nurses feel they are documenting more than providing care.  Some areas of nursing are not experiencing this pressure.  How about you?  Where do you stand on the issue?  Is there too much documentation being done?  Is it all necessary?

 Stress 
 Our jobs as nurses  lead  to a lot of stress. Stress affects our emotions which affects how we learn and behave. We think we manage it well because we get the job done. (and well I might add). But what do we do with those emotions? Most times we turn them  inward . If we can't learn about ourselves and our staff, (due to stress) we can't move ahead. If we can't move ahead we will not feel a sense of accomplishment or fulfillment. Without those feelings we get burnt out. Burnout is well-known to lead to an increase  medical errors  affecting our patients and also it leads to health issues for nurses, apathy and irritation with each other. If we do not learn how to handle stress, we nurses, as a profession are in deep trouble. 
 We need to take charge of our lives! We need to recognize and deal with stress. Excercise, yoga and meditation are some well-known ways to decrease stress. I like to travel and read to relieve stress in my life. If you want to live a more peaceful and contented life, make changes in your life. Become aware of and manage those things that "stress" you out. Sometimes it may just to "forget about it"
