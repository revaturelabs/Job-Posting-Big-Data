 Job: Elementary School Librarian 
 Posted on  April 28, 2016  by   sarahgprescott 
 4.28.16 -  Elementary Librarian

 Sarah P 's comments : A late opening from one of the top schools in the Middle East. ASD has been around for years and has become as large school with a hectic work pace in a city with crazy traffic. However, it is still a good place to work and, if you like city, life, Dubai is a crazy, vibrant place where something is always happening.
