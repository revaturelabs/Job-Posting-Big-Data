 Who are Kelsey's family? 
 Kelsey has a very tight knit family. The star suffered a terrible tragedy when her younger brother passed away back in 2013 from spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). 
 The disease can take away people strength, as well as their ability to walk, eat, and even breathe in the worst case scenario.

 What does Kelsey like most about being on TOWIE? 
 Kelsey told Bobby, in an interview with  OK!  , that she likes being on the show as she is able to campaign for awareness for sister’s illness.

 “We’re doing a charity fundraising day on TOWIE. I’ve always wanted to do something like that.” 
 She then added: “I’ve had hundreds of messages, loads from families going through the same thing. And everyone’s just saying they’re proud of me. 
 “It was hard because I don’t really like speaking about it as I get upset, but I’m glad I did it.”
