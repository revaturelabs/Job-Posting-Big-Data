 Have you ever felt like your  job search  was pointless? Or that you would never get the promotion you needed at work? Or that things would be different if you were the one running your company? Don’t fret - things are likely to turn around with determination, motivation, and a pinch of inspiration. A great way to raise your spirits and stay positive is to enjoy the peace of sitting down with a hot drink, a warm blanket, and a great movie. Here are a few  inspirational  movies that might help you put your career troubles (or any other issues) into perspective. 
 
 The Pursuit of Happiness 
 Embark in the journey of the life of Chris Gardner (Will Smith), a struggling salesman, on his search for financial stability and true happiness. Gardner is a single father struggling to keep food in his and his son's the mouths by selling medical devices that have long been outdated and are virtually useless. Gardner knows he must find his way out of this rut that he calls life. Through hard work, determination, an internship, and a little bit of luck, Gardner lands the job of his dreams and finds the stability that he has always longed for. Gardner’s son is played by Smith’s son, Jaydin Smith. This real life bond helps to intensify the struggles and joy endured throughout their pursuit of happiness. 
 The Devil Wears Prada 
 Welcome to NYC! The city of bright lights, up-and-coming starlets, and the  fashion  mecca of the world anxiously awaits. Watch as Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) fights for acceptance and notoriety in the fashion writing realm. With a boss like Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) Sachs will be faced with many tasks that are designed to be unachievable. Although Sachs originally thinks Priestly to be the Devil herself, she soon realizes the passion and love for the company Priestly has. Sachs soon learns the true meaning of respect, dedication, commitment, and passion. 
 It’s a Wonderful Life
