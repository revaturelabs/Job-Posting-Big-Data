 Those Lazy Welfare Bums Need To Get Jobs 
 1 Comment  Posted by  Peter Parkour  on October 30, 2013 
 It's so easy to be critical when you have a supportive family, job, house, computer, high speed internet, cable TV, phone, car, a full belly and your tomorrows look bright as well. I'm sure struggling day to day and depending on the kindness of others wasn't their first choice of lifestyle. 😐

 For most, I believe it is a situation beyond their control…a downward spiral. We should never judge when we don't know their story….because maybe it could have been ours. 
 Agreed, well said. Thank you for stopping in, mishunderstood, and for taking the time to leave a comment.
