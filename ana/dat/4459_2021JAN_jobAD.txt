Our experienced teachers will share their skills in creating large scale wedding and event installations.You will use the best quality plants and flowers to create exciting flower displays. Our main goal is for you to approach floristry with a variety of different styles, and to discover your own.

This work experience will give you even more confidence to start your floristry path, and will also help you to build that critical portfolio. At the end of the course, you will also be rewarded with our floristry certification.
