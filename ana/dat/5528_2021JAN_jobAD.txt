 Work with the global open source community to form mutual growth opportunities with THIS SITE! 
 Role overview 
 This role can be fully remote within the EU and preferably in the UK as we are HQ'd in Shoreditch in London. 
 As our Open Source Community Manager you will help drive the adoption of our  Open Source Issues  section of our platform. 
 Here is an example of how Open Source Issues are presented on WorksHub. Contributors can directly work on real technical problems as a way to discover what companies are doing and skip through archaic technical interview processes. Alternatively, global open source projects can use our platform to spread awareness and grow their supporter base. 
 About WorksHub 
 Our platform can be roughly divided into three areas, across which we need to independently grow user engagement: 
 Open Source  : Individuals or Companies who maintain Open Source Software projects can use WorksHub to promote them. Perhaps they need help working through issues or want to get wider exposure. This functionality requires demos and on-boarding for users. 
 Articles  : Our blog is a dedicated source of learning for our users. It is understandably content driven, therefore engaging with content providers to create win-win opportunities will be a large part of driving traffic and users to WorksHub. 
 Jobs  : Each of our Hubs also hosts a dedicated Job Board for companies trying to hire. Our Company users have free access to our Explore package and are able to upgrade for open access to WorksHub’s products. Company users are an important part of our community as they can provide unique company content and are our main source of revenue. 
 To do  : 
 
 Increase volume of open source projects shared on WorksHub 
 Increase volume of contributors to projects 
 Identify target companies and other prominent OS project maintainers 
 Create marketing strategies around our open source partnerships 
 Create win-win relationships for WorksHub and their partners 
 Work closely with our development team to provide feedback 
 Work with marketing and development teams on product roadmap 
 
 What We Need 
 We are very open minded to applicants from many different backgrounds and encourage you to apply. That being said, there are certain signals for us that may greatly assist you: 
 
 You are a very strong independent worker, who can set goals and motivate yourself to reach them. 
 You have experience working with developers and/or open source groups. 
 You are numbers driven and can create metrics to track your results over time. 
 You are generally speaking an outgoing character, confident in approaching strangers and tend to be received warmly.
