 About imgix 
 At imgix, we are building the "graphics card" for the Internet. We provide image and visual media processing on-demand via a URL-based API. We connect to a customer's existing images (e.g. S3 bucket) and then provide a domain they can use to access those images dynamically, creating any number of sizes, crops, adjustments, and other variants of those images. Think of it like Photoshop's "Save for Web" feature but for a million images at a time.

 imgix is building the future of visual media on the Internet. imgix operates the premier solution to deliver impactful, engaging, highly responsive and super fast imagery to eyeballs around the world. The service consists of a top tier image delivery platform tightly coupled with imgix's proprietary, on-demand image processing pipeline. It provides customers with great design flexibility while reducing the engineering investment required to serve state-of-the-art visual media. imgix enables our customers to greatly increase the value of their imagery and get back to building awesome things. 
 We are located in downtown San Francisco, close to BART, Caltrain, and a really good sandwich place. Because of COVID, we are working remotely and will be remote-friendly going forward even after we can return to the office. Employee benefits are comprehensive (401k, medical, dental and vision), perks are generous (catered lunches, paid rides home, the occasional team outing), vacation time is flexible, parental leave is available and highly encouraged, and salaries are commensurate with experience. We also provide employees with anything they (reasonably) need to be effective in their work: funky keyboards, standing desks, a desk cactus, and maybe even a laptop. The troposphere is the limit. 
 Technology 
 We maintain two separate technology stacks, one designed to perform all of the image processing we do and one for configuring those image processing pipelines for customers. Our image processing infrastructure is built using technologies such as haproxy, varnish, Lua, Go, Objective-C and C++. It handles >100K qps of requests and >10K qps of image renders. Our configuration and customer management stack is built on Python, Mongo, mySQL, nodejs, and Angular.
