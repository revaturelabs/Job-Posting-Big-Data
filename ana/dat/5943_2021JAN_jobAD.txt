 We are digitising the wholesale process for thousands of small businesses around the UK, helping independent brands and makers get their products on the shelves of retailers and boutiques. 
 Consumer marketplaces like Amazon, Etsy and Farfetch have flourished over the past years. However, the story is not the same within B2B space - thousands of small and medium-sized brands and retailers still conduct wholesale trading through pen&paper, spreadsheets and trade shows.
