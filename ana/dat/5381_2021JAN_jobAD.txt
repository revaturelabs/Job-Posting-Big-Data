 Company Description 
 GMR Delivers was started in March of 2020 in order to separate operations from Grand Mountain Rides. We started delivering food under the name Grand Mountain Rides on 30th November 2019. We quickly realized that both companies have totally different game plans, customers, and marketing strategies and therefore would have to separate and run as 2 different companies. During the time we separated the companies, we also added an exciting addition to our team. This addition would be our new app and website. Having outgrown our current system, we also knew we needed a better option. We did have a bit of a learning curve, and also a few bugs to work out, however the system is now working great and we are proud to have it a part of GMR Delivers. This also makes life so much easier on the drivers as it tells them what to do every step of the way, just like the GrubHub or UberEats app would. We currently cover the Winter Park | Fraser | Tabernash area and hope to one day soon offer delivery to Granby.
