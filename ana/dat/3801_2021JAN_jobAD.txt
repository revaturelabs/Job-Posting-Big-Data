 My First Job 
 Posted on  September 19, 2019  by  BibleBloggerGirl 
 On Tuesday, I got my first job! The business was only the second one I've ever even sent my resume to. Praise God I found a job so quickly! What an answer to prayer! 
 I'll be working for a small company that does bus tours and charter bus rides. They needed someone to help with a little of everything, from cleaning the buses to designing ads to sitting the owner's dog while she is away on a tour. The owner is a Christian, and her three children all work for her. She's very personable and I think I will like working for her. 
 
 We have yet to figure out my hours, but she already told me that I'll start above minimum wage (minimum wage is $8.25 and I'll begin at $8.50). I'm so happy and grateful for this opportunity! I'll try to keep you guys updated on how everything is going. 
 
 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.  - Matthew 6:33, KJV 
 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.  - Philippians 4:19, KJV 
 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.  - Matthew 21:22, KJV 
 
 What was your first job?

 Kind of. Except when it rained, or a dog chased my bike.

 Yay! Praise God for His provision! Sounds like a great first job! 
I guess my first job was babysitting the neighbor kids. Once I finished high school, my first job was records clerk in an insurance company. That was back in the day before internet and emails, so real "snail mail" came in, and we had to find the actual, tangible folder that the mail pertained to.
