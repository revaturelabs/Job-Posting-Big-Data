 Live in care jobs are for persons who are eligible to provide care for children, elderly, or persons with disabilities, right in the comfort of the patient’s home. The compensation they offer for live in care jobs is higher than the legislated minimum compensation.

To qualify for caregiver work abroad there are certain rules that must be followed and the live in care jobs candidate must complete the following:

 Six months of full-time training or 12 months of experience in live in care jobs or in a field or occupation related to the job you are seeking as a live-in care giver. 
 Ability to speak, read, and understands either English or French. 
 You must be able to function independently in a home setting like contacting emergency services if required and to understand labels on medication. 
 
 When applying for live in care jobs, the applicant for the live in care jobs must submit an essay describing himself, letters of references, and a written application. She must also be ready for a phone interview and an in person interview if possible. To the chosen candidate for the live in care jobs, the live in care jobs client is offering a salary of 1200-1500 CAD per month for 40-44 hours of work per week.

 Good day mam/sir i am sonia 43 years of age from philippines i have 4 children, my educational background was i studied medical technology for about 2years and i graduated at my caregiver course for only 6months I have a certificate from National Certificate for Competency released by Technical Education and Skills Development Authority TESDA of the Philippines.and also certificate of my caregiving course , Many scammers are here here so until now I have difficulty finding a good employer, and who can help me for my visa fee because I don’t have enough money its ok to me if u deduct on my salary.. I want to work in your country in many years because i want to help my family by doing my skill work in caregiver/childcare ,the salary here in philippines was not enough to purchase all we needs and wants… i am working now as medical secretary for about 8years my doctors specialist was pediatrician. i am a flexible person and trustworthy in everyway.. i want to work as caregiver/childcare because it is my skills and i love the way carrying anyone.i am a flexible person and trustworthy in everyway. I'm looking for employers that will help me for my visa fee because I do not have money for the visa fee even if they just deduct my salary its okay to me.. I am a very dependable, trustworthy, patient and caring person. I get great satisfaction out of helping others. I like to think of myself as not only a senior caregiver, but also an senior companion. I enjoy meeting new people and learning new things. I believe that our seniors are a glimpse into our past and should be respected and celebrated. im looking forward to hear you soon….thanks and godbless…
