 Product Description 
 First 100 Words 
Employee job satisfaction is plummeting, and pay has very little to do with it. A 2005 TNS survey conducted for the Conference Board, a worldwide business membership and research organization, finds just 50% of respondents reporting satisfaction with their jobs. 25% are just "showing up to collect a paycheck." Job satisfaction occurs across all income brackets. 
 Employees who like their jobs tend to think for themselves and go the extra mile in finding solutions to workplace problems. They also contribute to a more positive work culture by being positive and pleasant to work with. While a certain percentage of employees will always be unhappy with their jobs, there are positive steps that managers can take to raise the rate of job satisfaction in their workplaces . . . 
 When To Use 
Helping employees enjoy their jobs more; supervisor simple steps; responding to teams to stimulate excitement; eliminating monotony; encourage work-life balance. 
 How to Use 
Training, coaching.
