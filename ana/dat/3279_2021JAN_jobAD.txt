 Bite Size Memoir No.6 "First Jobs" 
 “I think many people need, even require, a narrative version of their life. I seem to be one of them. Writing memoir is, in some ways, a work of wholeness” 
 Sue Monk Kidd 
 For anyone new to  Bite Size Memoir  , this little exercise is intended as inspiration for  anyone  to spend 5 minutes here and there, to record some personal memoir in small manageable bites. 
 This prompt has now closed - Read the round up of submissions [here](https://sharingthestoryblog.wordpress.com/2014/06/12/first-jobs/ "First Jobs")! 


 
 There’s a prompt every week and some constraints to keep it small (with full details at the bottom of this post). Feel free to dip in and out without the need for commitment. If you have your own blog and want to participate, please incorporate links to and from your post to encourage readers to blog hop. 
 This week’s prompt is  “First Jobs”  - I’ve deliberately left that plural because to debate which of my ‘first jobs’ was actually my first, is a whole philosophical exercise and the important thing is perhaps more, what is significant about the early experience of work and its shaping of us. 
 As usual I’ve tackled it in two ways to provide examples and there’s a reminder of the rules at the bottom. 
 _" Accept who you are and revel in it” _ -  Mitch Albom 
 My 10 x I remember statements: 
 I remember being small enough to sit inside the bonnet holding a torch while my Dad worked on something. 
 I remember the ‘washing up’ chart on our kitchen wall. 
 I remember that cleaning the whole house took 4 hours for £5 pocket money. 
 I remember my hands blistering, packing daffodil bulbs one summer. 
 I remember the older women wore rubber gloves but didn’t warn me. They didn’t laugh but they didn’t want me ‘permanent’. 
 I remember others getting the well paid potato picking jobs but you had to ‘know’ somebody. 
 I remember the TSB share issue and bunging any old postcode on the incomplete applications. 
 I remember bar work in the local pub and knowing the regulars orders before they got their coats off. 
 I remember waitressing and A unintentionally lining up a row of peas in a large cleavage! 
 I remember spilling scalding gravy in a man’s lap and his horror as I tried to wipe it off! 
 My 150 words prose 
 Excited but sure they’d soon find me out, I was a 1987 graduate trainee for British Gas ‘Productivity Services’. One of four women, plus a 'right Sheffield lass', in a department of fifty, mostly middle-aged men. 
 ‘Induction’? More like ‘baptism of fire’ to catch me out - passed like a rugby ball around a main-laying gang; in agony because I wouldn’t  ‘piss in the trench’  like the rest of them; running up and down cellar steps chasing the speed-walking shop steward, stop watch in hand, supposedly rating meter reading for bonus schemes - not a word all eight hours til we parted: 
 ‘Tha’s not bad for a lass..’ 
 I cried all the way home with exhaustion and pride. 
 Sara helped me out of bed to face the office the next day. A quiet new respect - they’d all heard the union report. More than equal? 
 It got better after that! 
 I could write much more about my first job at British Gas - there were several intakes of graduate trainees in the late 1980’s deliberately recruited to help shift the culture following it’s privatisation (including the young men in this photo - not responsible for 'fitting me up' in those early days). Consequently we were a strong and resourceful bunch and some of my best times were spent on residential courses or partying with these independent quick thinkers. But having avoided the traditional female departments, my time in (and out of) the office was often much more testing than the actual work. 
 What do you remember? 
 
 Here 's how you join in: 
 A REMINDER OF HOW THE BITE-SIZE MEMOIR CHALLENGE WORKS 
 
 Each  Friday  I’ll suggest a topic by 2pm UK time (BST) via my blog and Twitter (using the hashtag  #BiteSizeMemoir  - You don’t need to be on Twitter to participate.) 
 
 2. The challenge will be to write about the topic using 
 either 
 10 x “I remember statements” 
 or 
 150 x words  (No more ! - Prose or poetry if you want to stretch yourself) 
 Either will make you pick and choose your words carefully whilst keeping a tight focus for time’s sake. You might want to write more, to keep at home, but please only submit one option within the limits for sharing (i.e. 10 statements or 150 word prose/poem) 
 3.  The  Deadline  for sharing your ‘Bite’ will be  2pm  (BST) the **** following  Thursday . You can share in either of two ways: 
 a)  Post your response in the comments section of the current topic - I will find it and cut and paste to the compilation of responses. (You may not see your comment appear immediately but don’t worry - I will find and share it) 
 or 
 b)  If you have a blog you can post your response on your own blog with a link back to this post, and then also provide the link to me in the comments section. I will then link your contribution back to your post, in the compilation of responses. 
 4.  It would be great if you felt able to include the country the events took place in - I won’t enforce this but I think it provides a significant context for other readers. As an example look at the compilation for  "School at Seven" 
 5.   I will aim to compile responses and share them via another post before the next challenge is issued. 
 __ 
 A few rules: 
 1. If you need or want to be anonymous that’s fine - When you post a comment just put ‘Anon’ or a nickname in the name field. It does ask for an email address as part of spam filtering but only I will see it.
2. Please keep others anonymous to protect their privacy and dignity - change names or use initials etc.
3. If you’ve got an axe to grind, please do it somewhere else.
4. If you stumble across this after the deadline, do feel free to contribute and include your blog link in the comments section of the compilation, so others can read it.
 
 Please remember to submit your Bite Size Memoir by 2pm (BST) Thursday 12th June 2014. Have fun !

 Lisa Reiter 
 Hi, I’m Lisa and in 2000, aged 34, I was diagnosed with terminal sarcoma and given less than 6 months to live. After floundering around getting my head around cancer not being as curable as the adverts of the time were suggesting, I delved into an unknown and for me, a then uncomfortable world of 'alternative' therapies. I'm now 51 and still here. As my oncologist said at one point, I'm an 'experiment of one' which means no scientist would like to draw conclusions! However, I am far from alone in getting success from looking to diet and mind-body techniques to help my body to do its own healing. I’m writing my story for anyone who wants some inspiration or understanding of what being in this situation is all about. Writing it is slow going so I'm using this blog to keep me company as well as discuss the challenges of writing about it all. If I manage to inspire just one person to feel a bit more in control of their own situation, it will all have been worthwhile.

 I went to Reiterbund Saarbrucken to muck horses and perfect my German. Until then my stable experience was Thelwell ponies in south west England with jolly jodhpur girls cleaning tack and making pancakes on the range. 
 The German set up was a different world of over 50 horses, indoor dressage and separate show jumping arenas, two exercise paddocks, a bar and restaurant ! 
 Thirteen boxes to be mucked out by 9.00am everyday (with incredible hangovers) and then the horses to be brushed and cleaned. Hot afternoons loading muck or unloading hay from wagons. Free time with great friends at beer festivals, BBQs and galloping through the woods.. 
 The horses insisted on speaking German but the people wanted to practice English. Still, my German was good enough to know my faux pas calling a client’s young girlfriend, his daughter. 
 And I came back incredibly fit and strong, to my best rugby season ever!

 What a great look at horse jobs across the pond. We have to muck stalls in the west, too, but gratefully my horses were pastured. Sounds like a great season in life!

 Was going to flunk this challenge, Lisa, as none of my memories felt worth a story, so I’ve splurged on the I remember statements instead: 
I remember not having the energy for both a proper Saturday job AND clubbing till two in the morning. Although it meant less money for clothes, the dancing won out. 
I remember being commissioned to help a neighbour’s son with his reading but his mother’s chatter got in the way. 
I remember poles and theodolites on the hillside with my dad. 
I remember losing a registered letter when delivering the Christmas mail. 
I remember swimming off my fury after a day in the bread wrapper factory. 
I remember expecting to improve my German at the pickle factory but ending up speaking Spanish instead. 
I remember eating constantly through the half hour for lunch and going back to university half a stone heavier. 
I remember putting flies in the pickle jars, but I’d deny it if it ever came to court. 
I remember having more money than I’d ever had in my life, despite we foreigners and girls being paid at a lower rate. 
I remember resolving to work harder at my studies in the hope of landing a less mind-numbing job.

 This is what I love about 'I remember..' Glimpses into all sorts that speak of a brave and rebellious nature - How on earth did you get fat on pickles though?! 
All such valuable stuff - that last one rings true with me and daffodil bulb packing - amazingly mind-numbing after a few hours and there were women there who did those seasonal jobs every year. I realised then what studying was really about. Thanks for not flunking then and now, Lisa x

 If those first jobs were mind-numbing, then understandable that this prompt was tough. Although I always thought those black things in pickles jars were peppercorns. Vinegar is a great disinfectant, but I'll watch more closely now!

 Thanks, both. Alas, Charli, there was a more conscientious girl further down the line who extracted the wildlife and, Lisa, how could we have eaten pickles during the break when the mere thought of them made us want to gag? No, we hitched across the border to the hypermarket in the Netherlands and stocked up on Nutella and delicious bread rolls.

 Beer Koozies and Blinking Buttons 
 I held up my newest uniform for work. “Where’s the rest of it?” 
 “That’s it,” my boss laughed. “It’ll look great. Trust me.” 
 I didn’t trust him. But I did walk out of his office with my piece of fabric pretending to be a dress. I also carried a huge plastic bag of what my boss called “trinkets and trash”—beer koozies, blinking buttons, key chains, and bottle openers. People clambered for this stuff at the bars and clubs. 
 I smiled like the idiot I was supposed to be and handed out these goodies. Even with all the girls in short skirts and low-cut tops, I always felt half naked. Like some nice guy should offer me his coat. None of them ever did. 
 I cringed at some of the bar-hoppers. Others, I laughed at. When you are the only sober person at a bar, human behavior becomes particularly interesting.

 On behalf of the other 50 percent I unreservedly apologize for all grubby little arseholes you came across. As Lisa says I hope this will end. As father to the vet I certainly want never to have to holler at white van man as I did earlier for much longer. Sarah you bring out humour so well when fury at the indignity would be a natural response. No more page three is a start ( does that translate across the pond) but electronic castration is much to recommend it. Rant over.

 It sounds like the cigar girls back in the 1950s. And not a safe element either, especially with the booze. Much easier to take a stand when men are sober. Much easier to be around better men. But that's not always the case and I'm glad that job is behind you! Gives you good material for writing, though. 🙂

 Lisa: Yah, it was pretty bad but I took the job and kept it for a spell. I was earning a lot more than my earlier jobs. (I had such short-lived jobs when I was younger I can barely remember them or what I did there so went with this memorable one.) Nothing compared to Tui's horrible experience. I'm glad I wasn't with her because it might not have been eggs we were throwing. 😉 
 Geoff: Thanks for your heartfelt apology on behalf of the half (who are not all bozos and, btw, sometimes the girls were way worse). I am so happy sometimes that I don't have daughters. I do not envy you what you'll have to deal with as a dad. Also, I just want to say that your compliment really hit me (in a good way) and I hadn't thought about it like that. I appreciate the comment very much. 
 Charli: Ha! Oh my gosh, cigar girls. Yes, that's kind of what it was like. Without the cute, little hat. 😀 (Was it a pillbox or something?) It does give me great material for writing. It really does…

 I want to hear more of your prose version! The picture is grand and it looks as if "80s hair" was a thing across the pond, too. I have so many jobs to pull from-my "chores" had to do with my dad's logging business or my mom's small general store. But my first "real" job was for the Bacon Ranch. It lead me down a strange path of non-traditional jobs, waitressing and freelancing until I went to college with three kids in tow-then I had a "real" career. Now I write! You're right-trying to figure out which is "first" is not easy.
