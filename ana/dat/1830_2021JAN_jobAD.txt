 Bioware to create 200 Jobs in West of Ireland( Galway) 
 Leave a Comment  /  Uncategorized  / By    Katleen  
 Hi all, 
 It's been a while there have been job announcements in Galway, but delighted to see this one! 
Read the full article here: 
 http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/galway-game-firm-to-create-200-jobs-2194357.html 
 To find out the positions they are currently recruiting for :  http://www.bioware.com/bioware_info/jobs/galway_jobs/ 
 And remember, once the Gort to Crusheen Bypass it finished, even if you are coming from further afield, distance is no longer an object( ok, you still need a car!).
