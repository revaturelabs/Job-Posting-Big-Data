 About Levelset 
 Levelset (previously known as  zlien ) is one of the South's fastest-growing tech companies, a flagship of the tech industry in Louisiana, and has been named by New Orleans CityBusiness as the "Best Place to Work" in 2018 for large companies. Backed by venture funding, we are growing revenue (and our headcount) 100% year by year.  We empower contractors to always get what they earn, and it’s our cause to kill liens, slow payment, and bad outcomes. Our software platform makes lien rights in the construction industry simple, so contractors and suppliers can complete projects on time and with the peace of mind that they are going to get paid.
