 Leave a Comment  /  Jobs in Ireland  / By    Katleen  
 Hello Readers, 
 I came across a new recruitment agency that has launched a radio station where you can listen to 
vacancies. The Recruitment agency is called  http://www.verifyrecruitment.com/ 
And you can find the radiostation here :  http://newjobradio.com/ 
 I quite liked watching this video of Donedeal! They are hiring, and it's a great way to have an idea who they are and the vacancies they have : 
 Happy Job Hunting!
