 Career Rebound: Turning Around a Failed Experience 💞 (2 min read)

 We left off with me having an interview for another teaching position. The interview was at the school board. I did well! As such, I was told on the spot that I was, "in." Yesterday, I received another call to interview at a school. I went to bed early and woke up this morning and went to my interview. As a veteran educator, I was surprised that I was asked to complete a writing sample! No problem, I thought. I took out my good Lamy fountain pen and went to work. 😘 
 The interview was flawless, if I do say so myself! The principal asked me, "what are you doing now?" I said, "looking to lock in this position with you." 
 
 Confidence is the key to an amazing interview. 
 Never let them see you sweat. 
 Always smile and be confident in your tone of voice and posture. 
 Dress to impress. 
 Smell good. 
 Walk in like you already have the job. 
 What impresses people the most is your ability to draw them in, with your life experiences & personality. 
 Don't over talk the interviewer. 
 Laugh & smile 
 Have belief in yourself & abilities 
 
 I got the job and can't wait to decorate my classroom. 
 In closing, I did think about my experience in the other school system. I realize, that failure needed to happen in order for me to step into favor with this position. I had been trying to get into this school district for eight years. Teachers never leave, they retire. This year four teachers retired at this one school and the applications were many. The principal told me that, no resumes were up to par, until now.😎 I was appreciative and humbled by that. My motto has alway been work hard; play hard! Be Blessed! 
 xoxo, 
 Lioness Stargazer 🙏🏼😘🏌🏌🏌💋💋
