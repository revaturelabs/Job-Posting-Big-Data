  5 Easy Ways To Make Yourself A More Attractive Job Candidate  
 Lindsay Edwards 
 September 12, 2015 
 With such a competitive job market, it makes sense to work on the way that you present yourself and come across to prospective employers. There are many different things you can do in this respect, but we have come up with five ways which should be easy enough for you to implement.  RELATED: Need help with the job search?  Watch these tutorials!  If you use the tips listed below, you should be on your way to making yourself a more attractive job candidate, and could even land the job you have been lusting after... 
 
 1. Give a great first impression 
 The first thing you will want to look at is your CV, as this is really the document that an HR team will scrutinise and analyse in order to get an idea of you and your skills. There are many resources online that can be used for improving your CV, and there may also be clinics and seminars held in your local area. It is also worth asking amongst your friends and family if they know any recruitment specialists as they may be able to provide you with some pointers. 
 2. Prove you are a safe bet 
 Another aspect of becoming a more attractive candidate is by showing that you are safe, trustworthy, and stay within the law.  Basic disclosure checks  are ideal for this; there is plenty of information available online about how to get one. As an individual, you are able to get a basic disclosure; however in some sectors, an employer may be required to get a standard or enhanced check on your behalf. 
 3. Provide brilliant references 
 Many people only consider references once they have a conditional offer (meaning that you have succeeded in your interview but the employer wants to carry out checks before confirming a full job offer). However this should be something considered at a much earlier stage as it means that you can ensure that your referees fully understand you, your desired career path, and the important points to cover. Ask whether they could provide you with a short version of a reference for your LinkedIn profile. 
 4. Demonstrate extra skills 
 It is always a positive thing if you can go above and beyond a job description, so get thinking about what extra skills you can add to the job. Whether this is a full and clean driving license, or an extra qualification, make sure that these are listed on your CV and are clearly communicated on your cover letter where appropriate. 
 5. Be respectful 
 Finally, you should always ensure that you act in a professional and respectful manner when you are on the hunt for a job. Being too pushy, lazy or hostile can get people’s backs up and will be unlikely to get you an interview or a job offer. Whilst it is acceptable to follow up how your interview went and so on, remember to find the balance between getting feedback and being pushy - it is a fine line that you won’t want to cross. Also, keep in mind dress codes and timeliness whenever you are attending an interview as these are easy boxes to tick.  This post was originally published at an earlier date.
