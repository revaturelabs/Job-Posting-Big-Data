 Class Action News 
 
 On April 3, 2020, a  former employee of Velodyne Lidar filed a class-action lawsuit  against the company for layoffs supposedly related to COVID-19. The plaintiff, Benjamin Siers, filed the lawsuit in San Jose’s US District Court and claims that the autonomous vehicle technology company dismissed more than 140 employees with only one day of written notice. 
 According to the lawsuit, Velodyne “told employees that the layoffs were caused by the recent COVID-19 pandemic, but that representation is not consistent with Velodyne’s recent business activities.” In addition, the lawsuit points out that in the summer of 2019, Velodyne started to transfer production jobs overseas and took numerous outsourcing actions. Siers, who was a production engineer with the company, doesn’t believe that the COVID-19 pandemic caused Velodyne to layoff employees last month. 
 Plaintiff Claims Cuts Were Due to Outsourcing, Not COVID-19 
 In California, companies are required to provide 60 days of written notice of termination under the  Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act . Specifically, businesses must give advanced notice if termination is due to foreseeable circumstances. The members of the class seek “respective wages, salary, commissions, bonuses, accrued holiday pay, and accrued vacation for [the] 60 days following their respective termination.” 
 In mid-March, the company closed its Bay Area operations, which included around 500 employees, as a result of shelter-in-place orders. However, Velodyne said that it would “remain operational as we assess and meet customer needs by utilizing manufacturing centers globally that are currently open.” The company also  scaled back its operations in China  in December after they accused rival companies of stealing intellectual property.

 Client Testimonials 
 
 I wanted to take a minute to thank you and your staff for all you accomplished regarding my most difficult case. I realized gender discrimination was a challenge, however, with your experience and expertise you all took my case head on and never looked back. You fought for me, my rights as a female and after everything was said and done, a. . .win for older females in a male dominated career.

 Without hesitation I am giving a 5 out of 5 stars to Theo Khachaturian. It may sound like a cliché, but when I began working with Theo it felt as though for the first time someone actually listened to me and believed me. He is extremely clear, honest and most importantly very deft at mediation. Theo never filled my head with false promises, and reiterated the reality of what the pros and cons of my case were. My case was resolved in mediation, and without Theo, there wasn’t a chance I would’ve been able to get that far.

 David saved my soul and believed in me. He knows the law and was my advocate every step of the way. He was highly sensitive to my stresses and always responsive to my many questions. He truly cares about his clients. David caught every discrepancy and every contradiction with the opposing counsel. His skills in mediation were phenomenal. If he believes in the merits of your case, you can be assured that nobody will work harder or more passionately than David Simpson.
