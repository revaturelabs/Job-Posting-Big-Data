 Cancer Messed with the Wrong Hellion 
 full-time job 
 Simply the Best Job Yet! 
 January 8, 2017 Tink the Belle 18 Comments 
 A little over a year ago, I received a grim cancer diagnosis from Dr H. 
 This particular surgeon looked far too frail and unsteady to be in a kitchen slicing tomatoes, let alone performing an intricate surgery. 
 I just wanted out of there. 
 Then I had the privilege of meeting Dr K, an oncologist with the bedside manner of a boorish oaf. 
 Dr K. informed me that all the prayers in the world wouldn't be enough to save me. 
 He also made it clear that I could go to 100 different doctors, and they would all confirm this. 
 At that point, I was not fearing cancer as much as being "treated" by these two doctors. 
 So out the door I went, thinking of all the other possibilities that surely must exist. 
 After trying a little of this and some of that, I was doing fairly well. 
 I had taken total charge of my personal health, while doing my best to reduce the level of stress in my life, and even taking an extended time off from work. 
 I became my own full-time job. 
 It was the best job I ever had. 
 Reconnecting with myself. 
 Finally becoming Number One.
