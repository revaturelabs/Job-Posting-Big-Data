 About Puzzl 
 Description 
 Puzzl is a fintech startup focused on building payroll infrastructure. We help companies to build their own embedded payroll products. 
 About the role 
 Skills:  CSS, Express, Git, GraphQL, HTML, JavaScript, MongoDB, Nginx, Node.js, React, Docker 
 Description 
 Puzzl: Payroll infrastructure to help companies build their own payroll. 
 Join our team as a Product Engineer (a full-stack role) where you will iterate on features quickly, build directly for customers, and wear multiple hats. 
 Our team works out of an office in-person in SF, but you may work remotely until end of COVID.  Note: We do not provide sponsorship for employment visas. 
 What We Do 
 Puzzl helps companies-- everyone from gig companies + franchises to POS companies and neobanks-- to build their own embedded payroll products. Some companies want to offer embedded payroll to make an extra stream of revenue and offer their customers end-to-end platform functionality, while others simply want to build payroll to improve payment operations for their internal company. 
 Puzzl has built a Payroll API that automates every aspect of payroll processing from onboarding to disbursement to reporting & filing. Our White-Label Front-End Components allow any company to customize our pre-built front-end products and launch a payroll company in days. You can think of Puzzl as a “Stripe for Payroll”! 
 Payroll is the infrastructure of American society, controlling everything from school and library budgets to child support, to retirement/health savings. Puzzl is the payment and compliance infrastructure layer that helps companies navigate the ever-changing policy changes in 13,000+ tax jurisdictions. 
 Cool Things We Do 
 
 We are the only payroll company that offers  daily payroll ! Most quick-pay versions of payroll are modern versions of payday loans with hefty fees but at Puzzl we can do real payroll calculations and disbursement the same-day so workers can get paid in <24 hours. 
 We help gig companies pay workers compliantly as W2 employees. Before, gig-companies were only able to classify workers as 1099 contractors because they had no way to pay workers quickly and efficiently. Our product serves as a “Stripe for Payroll” for gig startups so they can pay workers quickly and keep payment data in-app. 
 
 Full-Stack Engineering Role 
 You will play a critical role in: 
 
 Product Usability:  We believe in making something people love. You'll be building user-facing tools and developing systems to improve reliability and usability. 
 Customer Success:  Our customers are our #1 priority, and they rely on us for their payment infrastructure. You'll be gathering feedback from customers, iterating our product, and launching new features daily! 
 Help us build out our engineering team:  You'll help us recruit, train, and manage our extended engineering team.
