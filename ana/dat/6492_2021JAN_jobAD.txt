 Build a Single Page App to Design a home renovation App (see Pinterest, Modsy, etc) 
 Role overview 
 JOB DESCRIPTION 
 Have you or a close friend been affected by the housing affordability crisis? Do you believe good design can not only transform a space but also positively impact a person's mental state? By and large millennial homeowners are priced out of urban centers and turnkey homes. With 80% of homes now older than 20 years old, the options for affordable housing are typically dated and underwhelming. With rising costs of new construction, the need for renovations has never been higher, but the process hasn't changed in decades. 
 Skipp is collaborating with world class architects, designers and technologists to not only make the process of transforming a home easier and affordable, but also fun and inspiring. We are an early stage, VC-backed startup, using AI and the latest in spatial technology to simplify the renovation process and democratize access to elevated designs for the everyday homeowner. In just hours Skipp's technology can generate real-time pricing, architect grade documentation, visualizations, and material schedules. With this approach, homeowners can not only access world-class designs for their actual space immediately, but can also efficiently manage their budget and have all the documentation needed for a streamlined RFP and construction process. 
 We are looking for a ClojureScript Frontend engineer with start-up experience. This will be an early hire for the company, one of the first non-founding members on the engineering team with an opportunity to influence the strategic technology direction and company culture. 
 We value talent that likes to experiment with new technologies, new techniques and new processes. We're building something brand new, that no one has seen before and we want fresh ideas matched with a “get it done” attitude. As part of a small team, you will be expected to share your ideas, seek feedback and provide feedback on other areas of the system. The best team members will know how it all fits together. 
 We draw on the best agile techniques of the past several decades: continuous integration and deployment, unit testing, flexible collaboration with distributed team members via chat and video, Q&A structured knowledge base, iterable processes and improvement. 
 Our backend is predominantly written in Clojure, with a Datomic database. All deployed in AWS. We also use python for some integration work and DevOps work. Overall, our technology stack is designed for rapid iteration, application of Machine Learning and scale. 
 Open to junior level through senior level. 
 BONUS QUESTION 
 Given what you know about Skipp now, the architecture/construction space and the technologies we're using, what would you propose as a Hack day project? 
 QUALIFICATIONS 
 
 
 Two years or more with frontend technologies and programming 
 
 
 Some experience and familiarity with ClojureScript (or Clojure and other frontend technology) 
 
 
 Experience with React and modern approaches for building an SPA (Single Page App) 
 
 
 Comfortable working at a startup, prior startup experience (fast-paced, rapid iteration, evolving requirements) 
 
 
 An understanding and preference for data-driven architectures 
 
 
 Must have ideas and opinions. What do  you  want to explore? 
 
 
 Bonus: Any experience with AEC (Arch, eng, constructions) appreciated. Have you worked in the AEC industry before? Have you engaged in your own home renovations? Have you changed a light fixture or painted your home? Anything? 
 
 
 Bonus: Any experience with Datomic 
 
 
 Bonus: WebGL / three.js or Unity Engine development 
 
 
 FUNCTIONS 
 
 Participate in all phases of the work: design, coding, debugging, documentation, etc 
 Performs system analysis and programming activities which may require research 
 Help to gather requirements from the product, marketing, and operations teams 
 Responsibility for managing your own tasks and sprints 
 
 PROJECTS 
 As part of a small team, you will be asked to work on a wide range of projects which will shift over time. You will have a lot of say into which projects you are interested in and will want to focus on. 
 The initial project is a rewrite of our customer portal. The initial portal was a fast iteration on Bubble and custom javascript. We now have new designs and new functions and want to build a second generation application (SPA style) from the ground up. Functionality includes messaging, document management, curating collections for the user's personal moodboard (pinterest-like), design catalog browsing. Later versions will include a 3D visualizer for material selection and display of the renderings.
