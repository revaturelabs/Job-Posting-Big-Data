 Here are some of the top trends in recruiting that promise to change the way organizations identify, engage, and ultimately hire top talent in the coming years and how employers can adapt procedures to these changes to ensure a successful recruiting program. 
 There are three major trends in how companies connect with top talent in today’s challenging recruiting landscape. These include: 
 1. Increasing role of the employer brand 
 Two-thirds of HR leaders surveyed say their organization is more focused on employer branding than they were 5 years ago. Additionally, more than half (57%) attribute their company’s ability to attract top talent to a strong brand. Not only does an enhanced employer brand help draw in qualified candidates, but it can also lead to improved corporate awareness and reputation. 
 Moreover, the top three reasons why organizations succeed in attracting top talent were found to be a pronounced reputation and brand, strong industry appeal, and competitive salary and benefits. These factors further drive the need for companies to continually enhance their brand to stand out as an employer of choice. 
 2. Culture and aptitude fit win over skills 
 Company culture has an enormous impact on attracting and retaining top talent, which explains why many of the companies noted for their unique, enjoyable work cultures are also some of the most profitable. Investing in the creation and continuous improvement of a differentiated company culture should be a priority for C-suite executives. At the same time, aptitude, personality, and cultural fit will emerge as key factors in the talent selection process, favored over traditional hiring factors, such as specific qualifications. 
 Focusing on aptitude and attitude to do the job, and investing in learning and development to build needed skills and qualifications, will enable organizations to expand their talent pool and enhance their culture. 
 3. The rise of online talent communities 
 More employers will build robust talent communities throughout 2015 to engage with a larger talent pool. This will provide access to passive and active candidates, past applicants, current and former employees, and other members who help employers find the talent they’re looking for. 
 Overall, the company found that 50% of employers plan to invest in social media and online community management in 2015 to better tap this source of talent.

 What questions are employers prohibited from asking a job candidate under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)? 
 Preemployment inquiries and the ADA 
 Under the ADA, an employer may not ask about the existence, nature, or severity of a disability until the employer has made the applicant a conditional job offer. 
 However, an employer may describe to applicant what the hiring process involves (e.g., a written test) and ask him or her whether he or she will need a reasonable accommodation for the hiring process. 
 An employer may also ask a job applicant if he or she needs a reasonable accommodation, if the employer knows that this applicant has a disability—either because it is obvious or the applicant has voluntarily disclosed the information—and could reasonably believe that the applicant will need a reasonable accommodation. 
 Likewise, an employer may inquire about an applicant’s ability to perform job-related functions, with or without reasonable accommodation. This can be accomplished by describing a particular job duty (e.g., carrying 50-pound bags from a loading dock)—and then asking whether the applicant can perform that function or demonstrate how to perform it. 
 Preemployment inquiries and the FMLA 
 There are no specific FMLA statutory or regulatory requirements regarding preemployment inquiries. However, it is not advisable to ask about leave previously taken, because the question could indicate discriminatory intent or an intent to retaliate against the employee’s protected exercise of leave rights.

 Thoughts of IT, engineering, and computer science don’t normally conjure up images of people who are the life of the party. Or even those who enjoy exchanging pleasantries. But, these unicorns of the tech world—those that have technical talent  and  people skills—do actually exist. You just have to know how and where to find them. 
 What 's in a name? 
 The first instinct of any recruiter or HR professional is to look at the title. This can be a grave misstep because titles are often misleading. Titles like Field Engineer or Systems Administrator may not imply the full extent of the candidate’s experience working with others. While technical-sounding, candidates with these titles actually have to work alongside staff and clients on a consistent basis. What’s a good way to make sure that you fully understand someone’s communication ability through his or her resume? 
 See if they have any consulting experience. The word “consultant” doesn’t have to be in the title, either. For example, an applicant with experience in website coding design probably has had to communicate with clients and staff to deliver the desired result. Producing designs that are aligned with a company’s brand requires a high-level understanding of what a company’s culture is all about. Awareness of company culture is usually an indicator of someone who can appreciate the value of a company’s people. 
 So they can talk the talk, but can they walk the walk? 
 Once you’ve found someone who appears to have all the skills on paper, how do you know if they can walk the walk? A technical skills screen is probably the first thing that comes to mind, but it isn’t the only thing you should be doing. 
 It’s crucial to make the most out of group interviews and phone screens. Seeing how people interact with others is a good way to gauge overall social skills, so is asking questions about what they do and don’t like about their current or previous positions. And then there’s the all-important question: would I enjoy going to dinner with this person? If they seem like someone you’d enjoy spending time with outside of the office, it’s likely they’ll be just as interesting to work with. 
 Hold the phone, social media is important too? 
 The phone screen doesn’t have to be brutally difficult. It can actually be quite the opposite. In addition to observing how easy they are to communicate with over the phone, asking people simple, casual questions—such as what they like to do outside of work or what they’re truly passionate about—can give insight into their like or dislike of social interaction. 
 You can tell a lot from a phone call, but you can tell a whole lot more about an applicant by their presence on social media and in their professional networks. People who have robust, but appropriate, social media profiles and who regularly attend networking events are usually people who enjoy the company of others. 
 However, even the most people-oriented of tech talent may not be on LinkedIn. The reason is simple—tech talent is in high demand and many of the people with those skillsets don’t want to be bombarded by recruiters. If you do find a qualified applicant through LinkedIn with a strong profile and a few solid recommendations, chances are you’ve got someone with potential. 
 You may have found the perfect candidate, now what? 
 So you’ve found the illusory candidate with a mix of tech talent and people skills online. How do you woo them? By being personal. All too often, recruiters search strictly by title without doing any research about the individual before reaching out. Even though you may be searching for people with hard technical skills, they probably are driven by more than just a paycheck. 
 Take time to figure out what someone’s previous work experience is and allude to it in your initial email. Be sincere when you ask them about what they want their job to look like, or what their passions are. A smart recruiter and HR professional shouldn’t just be looking for a technical skills fit—they should also be looking for potential employees who are looking to advance their careers over the long run. 
 Searching for candidates with both the right technical skills and a big personality may seem like a lost cause. However, the more effort that’s put in to get to know the person behind the credentials, the more satisfied the person—and the company—is going to be with the job fit.

 Why Conduct Background Checks on Potential Employees?

 by Bridget Miller  | BLR 
 Does your organization conduct background checks as part of the hiring process? Many organizations do, but the type of background check—and the extent of it—varies considerably. Let’s take a look at some of the most pertinent reasons so many businesses opt to perform some type of background check on any potential new employee. 
 Some of the Reasons for Conducting a Background Check 
 Probably the biggest reason employers choose to perform background checks on potential employees is safety and security. Employers have an obligation under OSHA to provide a safe workplace—one that is free of known hazards. It can be easily argued that hiring an individual with violent tendencies—tendencies that could have been discovered with due diligence—would represent a disregard for that obligation. As such, many employers opt to perform at least a criminal background check on potential employees before finalizing any offer of employment. 
 Similarly, if an individual causes harm to anyone—such as a customer or vendor—the employer may be liable if there was an opportunity to learn about this tendency, such as the existence of a public criminal record. 
 Security is another concern, especially for jobs in which an individual is responsible for cash or for making decisions that affect the company’s profitability or reputation. For any individual in these roles, employers often consider doing a background check that confirms the individual does not have a history of fraud, negligence, or theft, for example. 
 Background checks can also be done on a more limited scale. Technically, even calling references is a form of background screening. In these situations, an employer is trying to gauge what the potential employee is like to work with, to better ensure it will be a good fit. These can also be done as a means to try to uncover any fabrications or exaggerations on the application, résumé, or during the interview. 
 Conducting Background Checks: Some Caveats 
 Despite these very good reasons to conduct an employee background check, there are limits to what an employer can discover and use. For example: 
 
 Employers should be careful not to make decisions based solely on arrest records. An arrest is not the same as a conviction, and some protected groups may be disproportionately affected by a policy that disallows a perspective employee due to any arrest—thus making such a policy discriminatory. 
 Credit checks and other background checks require employee consent. Without consent, such checks can be illegal, depending on what type of check is conducted. Consult legal counsel and get advance permission before conducting background screenings. Additionally, if you use an employee’s credit rating as part of the background screening process, first be sure there is a legitimate business purpose for doing so. Otherwise, this alone can be a form of discrimination if potential employees are excluded based on credit. This is because lower credit scores disproportionately affect some protected groups, and eliminating on this basis alone would create a disparate impact on these groups. Even with a legitimate business purpose for checking a credit score, the employer must also be sure to follow the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) rules. 
 Background checks can inadvertently turn up information that discloses an employee’s inclusion in a protected class. Even if this information is not used in the hiring process, it is risky for an employer to have such information at this stage because it raises the possibility of a discrimination claim. For this reason, many employers use third-party services to conduct background checks—and those service providers only turn over information that is relevant to the hiring process, insulating the employer from knowledge about protected class inclusion and other information that should not be used in hiring decisions. 
 There are many federal, state, and local laws that limit the type of information that an employer can seek out—be sure to consult local laws and understand the limitations. 
 Be sure any background screening is relevant to the job. For example, there is probably no need to get a driving record for someone who will not be driving for the company in any capacity. 
 Be consistent in conducting background checks. Do not conduct background checks only for certain applicants but not others who are up for the same job. It’s OK to only conduct background screening after you’ve made a short list, but it’s not OK to only conduct background checks on individuals of specific groups, such as minorities or immigrants. Be consistent in the hiring process for each job opening. 
 When something is uncovered during a background screening, consider giving the applicant the opportunity to share more information about the situation. While you still need to be consistent in how the situation is handled, it’s always possible that there’s a mistake that can be rectified or there are extenuating circumstances that change the view of the situation. Of course, if you’re going to give the opportunity for explanations, be consistent and offer this opportunity every time the situation arises. 
 
 Does your company conduct employee background checks? What advice would you provide based on your experience?

 Keeping Those Candidates on the Line

 Always Follow Up ,  applying for a job ,  Candidates ,  dallas temp jobs ,  interview process ,  job duties ,  job search dfw ,  rockwall jobs ,  trend personnel services 
 by Stephen Bruce  | BLR 
 This crucial moment can play out in so many different ways, and most of that is up to you. Consider these Do’s and Don’ts. 
 DO: 
 
 Clearly introduce who you are, and be sure to include the name of your company. 
 State your purpose for calling. 
 By all means, flatter your candidates. Let them know you have specially picked them from a large pool of candidates. After all of your sourcing and preparation, this is very true! 
 Take your time and add a few short pauses here and there. Candidates should feel in control of the conversation and have enough time to think. If they didn’t expect a call from you, they might be on-guard or suspicious. A little space in a conversation can put them at ease. 
 
 DON’T: 
 
 Do not offer them an interview for the same day, or even the next day, even if you really want that position filled quickly. Give your candidate time to do some research. Besides, rushing the process makes you seem desperate. 
 Never forget to explain in detail how the interview process works. Let them know what time and where they will be meeting, and with whom they will be meeting. Make sure to give them time to write it down, and if there are any other steps involved, let them know. Give them clear, easy steps to follow. This helps eliminate uncertainty. 
 Never misrepresent your company or the position. If candidates ask about the company, use clear terms to describe it. Also, make sure to tell them the job duties in accurate, straightforward terms. The candidate should arrive at the interview ready to talk about the actual job you want them to fill. If their interview doesn’t match the initial phone call, you are likely to lose the candidate. 
 Do not answer any questions about pay during the initial phone call. Sometimes a candidate will want to talk pay up front. Unless you work for a company where positions come with fixed pay, it’s best if you don’t mention any numbers at this time. At this point, your guess might not align with what they could see down the road in an offer. Experts agree that failure to be honest about pay can cost many companies good candidates. 
 
 Always Follow Up 
 So, you’ve made the call and hopefully you have an interview scheduled. The candidate knows what he or she is supposed to do, and when. So why would you follow up? This business practice is polite and it helps put the candidate at ease. Just shoot the person a quick e-mail shortly after you talk summarizing what you talked about. Send another e-mail the day before or early the day of the interview confirming the time and location. Make sure the candidate knows that he or she can contact you with any questions. In fact, some form of communication should take place at each step of the entire process. Employees expect this, and when it doesn’t happen, they feel adrift. 
 What if you decide not to go with that candidate? What if someone else gets hired before the interview? If this ends up being the case, you should still send a note gently letting the person know what has transpired. It may be hard to give someone bad news, but it is worse not to contact them at all. Studies have shown that people who are cold-shouldered by companies at any point during the interview process will often bad-mouth the company to their friends and family, as well as on social media. You may not see it directly, but a bad reputation gets around, and it may cost you in ways you didn’t anticipate.

 Why You Can’t Afford Not to Hire College Graduates

 By Krista Williams | BLR 
 I have been working with college students … well, since I was in college. In most, if not all, of my positions I have had the fortune of working with interns, new graduates, placement offices, faculty, and students. My support has not only been to assist in job placement but also to support the transition of students from the life of ramen noodles and 10 a.m. classes to meeting the demands of a completely connected work environment with high expectations. 
 I enjoy the aspect of the students being full of life, holding huge aspirations, and having absolutely no idea how to get where they are trying to go. I have partnered with placement offices at several colleges and managed college hiring programs for several organizations. Over the years, some things have changed and some things haven’t at all. Here is what I have learned and what I would advise hiring managers to keep in mind: 
 Students have very limited views of the types of positions they can actually perform once they graduate. 
 They need to speak with a lot of people in various industries in order to be able to make an educated decision about where they should be focusing their career search efforts. There are several places that we are able to assist and make an impact on college graduate entry into our desired markets. 
 As a prospective employer, you can offer internship programs, volunteer to be a guest speaker, participate as a guest panelist, and/or sign up for career day involvement as a start. 
 Companies should hire for potential, not experience. 
 A pickle we often get in is that if we do have entry-level positions, we think we are too busy to slow down enough to train someone without experience. I disagree. This is an opportunity to take someone without any preconceived notions about what it is like to work for an employer—someone who has not developed any bad habits yet—and completely mold him or her into the type of worker we would like. This particularly helps in high production environments of companies with really elevated goal structures. If you are able to attract highly talented, motivated, bright, competitive staff, they will only have one another to compare themselves to—not a slower paced previous past place of employment. 
 Provide training and opportunity. 
 Whether it is on the desk or in the training room, make sure you are providing an environment where your eager, fresh graduates can continually learn. They are coming off many years of absorbing lots and lots of information and let’s face it, if you don’t use it, you lose it. Make sure that you keep your new hires challenged, interested, and involved. 
 Don’t worry about whatever path you thought was good enough for you or others several years ago. Allow effort, production, and results to speak for themselves and reward based on performance. 
 Although I will be the first to admit that sometimes time is the best teacher, as you get to experience lifecycles and events recurring, don’t let too much time go by and allow the next best opportunity to come from an outside employer. The first several moves or promotions for fresh graduates (once earned) should be made in shorter time intervals their first 2–5 years of work. Otherwise, you may stand to lose your rising leaders to competitors who may appear to value their worth sooner than you do. Stay abreast of talent, how marketable they are, and make sure they are rewarded appropriately. 
 There is a great amount of opportunity for everyone if we work together and have the right frame of mind. So, next time you think you must have 3–5 years’ experience in a hire, think again. And take a close look at the advantages of hiring a fresh college grad.

 3 Tips for Keeping Your Spirits Up During a Lengthy Job Search

 Looking for a work can be the hardest job you’ll ever have, and sometimes it can go on for quite a while. It can be a daunting, frustrating, humbling, and nerve-racking experience to search month after month for the right opportunity. New research suggests that having a positive attitude can have a profound impact on your job search. 
 You’ll be happier, more optimistic, and have more energy if you have a good attitude during this time. It will help you stay motivated and allow you to put your best foot forward during interviews and throughout the hiring process. 
 Here are a few tips. 
 1. Schedule your job search like it’s a job. 
 Set a schedule for yourself. Decide when you’ll look for work and where you’ll do it. This can be essential when you’re already working, in order to put in the necessary time at the end of the day and on weekends to pursue your search. But, even if you’re looking for work full-time, scheduling a time and place for your job hunt will help you stay on track. Some people find that spending time in a public place, like a library or cafe, can help them enjoy the process a little more, and it can also help with focus and motivation. 
 2. Allow yourself to take mental breaks for the process. 
 When you’re not looking for work, in the evenings for example, try to give yourself a rest from thinking about it. You know that you’re putting time and effort into it, and you know you’ll be back at it tomorrow, so spend some time thinking about other things and giving yourself a break intellectually and emotionally from the process. 
 3. Know that it could take awhile. 
 For professionals, finding a new job generally takes anywhere from six months to two years. Various factors contribute to the duration, but either way you cut it, this could take some time. Try not to get frustrated or discouraged if you don’t land on something great right away. You want to find a job that is the right fit for you, and that takes time. 
 Once you know that you’re putting the appropriate amount of time into your search, that you’re allowing yourself to take breaks, and that it could take a while, try to find a way to enjoy this time. There are probably opportunities available to you now, because of your flexibility, that won’t be there once you land that new and exciting position. Try to take advantage of those opportunities and enjoy this time. Keeping your spirits up during a job search isn’t easy, but it could be the key to finding and landing the job you’re looking for.

 5 Ways To Get Noticed By Recruiters

 by Catherine | Monster 
 1. Show   No Fear 
 “The best way to stand out to recruiters is to stand up to them” says Joseph Terach, CEO at career services firm. “Don't let them overly influence your preferences for work responsibilities, arrangements or salary based on their reported understanding of the employer." 
 Your job search is your own, even if they are helping. Terach recommends listening to the insider information recruiters can provide, “but keep in mind that recruiters have split allegiances and are salespeople at the end of the day.” 
 2. Communicate 
 Knowing what you want is a great way to stand out, Terach says. You’re not just looking for “a job”; you can tell the recruiter the job you want. 
 “If you come to the table with a crisp professional pitch, not only will your recruiter know exactly what it is you want (and don't want), but they will also be more able to discuss you and communicate your background to potential employers,” he says. “It will save you time because you won't be getting calls for interviews that don't interest you; and when your recruiter finds the right job for you (one that fits your pitch), he/she will have zero reservations to get behind your candidacy 100 percent.” 
 3. Be Honest 
 You of course want to put your best foot forward when dealing with recruiters, but it’s important to be candid about any shortcomings you have as well, says Heather Neisen, talent coordinator. “Self-awareness and honesty are extremely important. Be proud to share your strengths and passions, but also be able to openly discuss areas where you need — or better yet, want — to improve.” 
 Many candidates don’t realize being honest about their shortcomings actually offers a chance to shine, she says. “Admit them and offer ways you’re trying to overcome them. Few things are worse than a candidate who believes they have nothing left to learn.” 
 4. Highlight Your Tenure 
 If you’ve got staying power, promote it, says Andy Barberio, account executive at Fortus Healthcare Resources. “I always look at tenure — tenure is really big. When you find somebody that’s been with an organization for a long time or has helped build it up, they are marketable. Switching jobs every year or year and a half over a five to six year period doesn’t present the best on a resume.” 
 5. Let Yourself Shine 
 Barberio says you can’t teach personality, but if you have it, flaunt it. “Personality and fit and being able to relate to staff is tough,” but it’s what recruiters are looking for. Some positions just require “a special kind of person,” he explains, and recruiters will try to get a feel for who you are when they are meeting with you. Being yourself will help the recruiter find the best fit for you and your skills.

 by Vanessa Merit Nornberg | Inc. 
 Hiring is the Achilles heel of all small companies. Good candidates are hard to find, and the recruiting process always seems to take more time than planned. 
 Here 's what they are: 
 
 Allow six months for the recruitment process.  Hiring when you have a start date in mind that is just around the corner causes you to accept candidates you would have otherwise passed over. Give yourself three months to search for and screen applicants, one month so a new hire can give notice to her current employer, and at least two months to train a new person. 
 Write a job post that accurately describes your company.  Believe it or not, you don't want to emphasize the qualities you need in a candidate in a job description. You want to tell a prospective candidate about what makes your company a different or special place to work, to insure you get interest from people who are the right cultural fit. It's far less expensive to teach skills than attitude to a new recruit. 
 Make the interview process several steps.  Candidates who want any job-and not necessarily the job you are hiring for-rarely take the time to apply if they know they have to go above and beyond a one-click submisssion just to get looked at. 
 Handle at least one part of the recruiting process yourself.  Whether it be screening resumes, doing phone interviews, or conducting the first interview. The earlier you get involved in the recruiting the better the chances you have of finding the right candidate (and weeding out the others!). No one knows your company's needs better than you. 
 Identify the five most important qualities for the positiong you 're filling.  Create interview questions that measure these five qualities to allow you to determine if a candidate possesses them or not. 
 Do more than ask questions when you interview.  Set up opportunities to observe how an applicant handles herself in situations similar to the ones she will be asked to handle if she's hired. For example, if she will be organizing data for your company, give her data to classify, and pay attention to the way she does it. Does her approach match how you do things at your company? Does she follow a logic you can understand? 
 Bring others in on your recruiting process.  Make sure strong candidates are evaluated by at least two members of your team in addition to you. Instincts are important in picking the right candidate, but sometimes you end up on the fence. Having someone to talk about the candidate with can help you get clarity when it matters. 
 Create a training program.  Make sure your training program truly reflects the tasks a hire will be called upon to do. And then formalize it so the new hire can understand where she is at in the training process at all times. 
 Reevaluate both what you teach a new hire and what he retains on a regular basis.  Never be afraid to slow down the training process, teach a concept again, shift gears, or add new modules as you go. The idea is not to train fast, but to train right. Taking the time to do it once and thoroughly will shield your customers from errors, and your company from lost loyalty. 
 Be honest with yourself throughout the training process.  If you make a hiring mistake, don't waste precious time and money hoping it will eventually turn out okay. It won't. Let the candidate go immediately. It is better to have no help at all than to have the wrong help. 
 
 Recruiting the right team can seem daunting, but it is also extremely exciting. Taking the time to make the best hire rather than just any hire is a chance to expand your team's competencies, grow your customer base, and take your company to a new level. Hopefully these 10 tricks will help you.

 The issue of unfilled positions is a major problem that affects the entire economy. It makes it difficult for small businesses to grow if they cannot adequately and quickly staff key positions. But what can employers do? Some of the solutions that organizations have turned to include: 
 
 Evaluate your pay and benefits for positions that are hard to fill.  Are you leading or lagging in the market? You may have to bite the bullet and offer more, especially if you have been relatively stagnant with your annual increases in rate ranges. 
 Offer training programs to existing employees or candidates.  Many employers are finding success by instituting their own training programs in order to get the skills they need when candidates don’t already have them. Pay will be lower than for fully trained individuals, and you get to train people in your specific systems and to your specific standards. 
 Work with local education and/or training institutions.  Perhaps they will be able to offer the type of training you need candidates to have. 
 Send employees to school.  Similarly, some employers are opting to pay for the education that their existing employees need in order to advance into new positions. 
 Widen the recruiting parameters.  Maybe you need to recruit from an expanded geographical area and commit to paying relocation expenses. 
 Consider telecommuting.  Many employers don’t like telecommuting but have found that that’s the only way they can attract the candidates they want. 
 Change too-specific experience requirements to be broader.  Sometimes industry-specific experience is a nice-to-have but not a must-have requirement to find a well-qualified candidate, and some employers have recognized this and revised their requirements accordingly. 
 Provide customized assistance.  When you run into a situation like a dual-career couple, or someone whose home is “underwater,” figure out what sort of package you can put together to solve the candidate’s problem—and yours. 
 Consider outsourcing the function.  Is this a task that can be performed by contracting it out? 
 Work on building your employment brand.  Employers that have a reputation as a “great place to work” have an easier time with recruiting.
