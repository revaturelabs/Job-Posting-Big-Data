 Developer tools to make data privacy easy. Solving CCPA & GDPR for teams big & small. 
 Role overview 
 As Ethyca's  inaugural Solutions Engineer  , you'll be responsible for owning the technical aspects of our customer lifecycle, whether it's post-sale technical implementation or ongoing technical consulting and troubleshooting. You'll partner closely with our Customer Success team, and over time, we'll look to you to further build out processes and best practices to ensure our customers' technical success with our product. The Customer Success team requires technical expertise that can act as the liaison between customers, the customer-facing success managers and other parts of the organization including engineering and product. When interacting with customers, be ready to talk to engineers of every variety, lawyers, and business operations resources alike; you know how to quickly locate the root cause of technology challenges that can occur from the time a customer signs up for Ethyca to the time they start processing their 100th data subject request. Your super power is in translating complex technical concepts for customers and internal stakeholders to understand. In this role, you will lay the foundations for process building and creating long-term relationships between Ethyca and our customers. 
 What you will do 
 
 Analyze and document customer requirements and data patterns/flow. 
 Configure and test new integrations per the customers’ requirements. 
 Deploy, configure and test java-based privacy agents for the customer. 
 Document customer implementations and configurations. 
 Work closely with Ethyca’s product team to deliver product feedback and stay current on product releases and roadmap features. 
 Maintain a deep understanding of Ethyca’s product feature set and the growing privacy landscape. 
 Serve as a consultant, providing excellent customer service and maintaining excellent customer relationships. 
 Identify, ticket and resolve customer issues in a timely manner, working with product engineering team as needed 
 Develop internal and external processes and workflows to increase efficiencies across the user customer onboarding journey. 
 
 
 Who you are 
 
 A  self-starting software engineer at heart . With 5-7 years of engineering or technical implementation experience working with SaaS software products, you know  just enough  SQL and noSQL, how to modify terraform scripts, how to manage kubernetes pods, and are a general expert in cloud service management (AWS, GCP, Azure). 
 Empathetic to our customers and their needs. You’ve been in a customer-forward role for 1-3 years as a technical resource and are able to lead conversations with confidence. Customers demand a lot from a data privacy compliance product. We are here to first ensure that our customers are compliant with data protection laws. 
 An experienced  integrator  , having worked with infrastructure, net-sec-ops, devops teams, data/base engineering teams, and product engineering teams and knowing how and when to engage each. 
 A relentless  troubleshooter . No problem too tough, no issue too elusive; we are looking for someone who will tackle a customer deployment or implementation problem and work through it, rather than around it. 
 An  egoless, yet expert  technical liaison between Ethyca product engineering team and Ethyca’s customers. We rely on your expertise of knowing the customer’s setup to inform both product delivery and roadmap. 
 
 We are hiring US-based candidates for this remote role with a preference toward candidates in the NYC area as the role will require East coast working hours. 
 
 Benefits 
 
 Cash + Equity + Bonus 
 Health, Dental, and Vision insurance fully paid by the company 
 Flexible office hours & vacation policy 
 Maternity & Paternity leave 
 Commuter discounts 
 
 We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. We strongly believe that diversity of experience, perspectives, and the background will lead to a better environment for our employees and a better product for our users 
 
 What's it like to work at Ethyca? 
 At its core, Ethyca is engineering company. We're building a missing component of the internet's infrastructure - privacy-respecting data systems. We take on some of the most challenging technical problems in data privacy so that other engineering teams can focus on building their products and businesses safe in the knowledge their tech stack handles privacy and ethics seamlessly. 
 As such, we care more than most about trust and ethics - our name is a reflection of that belief - and we think deeply about the affect of ethics in data-driven systems and carry that belief through to our teams respect for each other and our transparency in the companies direction and goals to solve some of the most pressing problems in the technology community.
