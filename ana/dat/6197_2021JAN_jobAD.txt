 Alphabet Idea: Jobs - what do people do all day? 
 June 27, 2014June 28, 2014  •  mrbullock 
 Build an alphabet of jobs, careers and the things that people might do for a living… 
 P is for Policewoman 
 C is for Car Mechanic 
 Z is for Zoologist 
 X is for Xenobiologist (Cool!) 
 This could be used as a challenging drama project, where groups must mime each job and record a few seconds for the alphabet. 
 Making 26 jobs that all look different and recognisable would be a demanding task that taxed their imagination, problem solving and stage craft to the upmost.
