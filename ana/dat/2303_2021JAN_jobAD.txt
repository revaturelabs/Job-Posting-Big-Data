  6 Reasons You Should Say 'Yes' To Any Job Interview  
 ZipRecruiter 
 October 13, 2013 
 You applied for a job and were just called in for a job interview. The only problem? You're having second thoughts about the position. Maybe the pay is low or the job function isn't quite what you're looking for. Or maybe the company culture is a bit dry for your taste. Whatever the cause of your cold feet, you should think twice before turning down any job interview. Here's why... 
 
 1. Sharpen Your Interview Skills 
 Google “interview tips." Guess how many results turn up? 9,300,000. Why so many? Because interviews aren't easy. They're awkward, pressure-filled situations that demand your A-game. No number of advice articles or practice interviews will prepare you as much as the real thing, so suit up and take advantage of the opportunity. 
 2. Discover What Others In Your Industry Are Up To 
 Job interviews are an excellent learning opportunity. Once you're done practicing your responses to common interview questions, take the time to quiz the employer. Inquire about position requirements, departmental strategies, and company goals. Take what you learn and use it to your advantage into future interviews. 
 3. Build Your Network 
 The fact you applied to this job and were offered an interview suggests you'll be doing business with similar people (perhaps even these people) in the future. Why not use the interview as a networking opportunity? As long as you conduct yourself with professionalism, there's no reason why you shouldn't leave with a few new LinkedIn connections. Maybe they'll even know of an opportunity that's a better fit for you down the road. 
 4. Learn What's Out There 
 Every organization is unique. By visiting a company's campus and talking to its employees, you'll get an insider's look at what it's like to work there. Remember what you like and what you don't, then use these insights as you move forward with picking a new job. 
 5. Gain Bargaining Power 
 It's not uncommon for hiring managers to ask if you're interviewing elsewhere. If you're not, then you won't be seen as a hot commodity. If you can say yes, however, it might give the hiring manager a sense of urgency to scoop you up before someone else does. What's more, having multiple job offers is an excellent bargaining chip when it comes time for salary negotiations. 
 6. Realize You Never Know What Will Happen 
 A million different things can happen to change your perspective of the company or the job. Maybe the salary is low, but the opportunity for advancement (including raises) is through the roof. Or maybe what you've read and heard up to this point doesn't do the company culture justice. There might even be another position open at the company that you're better suited for. The point? You'll never know if you don't go to the interview. As with any business engagement, it is of utmost importance that you act like the professional you are. Don't flake, don't convey your indifference, and don't treat the interview lightly - word gets around. And besides, the hiring manager is taking time out of his day to meet with you because he believes in your qualifications and cultural fit; why treat him with anything less than the respect he deserves? Are there any reasons you can think of to say no to a job interview? **  Enjoy this article? You've got time for another! Check out these related articles: **
